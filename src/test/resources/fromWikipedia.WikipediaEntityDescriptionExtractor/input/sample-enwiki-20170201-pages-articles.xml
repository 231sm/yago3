[[File:Vivaldi.jpg|thumb|Probable portrait of Vivaldi, c.&amp;nbsp;1723.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;An anonymous portrait in oils in the [[International Museum and Library of Music of Bologna|Museo Internazionale e Biblioteca della Musica di Bologna]] is generally believed to be of Vivaldi and may be linked to the [[:File:Vivaldi La Cave.jpg|Morellon La Cave engraving]], which appears to be a modified mirror reflection of it.&quot; Michael Talbot, ''The Vivaldi Compendium'' (2011), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Antonio Lucio Vivaldi''' ({{IPA-it|anˈtɔːnjo ˈluːtʃo viˈvaldi|lang}}; 4 March 1678&amp;nbsp;– 28 July 1741) was an [[Italians|Italian]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/biography/Antonio-Vivaldi&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baroque music|Baroque]] composer, [[virtuoso]] violinist, teacher and [[Clergy|cleric]]. Born in [[Venice]], he is recognized as one of the greatest Baroque composers, and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across Europe. He composed many instrumental [[concerto]]s, for the violin and a variety of other instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than forty [[opera]]s. His best-known work is a series of [[violin concerto]]s known as ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|The Four Seasons]]''.

Many of his compositions were written for the female music ensemble of the ''[[Ospedale della Pietà]]'', a home for abandoned children where Vivaldi (who had been ordained as a [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]]) was employed from 1703 to 1715 and from 1723 to 1740. Vivaldi also had some success with expensive stagings of his operas in [[Venice]], [[Mantua]] and [[Vienna]]. After meeting the [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles VI]], Vivaldi moved to Vienna, hoping for preferment. However, the Emperor died soon after Vivaldi's arrival, and Vivaldi himself died less than a year later in poverty.

==Life==

===Childhood===
[[File:Chiesa di San Giovanni in Bragora - Venezia.jpg|thumb|Church where Vivaldi was baptised: [[San Giovanni in Bragora]], [[Castello, Venice|Sestiere di Castello]], Venice]]

Antonio Lucio Vivaldi was born in 1678 in Venice,&lt;ref name=&quot;TalbotGrove&quot; /&gt; then the capital of the [[Republic of Venice]]. He was [[Baptism|baptized]] immediately after his birth at his home by the midwife, which led to a belief that his life was somehow in danger. Though not known for certain, the child's immediate baptism was most likely due either to his poor health or to an [[earthquake]] that shook the city that day. In the trauma of the earthquake, Vivaldi's mother may have dedicated him to the priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kolneder, ''Antonio Vivaldi: Documents of his life and works'' (Amsterdam: Heinrichshofen's Verlag, Wilhelmshaven, Locarno, 1982), 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Vivaldi's official church baptism took place two months later.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd., 1978), 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vivaldi's parents were Giovanni Battista Vivaldi and Camilla Calicchio, as recorded in the register of [[San Giovanni in Bragora]].&lt;ref&gt;Landon, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Vivaldi had eight siblings: Iseppo Santo Vivaldi, Iseppo Gaetano Vivaldi, Bonaventura Tomaso Vivaldi, Margarita Gabriela Vivaldi, Cecilia Maria Vivaldi , Gerolama Michela Vivaldi, Francesco Gaetano Vivaldi, and Zanetta Anna Vivaldi.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd, 1978), 37.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2016}}&lt;!--The 1978 edition of Talbot's biography mentions only five.--&gt; Giovanni Battista, who was a barber before becoming a professional violinist, taught Antonio to play the violin and then toured Venice playing the violin with his young son. Antonio was probably taught at an early age, judging by the extensive musical knowledge he had acquired by the age of 24, when he started working at the Ospedale della Pietà.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Giovanni Battista was one of the founders of the ''Sovvegno dei musicisti di Santa Cecilia'', an association of musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd., 1978), 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The president of the ''Sovvegno'' was [[Giovanni Legrenzi]], an early Baroque composer and the ''maestro di cappella'' at [[St Mark's Basilica]]. It is possible that Legrenzi gave the young Antonio his first lessons in composition. The Luxembourg scholar Walter Kolneder has discerned the influence of Legrenzi's style in Vivaldi's early liturgical work ''Laetatus sum'' ([[Ryom-Verzeichnis|RV]] Anh 31), written in 1691 at the age of thirteen. Vivaldi's father may have been a composer himself: in 1689, an opera titled ''La Fedeltà sfortunata'' was composed by a Giovanni Battista Rossi – the name under which Vivaldi's father had joined the Sovvegno di Santa Cecilia.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, P. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Vivaldi's health was problematic. His symptoms, ''strettezza di petto'' (&quot;tightness of the chest&quot;), have been interpreted as a form of [[asthma]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; This did not prevent him from learning to play the violin, composing or taking part in musical activities,&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; although it did stop him from playing wind instruments. In 1693, at the age of fifteen, he began studying to become a [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]].&lt;ref&gt;Landon, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; He was ordained in 1703, aged 25, and was soon nicknamed ''il Prete Rosso'', &quot;The Red Priest&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Pincherle, ''Vivaldi: Genius of the Baroque'' (Paris: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 1957), 16&lt;/ref&gt; (''[[Wikt:rosso|Rosso]]'' is Italian for &quot;red&quot;, and would have referred to the color of his hair, a family trait.)

Not long after his ordination, in 1704, he was given a dispensation from celebrating [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] because of his ill health. Vivaldi only said Mass as a priest a few times and appeared to have withdrawn from priestly duties, though he remained a priest.

===At the ''Conservatorio dell'Ospedale della Pietà''===
In September 1703, Vivaldi became ''maestro di violino'' (master of violin) at an [[orphanage]] called the Pio [[Ospedale della Pietà]] (Devout Hospital of Mercy) in Venice.&lt;ref name=&quot;TalbotGrove&quot;&gt;Michael Talbot, &quot;[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/40120 Vivaldi, Antonio]&quot;, ''[[Grove Music Online]]'' {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Vivaldi is most famous as a composer, he was regarded as an exceptional technical violinist as well. The German architect Johann Friedrich Armand von Uffenbach referred to Vivaldi as &quot;the famous composer and violinist&quot; and said that &quot;Vivaldi played a solo accompaniment excellently, and at the conclusion he added a free fantasy [an improvised cadenza] which absolutely astounded me, for it is hardly possible that anyone has ever played, or ever will play, in such a fashion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Landon, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:8106 - Venezia - Calle della Pietà - Lapide Vivaldi - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto 8-Aug-2007.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Commemorative plaque beside the Ospedale della Pietà]]
Vivaldi was only 25 when he started working at the Ospedale della Pietà. Over the next thirty years he composed most of his major works while working there.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; There were four similar institutions in Venice; their purpose was to give shelter and education to children who were abandoned or orphaned, or whose families could not support them. They were financed by funds provided by the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Pincherle, ''Vivaldi: Genius of the Baroque'' (Paris: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 1957), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The boys learned a trade and had to leave when they reached 15. The girls received a musical education, and the most talented stayed and became members of the Ospedale's renowned orchestra and choir.

Shortly after Vivaldi's appointment, the orphans began to gain appreciation and esteem abroad, too. Vivaldi wrote concertos, cantatas and sacred vocal music for them.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; These sacred works, which number over 60, are varied: they included solo motets and large-scale choral works for soloists, double chorus, and orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; In 1704, the position of teacher of ''[[lyra viol|viola all'inglese]]'' was added to his duties as violin instructor.&lt;ref name=Landon26&gt;Landon, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The position of ''maestro di coro'', which was at one time filled by Vivaldi, required a lot of time and work. He had to compose an oratorio or concerto at every feast and teach the orphans both music theory and how to play certain instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Pincherle, ''Vivaldi: Genius of the Baroque'' (Paris: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 1957), 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

His relationship with the board of directors of the Ospedale was often strained. The board had to take a vote every year on whether to keep a teacher. The vote on Vivaldi was seldom unanimous, and went 7 to 6 against him in 1709.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd, 1978), 48.&lt;/ref&gt; After a year as a freelance musician, he was recalled by the Ospedale with a unanimous vote in 1711; clearly during his year's absence the board realized the importance of his role.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; He became responsible for all of the musical activity of the institution&lt;ref&gt;Heller, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; when he was promoted to ''maestro de' concerti'' (music director) in&lt;!-- Was he promoted in 1713 or 1716? Article apparently stated both --&gt; 1716.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd, 1978), 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1705, the first collection (''Connor Cassara'') of his works was published by Giuseppe Sala:&lt;ref&gt;Marc Pincherle, ''Vivaldi: Genius of the Baroque'' (Paris: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 1957), 38.&lt;/ref&gt; his Opus 1 is a collection of 12 [[sonata]]s for two violins and basso continuo, in a conventional style.&lt;ref name=Landon26 /&gt; In 1709, a second collection of 12 sonatas for violin and basso continuo appeared, his Opus 2.&lt;ref&gt;Landon, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; A real breakthrough as a composer came with his first collection of 12 concerti for one, two, and four violins with strings, ''[[L'estro Armonico|L'estro armonico]]'' Opus 3, which was published in [[Amsterdam]] in 1711 by [[Estienne Roger]],&lt;ref&gt;Landon, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated to [[Ferdinando (III) de' Medici|Grand Prince Ferdinand of Tuscany]]. The prince sponsored many musicians including [[Alessandro Scarlatti]] and [[George Frideric Handel]]. He was a musician himself, and Vivaldi probably met him in Venice.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd, 1978), 54.&lt;/ref&gt; ''L'estro armonico'' was a resounding success all over Europe. It was followed in 1714 by ''[[La stravaganza]]'' Opus 4, a collection of concerti for solo violin and strings,&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Talbot 1978&quot;&gt;Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd, 1978), 58.&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated to an old violin student of Vivaldi's, the Venetian noble Vettor Dolfin.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Talbot, Vivaldi (London: J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd, 1978), 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1711, Vivaldi and his father traveled to [[Brescia]], where his setting of the [[Stabat Mater]] ([[Stabat Mater (Vivaldi)|RV 621]]) was played as part of a religious festival. The work seems to have been written in haste: the string parts are simple, the music of the first three movements is repeated in the next three, and not all the text is set. Nevertheless, perhaps in part because of the forced essentiality of the music, the work is one of his early masterpieces.

Despite his frequent travels from 1718, the Pietà paid him 2 [[sequin (coin)|sequins]] to write two concerti a month for the orchestra and to rehearse with them at least five times when in Venice. The Pietà's records show that he was paid for 140 concerti between 1723 and 1733.

===Opera impresario===
[[File:Vivaldis first edition of Juditha triumphnas.jpg|thumb|upright|First edition of ''Juditha triumphans''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baroquemusic.org/bqxvivaldi.html &quot;Vivaldi's Venice&quot;], baroquemusic.org. &quot;As far as his theatrical activities were concerned, the end of 1716 was a high point for Vivaldi. In November, he managed to have the Ospedale della Pietà perform his first great oratorio, ''Juditha Triumphans devicta Holofernis barbaric''. {{sic}} This work was an allegorical description of the victory of the Venetians over the Turks in August 1716.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In early 18th-century Venice, opera was the most popular musical entertainment. It proved most profitable for Vivaldi. There were several theaters competing for the public's attention. Vivaldi started his career as an opera composer as a sideline: his first opera, ''[[Ottone in villa]]'' (RV 729) was performed not in Venice, but at the Garzerie Theater in [[Vicenza]] in 1713.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Vivaldi became the [[impresario]] of the [[Teatro San Angelo]] in Venice, where his opera ''[[Orlando finto pazzo]]'' (RV 727) was performed. The work was not to the public's taste, and it closed after a couple of weeks, being replaced with a repeat of a different work already given the previous year.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In 1715, he presented ''[[Nerone fatto Cesare]]'' (RV 724, now lost), with music by seven different composers, of which he was the leader. The opera contained eleven [[aria]]s, and was a success. In the late season, Vivaldi planned to put on an opera composed entirely by him, ''[[Arsilda, regina di Ponto]]'' (RV 700), but the state censor blocked the performance. The main character, Arsilda, falls in love with another woman, Lisea, who is pretending to be a man.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Vivaldi got the censor to accept the opera the following year, and it was a resounding success.

At this period, the ''Pietà'' commissioned several liturgical works. The most important were two [[oratorio]]s. ''Moyses Deus Pharaonis'', (RV 643) is lost. The second, ''[[Juditha triumphans]]'' (RV 644), celebrates the [[Siege of Corfu (1716)|victory of the Republic of Venice]] against the Turks and the recapture of the island of [[Corfu]]. Composed in 1716, it is one of his sacred masterpieces. All eleven singing parts were performed by girls of the Pietà, both the female and male roles. Many of the [[aria]]s include parts for solo instruments—recorders, oboes, violas d'amore, and mandolins—that showcased the range of talents of the girls.&lt;ref&gt;Landon, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1716, Vivaldi wrote and produced two more operas, ''[[L'incoronazione di Dario]]'' (RV 719) and ''La costanza trionfante degli amori e degli odi'' (RV 706). The latter was so popular that it performed two years later, re-edited and retitled ''Artabano re dei Parti'' (RV 701, now lost). It was also performed in Prague in 1732. In the following years, Vivaldi wrote several operas that were performed all over Italy.

[[File:Teatro alla moda.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece of ''Il teatro alla moda'']]
His progressive operatic style caused him some trouble with more conservative musicians, like [[Benedetto Marcello]], a magistrate and amateur musician who wrote a [[pamphlet]] denouncing him and his operas. The pamphlet, ''[[Il teatro alla moda]]'', attacks Vivaldi without mentioning him directly. The cover drawing shows a boat (the Sant'Angelo), on the left end of which stands a little angel wearing a priest's hat and playing the violin. The Marcello family claimed ownership of the Teatro Sant'Angelo, and a long legal battle had been fought with the management for its restitution, without success. The obscure writing under the picture mentions non-existent places and names: ''ALDIVIVA'' is an anagram of ''A. Vivaldi''.

In a letter written by Vivaldi to his patron Marchese Bentivoglio in 1737, he makes reference to his &quot;94 operas&quot;. Only around 50 operas by Vivaldi have been discovered, and no other documentation of the remaining operas exists. Although Vivaldi may have exaggerated, in his dual role of composer and ''impresario'' it is plausible that he may either have written or been responsible for the production of as many as 94 operas during a career which by then had spanned almost 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; While Vivaldi certainly composed many operas in his time, he never reached the prominence of other great composers like [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Johann Adolph Hasse]], [[Leonardo Leo]], and [[Baldassare Galuppi]], as evidenced by his inability to keep a production running for any extended period of time in any major opera house.&lt;ref name=Heller114&gt;Heller, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mantua and the'' Four Seasons''===
In 1717 or 1718, Vivaldi was offered a new prestigious position as ''Maestro di Cappella'' of the court of prince [[Philip of Hesse-Darmstadt]], governor of [[Mantua]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd, 1978), 64.&lt;/ref&gt; He moved there for three years and produced several operas, among which was ''[[Tito Manlio]]'' (RV 738). In 1721, he was in Milan, where he presented the pastoral drama ''[[La Silvia]]'' (RV 734, 9 arias survive). He visited Milan again the following year with the oratorio ''L'adorazione delli tre re magi al bambino Gesù'' (RV 645, also lost). In 1722 he moved to Rome, where he introduced his operas' new style. The new [[pope Benedict XIII]] invited Vivaldi to play for him. In 1725, Vivaldi returned to Venice, where he produced four operas in the same year.

[[File:Vivaldi caricature.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Caricature]] by P. L. Ghezzi, Rome (1723)&lt;ref&gt;There are only three known surviving depictions of Vivaldi made in his lifetime: this caricature, the woodcut at the beginning of this article, and an oil portrait of the composer and his violin. ''Groves Dictionary of Music and Musicians'' has disputed the authenticity of the last portrait.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During this period Vivaldi wrote the ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|Four Seasons]]'', four violin concertos depicting scenes appropriate for each season. Three of the concerti are of original conception, while the first, &quot;Spring&quot;, borrows motifs from a Sinfonia in the first act of his contemporaneous opera ''Il Giustino''. The inspiration for the concertos was probably the countryside around Mantua. They were a revolution in musical conception: in them Vivaldi represented flowing creeks, singing birds (of different species, each specifically characterized), barking dogs, buzzing mosquitoes, crying shepherds, storms, drunken dancers, silent nights, hunting parties from both the hunters' and the prey's point of view, frozen landscapes, ice-skating children, and warming winter fires. Each concerto is associated with a [[sonnet]], possibly by Vivaldi, describing the scenes depicted in the music. They were published as the first four concertos in a collection of twelve, ''[[Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione]]'', Opus 8, published in Amsterdam by [[Michel-Charles Le Cène]] in 1725.

During his time in Mantua, Vivaldi became acquainted with an aspiring young singer [[Anna Girò|Anna Tessieri Girò]] who was to become his student, protégée, and favorite prima donna.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J. M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd, 1978), 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Anna, along with her older half-sister Paolina, became part of Vivaldi's entourage and regularly accompanied him on his many travels. There was speculation about the nature of Vivaldi's and Giro's relationship, but no evidence to indicate anything beyond friendship and professional collaboration. Although Vivaldi's relationship with Anna Girò was questioned, he adamantly denied any romantic relationship in a letter to his patron Bentivoglio dated 16 November 1737.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd, 1978), 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life and death===
At the height of his career, Vivaldi received commissions from European nobility and royalty. The ''serenata'' (cantata) ''Gloria e Imeneo'' (RV 687) was commissioned in 1725 by the French [[ambassador]] to Venice in celebration of the marriage of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]. The following year, another ''serenata'', ''La Sena festeggiante'' (RV 694), was written for and premiered at the French embassy as well, celebrating the birth of the French royal princesses, [[Princess Henriette of France|Henriette]] and [[Louise Élisabeth of France|Louise Élisabeth]]. Vivaldi's Opus 9, ''[[La Cetra (Vivaldi)|La Cetra]]'', was dedicated to [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]]. In 1728, Vivaldi met the emperor while the emperor was visiting [[Trieste]] to oversee the construction of a new port. Charles admired the music of the Red Priest so much that he is said to have spoken more with the composer during their one meeting than he spoke to his ministers in over two years. He gave Vivaldi the title of [[knight]], a gold medal and an invitation to Vienna. Vivaldi gave Charles a manuscript copy of ''La Cetra'', a set of concerti almost completely different from the set of the same title published as Opus 9. The printing was probably delayed, forcing Vivaldi to gather an improvised collection for the emperor.

Accompanied by his father, Vivaldi traveled to Vienna and Prague in 1730, where his opera ''[[Farnace]]'' (RV 711) was presented.&lt;ref&gt;Vivaldi's connections with musical life in Prague and his association with [[Antonio Denzio]], the impresario of the [[Franz Anton von Sporck|Sporck theater in Prague]] are detailed in Daniel E. Freeman, ''The Opera Theater of Count Franz Anton von Sporck in Prague'' (Stuyvesant, N.Y.: Pendragon Press, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Farnace'' garnered six revivals later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heller114&quot; /&gt; Some of his later operas were created in collaboration with two of Italy's major writers of the time. ''[[L'Olimpiade]]'' and ''[[Catone in Utica]]'' were written by [[Pietro Metastasio]], the major representative of the [[Academy of Arcadia|Arcadian]] movement and court poet in Vienna. ''[[Griselda (Vivaldi)|La Griselda]]'' was rewritten by the young [[Carlo Goldoni]] from an earlier libretto by [[Apostolo Zeno]].

Like many composers of the time, the final years of Vivaldi's life found him in financial difficulties. His compositions were no longer held in such high esteem as they once were in Venice; changing musical tastes quickly made them outmoded. In response, Vivaldi chose to sell off sizeable numbers of his manuscripts at paltry prices to finance his migration to [[Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kolneder, ''Antonio Vivaldi: Documents of his life and works'' (Amsterdam: Heinrichshofen's Verlag, Wilhelmshaven, Locarno, 1982), 179.&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for Vivaldi's departure from Venice are unclear, but it seems likely that, after the success of his meeting with Emperor Charles VI, he wished to take up the position of a composer in the imperial court. On his way to Vienna, Vivaldi may have stopped in Graz to see Anna Girò.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kolneder, ''Antonio Vivaldi: Documents of his life and works'' (Amsterdam: Heinrichshofen's Verlag, Wilhelmshaven, Locarno, 1982), 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also likely that Vivaldi went to Vienna to stage operas, especially as he took up residence near the [[Kärntnertortheater]]. Shortly after his arrival in Vienna, Charles VI died, which left the composer without any royal protection or a steady source of income. Soon afterwards, Vivaldi became impoverished&lt;ref&gt;Landon supplies this assertion and furthermore quotes the report of Vivaldi's death which reached Venice in the ''Commemorali Gradenigo'': &quot;Abbe Lord Antonio Vivaldi, incomparable virtuoso of the violin, known as the Red Priest, much esteemed for his compositions and concertos, who earned more than 50,000 ducats in his life, but his disorderly prodigality caused him to die a pauper in Vienna.&quot; Landon, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marc Pincherle, ''Vivaldi: Genius of the Baroque'' (Paris: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 1957), 53.&lt;/ref&gt; and died during the night of 27/28 July 1741, aged 63,&lt;ref&gt;Talbot (p. 69) gives the 27th as the day of death. Formichetti (p. 194) reports that he died during the night and his death was the first registered on the next day. Heller (p. 263) states: &quot;The composer's death is noted in the official coroner's report and in the burial account book of St. Stephen's Cathedral Parish as having occurred on 28 July 1741&quot;. But the so-called ''Totenbeschauprotokoll'' is not a reliable source, since the date can refer to when the entry was made, not to the actual time of death.&lt;/ref&gt; of &quot;internal infection&quot;, in a house owned by the widow of a Viennese saddlemaker. On 28 July he was buried in a simple grave in a burial ground that was owned by the public hospital fund. Vivaldi's funeral took place at [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]], but the young [[Joseph Haydn]] had nothing to do with this burial, since no music was performed on that occasion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Lorenz (musicologist)|Michael Lorenz]], [http://michaelorenz.blogspot.co.at/2014/06/haydn-singing-at-vivaldis-exequies.html &quot;Haydn Singing at Vivaldi's Exequies: An Ineradicable Myth&quot;] (Vienna 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of his funeral with a 'Kleingeläut' was 19 Gulden 45 Kreuzer which was rather expensive for the lowest class of peal of bells.

He was buried next to [[Karlskirche]], in an area which is now part of the site of the [[Vienna University of Technology|Technical Institute]]. The house where he lived in Vienna has since been destroyed; the [[Hotel Sacher]] is built on part of the site. Memorial plaques have been placed at both locations, as well as a Vivaldi &quot;star&quot; in the Viennese Musikmeile and a monument at the Rooseveltplatz.

Only two, possibly three original portraits of Vivaldi are known to survive: an engraving, an ink sketch and an oil painting. The engraving, which was the basis of several copies produced at some later time by other artists, was made in 1725 by François Morellon La Cave for the first edition of ''[[Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione]]'', and shows Vivaldi holding a sheet of music.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Talbot, ''The Vivaldi Compendium'' (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2011), 147-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The ink sketch, a [[caricature]], was done by [[Pier Leone Ghezzi|Ghezzi]] in 1723 and shows Vivaldi's head and shoulders in profile. It exists in two versions: a first jotting kept at the [[Vatican Library]], and a much lesser-known, slightly more detailed copy recently discovered in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Talbot, ''The Vivaldi Compendium'' (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2011), 87.&lt;/ref&gt; The oil painting, which can be seen in the [[International Museum and Library of Music of Bologna]], is anonymous, and is thought to be of Vivaldi due to its strong resemblance with the La Cave engraving.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Talbot, ''The Vivaldi Compendium'' (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2011), 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vivaldi's music was innovative. He brightened the formal and rhythmic structure of the concerto, in which he looked for harmonic contrasts and innovative melodies and themes; many of his compositions are flamboyantly, almost playfully, exuberant.&lt;!-- some compositions before Vivaldi were flamboyantly and playfully exuberant, what does this tell us? --&gt;

[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] was deeply influenced by Vivaldi's concertos and arias (recalled in his ''[[St John Passion]]'', ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'', and [[Bach cantata|cantatas]]). Bach transcribed six of Vivaldi's concerti for solo keyboard, three for organ, and one for four harpsichords, strings, and [[Figured bass|basso continuo]] (BWV 1065) based upon the concerto for four violins, two violas, cello, and basso continuo ([[Ryom-Verzeichnis|RV]] 580).

==Posthumous reputation==
During his lifetime, Vivaldi was popular in many countries, including France, but after his death the composer's popularity dwindled. After the Baroque period, Vivaldi's published concerti became relatively unknown and were largely ignored. Even Vivaldi's most famous work, ''The Four Seasons'', was unknown in its original edition during the [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] periods.

During the early 20th century, [[Fritz Kreisler]]'s Concerto in C, in the Style of Vivaldi (which he passed off as an original Vivaldi work) helped revive Vivaldi's reputation. This spurred the French scholar [[Marc Pincherle]] to begin an academic study of Vivaldi's oeuvre. Many Vivaldi manuscripts were rediscovered, which were acquired by the [[Turin National University Library]] as a result of the generous sponsorship of [[Turin]]ese businessmen Roberto Foa and Filippo Giordano, in memory of their sons. This led to a renewed interest in Vivaldi by, among others, Mario Rinaldi, [[Alfredo Casella]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Olga Rudge]], [[Desmond Chute]], [[Arturo Toscanini]], [[Arnold Schering]] and [[Louis Kaufman]], all of whom were instrumental in the Vivaldi revival of the 20th century.

In 1926, in a monastery in [[Piedmont]], researchers discovered fourteen folios of Vivaldi's work that were previously thought to have been lost during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Some missing volumes in the numbered set were discovered in the collections of the descendants of the Grand Duke Durazzo, who had acquired the monastery complex in the 18th century. The volumes contained 300 concertos, 19 operas and over 100 vocal-instrumental works.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Vivaldi biography by Alexander Kuznetsov and Louise Thomas, a booklet attached to the CD &quot;The best of Vivaldi&quot;, published and recorded by Madacy Entertainment Group Inc, St. Laurent Quebec Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

The resurrection of Vivaldi's unpublished works in the 20th century is mostly due to the efforts of [[Alfredo Casella]], who in 1939 organized the historic Vivaldi Week, in which the rediscovered [[Gloria (Vivaldi)|Gloria]] (RV 589) and l'Olimpiade were revived. Since [[World War II]], Vivaldi's compositions have enjoyed wide success. [[Historically informed performance]]s, often on &quot;original instruments&quot;, have increased Vivaldi's fame still further.

Recent rediscoveries of works by Vivaldi include two [[psalm]] settings of ''Nisi Dominus'' (RV 803, in eight movements) and ''Dixit Dominus'' (RV 807, in eleven movements). These were identified in 2003 and 2005 respectively, by the Australian scholar Janice Stockigt. The Vivaldi scholar [[Michael Talbot (musicologist)|Michael Talbot]] described RV 807 as &quot;arguably the best nonoperatic work from Vivaldi's pen to come to light since... ...the 1920s&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Talbot, liner notes to the CD ''Vivaldi: Dixit Dominus'', Körnerscher Sing-Verein Dresden (Dresdner Instrumental-Concert), Peter Kopp, [[Deutsche Grammophon]] 2006, catalogue number 4776145&lt;/ref&gt; Vivaldi's lost 1730 opera ''[[Argippo]]'' (RV 697) was rediscovered in 2006 by the [[harpsichordist]] and conductor Ondřej Macek, whose Hofmusici orchestra performed the work at [[Prague Castle]] on 3 May 2008, its first performance since 1730.

==Works==
{{Main|List of compositions by Antonio Vivaldi|List of operas by Vivaldi}}

A composition by Vivaldi is identified by [[Ryom-Verzeichnis|RV number]], which refers to its place in the &quot;Ryom-Verzeichnis&quot; or &quot;Répertoire des oeuvres d'Antonio Vivaldi&quot;, a catalog created in the 20th century by the musicologist [[Peter Ryom]].

[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|''Le quattro stagioni'' (The Four Seasons)]] of 1723 is his most famous work. Part of ''[[Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione]]'' (&quot;The Contest between Harmony and Invention&quot;), it depicts moods and scenes from each of the four seasons. This work has been described as an outstanding instance of pre-19th century [[program music]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Schwarz, ''Musically Speaking – The Great Works Collection: Vivaldi'' (CVP, Inc., 1995), 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vivaldi wrote more than 500 other concertos. About 350 of these are for solo instrument and strings, of which 230 are for violin, the others being for [[bassoon]], [[cello]], [[oboe]], [[flute]], [[viola d'amore]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], [[lute]], or [[mandolin]]. About forty concertos are for two instruments and strings and about thirty are for three or more instruments and strings.

As well as about 46 operas, Vivaldi composed a large body of sacred choral music. Other works include [[sinfonia]]s, about 90 [[sonata]]s and chamber music.

Some sonatas for flute, published as ''Il Pastor Fido'', have been erroneously attributed to Vivaldi, but were composed by [[Nicolas Chédeville]].

==Catalogs of Vivaldi works==
Vivaldi's works attracted cataloging efforts befitting a major composer. Scholarly work intended to increase the accuracy and variety of Vivaldi performances also supported new discoveries which made old catalogs incomplete. Works still in circulation today may be numbered under several different systems (some earlier catalogs are mentioned [[Ryom-Verzeichnis|here]]).

Because the simply consecutive Complete Edition (CE) numbers did not reflect the individual works (Opus numbers) into which compositions were grouped, Fanna numbers were often used in conjunction with CE numbers. Combined Complete Edition (CE)/Fanna numbering was especially common in the work of Italian groups driving the mid-20th century revival of Vivaldi, such as Gli Accademici di Milano under Piero Santi. For example, the Bassoon Concerto in B{{music|flat}} major, &quot;La Notte&quot; RV 501, became CE 12, F. VIII,1

Despite the awkwardness of having to overlay Fanna numbers onto the Complete Edition number for meaningful grouping of Vivaldi's oeuvre, these numbers displaced the older [[Marc Pincherle|Pincherle]] numbers as the (re-)discovery of more manuscripts had rendered older catalogs obsolete.

This cataloging work was led by the Istituto Italiano Antonio Vivaldi, where [[Gian Francesco Malipiero]] was both the Director and the editor of the published scores (Edizioni G. Ricordi). His work built on that of Antonio Fanna, a Venetian businessman and the Institute's founder, and thus formed a bridge to the scholarly catalog dominant today.

Compositions by Vivaldi are identified today by [[Ryom-Verzeichnis|RV number]], the number assigned by Danish musicologist [[Peter Ryom]] in works published mostly in the 1970s, such as the &quot;Ryom-Verzeichnis&quot; or &quot;Répertoire des oeuvres d'Antonio Vivaldi&quot;. Like the Complete Edition before it, the RV does not typically assign its single, consecutive numbers to &quot;adjacent&quot; works that occupy one of the composer's single opus numbers. Its goal as a modern catalog is to index the manuscripts and sources that establish the existence and nature of all known works. These several numbering systems are cross-referenced at [http://www.classical.net/music/composer/works/vivaldi/index.php classical.net].

==In popular culture==
The movie ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Vivaldi, a Prince in Venice|fr|Antonio Vivaldi, un prince à Venise}}'' was completed in 2005 as an Italian-French co-production under the direction of {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Louis Guillermou|fr}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|tt0463283|Antonio Vivaldi, un prince à Venise}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] [[Radio National]] commissioned a [[radio play]] about Vivaldi, which was written by [[Sean Riley (playwright)|Sean Riley]]. Entitled ''The Angel and the Red Priest'', the play was later adapted for the stage and was performed at the [[Adelaide Festival of the Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angel and the Red Priest by Sean Riley|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/airplay/stories/2011/3244574.htm|work=Airplay|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] [[Radio National]]|accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Janice Jordan Shefelman]] wrote a children's book detailing the life of Vivaldi entitled ''I, Vivaldi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bush|first=Elizabeth|title=I, Vivaldi (review)|publisher=Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical Kids Music Education produces live theatre productions, and has issued a CD entitled Vivaldi's Ring of Mystery &lt;ref&gt;{{cite |title=Vivaldi's Ring of Mystery | url=http://www.classicalkidsnfp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; an original fictional story about an orphan girl in the early 1700s who is in search of her roots. A central clue to the mystery is a missing Stradivarius violin that the Duke of Cremona has brought to Vivaldi’s school of the Pieta in the hopes of finding his long lost grandchild. Vivaldi music is featured throughout the story to support the narrative.

==History==
{{Main article|History of Berlin|Timeline of Berlin}}

===Etymology===
The name Berlin has its roots in the language of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and may be related to the Old [[Polabian language|Polabian]] stem ''berl-''/''birl-'' (&quot;swamp&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Berger|first=Dieter|title=Geographische Namen in Deutschland|publisher=Bibliographisches Institut|year=1999|isbn=3-411-06252-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; All German place names ending on ''-ow'', ''-itz'' and ''-in'', of which there are many east of the [[Elbe|River Elbe]], are of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] origin ([[Germania Slavica]]). There are many boroughs of Slavic origin in the city: Berlin-[[Karow (Berlin)|Karow]], Berlin-[[Malchow (Berlin)|Malchow]], Berlin-[[Pankow]], Berlin-[[Spandau]] (earlier: ''Spandow''), Berlin-[[Gatow]], Berlin-[[Kladow]], Berlin-[[Steglitz]], Berlin-[[Lankwitz]], Berlin-[[Britz]], Berlin-[[Buckow (Berlin)|Buckow]], Berlin-[[Rudow]], Berlin-[[Alt-Treptow]], Berlin-[[Schmöckwitz]], Berlin-[[Marzahn]] and Berlin-[[Köpenick]]. Since the ''Ber-'' at the beginning sounds like the German word ''Bär'' (bear), there appears a bear in the coat of arms of the city. It is therefore a [[canting arms|canting arm]].

===12th to 16th centuries===
[[File:ZLB-Berliner Ansichten-Januar.jpg|thumb|Map of Berlin in 1688]]

The earliest evidence of settlements in the area of today's Berlin are a wooden rod dated from approximately 1192&lt;ref name=&quot;zycwaq&quot;&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |title=Berlin dig finds city older than thought|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and leftovers of wooden houseparts dated to 1174 found in a 2012 excavation in Berlin Mitte.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |agency=dpa |title=Berlin ist älter als gedacht: Hausreste aus dem Jahr 1174 entdeckt|accessdate=24 August 2012|url=http://www.berlin.de/aktuelles/berlin/2674414-958092-berlin-ist-aelter-als-gedacht-hausreste-.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first written records of towns in the area of present-day Berlin date from the late 12th century. [[Spandau]] is first mentioned in 1197 and [[Köpenick]] in 1209, although these areas did not join Berlin until 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin.de/tourismus/sehenswuerdigkeiten.en/00175.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612020333/http://www.berlin.de/tourismus/sehenswuerdigkeiten.en/00175.html|archivedate=12 June 2008|title=Spandau Citadel|work=Berlin tourist board|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central part of Berlin can be traced back to two towns. [[Cölln]] on the [[Fischerinsel]] is first mentioned in a 1237 document, and Berlin, across the [[Spree]] in what is now called the [[Nikolaiviertel]], is referenced in a document from 1244.&lt;ref name=&quot;zycwaq&quot;/&gt; 1237 is considered the founding date of the city.&lt;ref name=Medtradc&gt;{{cite web|title=The medieval trading center|url=http://www.berlin.de/berlin-im-ueberblick/geschichte/handelsstadt.en.html|accessdate=11 June 2013|location=www.berlin.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two towns over time formed close economic and social ties, and profited from the [[staple right]] on the two important [[trade route]]s ''[[Via Imperii]]'' and from [[Bruges]] to [[Novgorod]].&lt;ref name=&quot;staple&quot;/&gt; In 1307, they formed an alliance with a common external policy, their internal administrations still being separated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stöver2010&quot;&gt;Stöver B.

In 1415 [[Frederick I, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick I]] became the [[prince-elector|elector]] of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], which he ruled until 1440.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.west.net/~antipas/protected_files/news/europe/hohenzollerns.html|title=The Hohenzollern Dynasty|work=Antipas|accessdate=18 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807093738/http://www.west.net/~antipas/protected_files/news/europe/hohenzollerns.html |archivedate=7 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 15th century, his successors established Berlin-Cölln as capital of the margraviate, and subsequent members of the [[Hohenzollern]] family ruled in Berlin until 1918, first as electors of Brandenburg, then as kings of Prussia, and eventually as [[German emperor]]s. In 1443 [[Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick II Irontooth]] started the construction of a new [[Stadtschloss, Berlin|royal palace]] in the twin city Berlin-Cölln. The protests of the town citizens against the building culminated in 1448, in the &quot;Berlin Indignation&quot; (&quot;Berliner Unwille&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diegeschichteberlins.de/geschichteberlins/berlinabc/stichworteag/555-berliner-unwillen.html Berliner Unwillen].

Since 1618 the Margraviate of Brandenburg had been in [[personal union]] with the [[Duchy of Prussia]]. In 1701 the dual state formed the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], as [[Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg]] crowned himself as king [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I in Prussia]]. Berlin became the capital of the new Kingdom. This was a successful attempt to centralise the capital in the very far-flung state, and it was the first time the city began to grow. In 1709, Berlin merged with the four cities of Cölln, Friedrichswerder, Friedrichstadt and Dorotheenstadt under the name Berlin, &quot;Haupt- und Residenzstadt Berlin&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stöver2010&quot;/&gt;

The [[Industrial Revolution]] transformed Berlin during the 19th century; the city's economy and population expanded dramatically, and it became the main railway hub and economic centre of Germany.

In the early 20th century, Berlin had become a fertile ground for the [[German Expressionism|German Expressionist]] movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;HollandGawthrop2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jack Holland|author2=John Gawthrop|title=The Rough Guide to Berlin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-EsJWmKCSa8C&amp;pg=PA361|year=2001|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-85828-682-2|page=361}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fields such as [[architecture]], [[painting]] and [[film|cinema]] new forms of artistic styles were invented. At the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918, a [[Weimar Republic|republic]] was proclaimed by [[Philipp Scheidemann]] at the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]]. In 1920 the [[Greater Berlin Act]] incorporated dozens of suburban cities, villages and estates around Berlin into an expanded city. The act increased the area of Berlin from {{convert|66|to|883|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The population almost doubled and Berlin had a population of around four million. During the [[Weimar culture|Weimar era]], Berlin underwent political unrest due to economic uncertainties, but also became a renowned centre of the [[Roaring Twenties]]. The metropolis experienced its heyday as a major world capital and was known for its leadership roles in science, technology, arts, the humanities, city planning, film, higher education, government and industries. [[Albert Einstein]] rose to public prominence during his years in Berlin, being awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1921.

In 1933 [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] [[Nazi seizure of power|came to power]]. NSDAP rule diminished Berlin's Jewish community from 160,000 (one-third of all Jews in the country) to about 80,000 as a result of emigration between 1933 and 1939. After [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, thousands of the city's Jews were imprisoned in the nearby [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]. Starting in early 1943, many were shipped to [[death camp]]s, such as [[Auschwitz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005450|title=Berlin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, large parts of Berlin were destroyed in [[Battle of Berlin (air)|the 1943–45 air raids]] and during the [[Battle of Berlin]].

The victorious powers divided the city into four sectors, analogous to the [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation zones]] into which Germany was divided. The sectors of the [[Western Allies]] (the United States, the United Kingdom and France) formed [[West Berlin]], while the [[Soviet Union|Soviet sector]] formed [[East Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/t297c01.html|title=Agreement to divide Berlin|work=FDR-Library|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Berlinermauer.jpg|thumb|The [[Berlin Wall]] (painted on the western side) was a barrier that divided the city from 1961 to 1989.]]

All four [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] shared administrative responsibilities for Berlin. However, in 1948, when the Western Allies extended the currency reform in the Western zones of Germany to the three western sectors of Berlin, the [[Soviet Union]] imposed a [[Berlin Blockade|blockade]] on the access routes to and from West Berlin, which lay entirely inside Soviet-controlled territory. The [[Berlin airlift]], conducted by the three western Allies, overcame this blockade by supplying food and other supplies to the city from June 1948 to May 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.western-allies-berlin.com/historic-events/detail/airlift-blockade|title=Berlin Airlift / Blockade|publisher=Western Allies Berlin|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in [[West Germany]] and eventually included all of the American, British and French zones, excluding those three countries' zones in Berlin, while the [[Marxist-Leninist]] [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] was proclaimed in East Germany. West Berlin officially remained an occupied city, but it politically was aligned with the Federal Republic of Germany despite West Berlin's geographic isolation. Airline service to West Berlin was granted only to American, British and French airlines.

The founding of the two German states increased [[Cold War]] tensions. West Berlin was surrounded by East German territory, and East Germany proclaimed the Eastern part as its capital, a move that was not recognised by the western powers. East Berlin included most of the historic centre of the city. The West German government established itself in [[Bonn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin.de/berlin-im-ueberblick/geschichte/1945.en.html|title=Berlin official website; History after 1945|publisher=City of Berlin|accessdate=8 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 East Germany began the building of the [[Berlin Wall]] between East and West Berlin, and events escalated to a tank standoff at [[Checkpoint Charlie]]. West Berlin was now de facto a part of West Germany with a unique legal status, while East Berlin was de facto a part of East Germany. [[John F. Kennedy]] gave his &quot;''[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]''&quot;{{snd}} speech in 1963 underlining the US support for the Western part of the city. Berlin was completely divided. Although it was possible for Westerners to pass from one to the other side through strictly controlled checkpoints, for most Easterners travel to West Berlin or West Germany was prohibited by the government of East Germany. In 1971, a [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin|Four-Power agreement]] guaranteed access to and from West Berlin by car or train through East Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/ga5-710903.htm|title=Ostpolitik: The Quadripartite Agreement of September 3, 1971|publisher=US Berlin Embassy|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, with the end of the Cold War and pressure from the East German population, the Berlin Wall fell on 9 November and was subsequently mostly demolished. Today, the [[East Side Gallery]] preserves a large portion of the wall. On 3 October 1990, the two parts of Germany were [[German reunification|reunified]] as the Federal Republic of Germany and Berlin again became the official German capital. In 1991, the German Parliament, the [[Bundestag]], [[Decision on the Capital of Germany|voted to move the seat]] of the German capital from Bonn to Berlin, which was completed in 1999. On 18 June 1994 soldiers from the United States, France and Britain marched in a parade which was part of the ceremonies to mark the final withdrawal of foreign troops allowing a [[German reunification#Reunified Berlin|reunified Berlin]].&lt;ref name=ReUnificationParade&gt;{{cite news | last = Kinzer | first = Stephan | title = Allied Soldiers March to Say Farewell to Berlin | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/19/world/allied-soldiers-march-to-say-farewell-to-berlin.html | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | location = New York City | date = 19 June 1994 | accessdate = 20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Berlin's 2001 administrative reform]] merged several districts. The number of boroughs was reduced from 23 to 12. In 2006, the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final|FIFA World Cup Final]] was held in Berlin.

===Topography===
[[File:Visit-suomi-2009-05-by-RalfR-014.jpg|thumb|Aerial view over Berlin Mitte]]

Berlin is situated in northeastern [[Germany]], in an area of low-lying marshy woodlands with a mainly flat [[topography]], part of the vast [[Northern European Plain]] which stretches all the way from northern [[France]] to western [[Russia]]. The ''Berliner Urstromtal'' (an ice age [[glacial valley]]), between the low [[Barnim Plateau]] to the north and the [[Teltow plateau|Teltow Plateau]] to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last [[Weichselian glaciation]]. The [[Spree]] follows this valley now. In Spandau, a borough in the west of Berlin, the Spree empties into the river [[Havel]], which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and the [[Großer Wannsee]]. A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the [[Müggelsee|Großer Müggelsee]] in eastern Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=52.5333,13.38000&amp;spn=0.060339,0.085316&amp;t=k&amp;hl=en|title=Satellite Image Berlin|publisher=[[Google Maps]]|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Substantial parts of present-day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs [[Reinickendorf]] and [[Pankow]] lie on the Barnim Plateau, while most of the boroughs of [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]], [[Steglitz-Zehlendorf]], [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]], and [[Neukölln]] lie on the Teltow Plateau.

The borough of Spandau lies partly within the Berlin Glacial Valley and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the west of Berlin. Since 2015, the highest elevation in Berlin is found on the Arkenberge hills in Pankow, at {{convert|122|m|ft|abbr=off}}. Through the dumping of construction debris, they surpassed [[Teufelsberg]] ({{convert|120.1|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), a [[Schuttberg|hill made of rubble]] from the ruins of the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qiez.de/pankow/wohnen-und-leben/gruenes-berlin/der-hoechste-berg-von-berlin-liegt-nun-in-pankow-arkenberge/169588800 Berlin hat eine neue Spitze], Qiez, 27 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The highest natural elevation is found on the [[Müggelberge]] at {{convert|114.7|m|ft|abbr=off}}, and the lowest at the Spektesee in Spandau, at {{convert|28.1|m|ft|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Jacobs: [http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/bezirke/pankow/das-ist-die-hoehe-arkenberge-der-hoechste-berg-von-berlin-ist-neuerdings-in-pankow/11406254.html Der höchste Berg von Berlin ist neuerdings in Pankow], 22 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
[[File:Luftbild bln-schmoeckwitz.jpg|thumb|The outskirts of Berlin are covered with woodlands and numerous lakes.]]

Berlin has a [[Maritime temperate climate]] (''Cfb'') according to the [[Köppen climate classification]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=58301&amp;cityname=Berlin%2C+Berlin%2C+Germany&amp;units=|title=Berlin, Germany Climate Summary|publisher=Weatherbase|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are significant influences of mild continental climate due to its inland position, with frosts being common in winter and there being larger temperature differences between seasons than typical for many oceanic climates. Furthermore, Berlin is classified as a [[temperate]] [[humid continental|continental climate]] (''Dc'') under the [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha climate scheme]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerstengarbe FW, Werner PC (2009) A short update on Koeppen climate shifts in Europe between 1901 and 2003. Clim Change 92: 99–107&lt;/ref&gt;

Summers are warm and sometimes humid with average high temperatures of {{convert|22|–|25|C|F}} and lows of {{convert|12|–|14|C|F}}. Winters are cool with average high temperatures of {{convert|3|C|F}} and lows of {{convert|−2|to|0|C|F}}. Spring and autumn are generally chilly to mild. Berlin's built-up area creates a microclimate, with [[urban heat island|heat stored by the city's buildings and pavement]]. Temperatures can be {{convert|4|C-change|sigfig=1}} higher in the city than in the surrounding areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/ |title=weather.com |publisher=weather.com |accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual precipitation is {{convert|570|mm|in|sp=us}} with moderate rainfall throughout the year.

===Cityscape===
[[File:Berlin city skyline philipp von ostau.jpg|thumb|The cityscape of Berlin.]]

Berlin's history has left the city with a highly eclectic array of architecture and buildings. The city's appearance today is predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history in the 20th century. Each of the national governments based in Berlin{{snd}} the Kingdom of Prussia, the 1871 German Empire, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, and now the reunified Germany{{snd}} initiated ambitious reconstruction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture.

Berlin was devastated by [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|bombing raids]], fires and street battles during World War II, and many of the buildings that had remained after the war were demolished in the post-war period in both West and East Berlin. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new residential or business quarters and main roads. Many [[Ornament (art)|ornaments]] of pre-war buildings were destroyed following [[Ornament and Crime|modernist dogmas]]. While in both systems and in reunified Berlin, various important heritage monuments were also (partly) [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstructed]], including the ''Forum Fridericianum'' with e.g., the [[Berlin State Opera|State Opera]] (1955), [[Charlottenburg Palace]] (1957), the main monuments of the [[Gendarmenmarkt]] (1980s), [[Alte Kommandantur|Kommandantur]] (2003) and the project to reconstruct the baroque façades of the [[City Palace, Berlin|City Palace]]. A number of new buildings is inspired by historical predecessors or the general classical style of Berlin, such as [[Hotel Adlon]].

Clusters of [[List of tallest buildings in Berlin|high-rise buildings]] emerge at e.g., [[Potsdamer Platz]], [[City West]] and [[Alexanderplatz]]. Berlin has three of the top 40 [[List of tallest buildings in Germany|tallest buildings]] in Germany.

The [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] (TV tower) at [[Alexanderplatz]] in [[Mitte]] is among the tallest structures in the European Union at {{convert|368|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its {{convert|204|m|ft|abbr=on}} high observation floor. Starting here the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the [[Socialist Classicism]] style. Adjacent to this area is the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the [[Neptunbrunnen]], a fountain featuring a mythological group of [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]], [[Anthropomorphism|personifications]] of the four main Prussian rivers and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] on top of it.

[[File:Brandenburger Tor morgens.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Brandenburg Gate]] ]]

The [[Brandenburg Gate]] is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany; it stands as a symbol of eventful European history and of unity and peace. The [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]] is the traditional seat of the German Parliament. It was remodelled by British architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.

The [[East Side Gallery]] is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.

The [[Gendarmenmarkt]] is a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] square in Berlin, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century. It is bordered by two similarly designed cathedrals, the [[Französischer Dom]] with its observation platform and the [[Deutscher Dom]]. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.

[[File:Haus der Weltkulturen.jpg|thumb|[[Haus der Kulturen der Welt]] ]]

The [[Museum Island]] in the [[River Spree]] houses [[Berlin#Museums|five museums]] built from 1830 to 1930 and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Restoration and the construction of a main entrance to all museums, as well as the reconstruction of the [[Stadtschloss, Berlin|Stadtschloss]] is continuing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/newsticker/neumann--stadtschloss-wird-teurer,10917074,10924086.html |title=Neumann: Stadtschloss wird teurer|work= Berliner Zeitung |language=de |date=24 June 2011 |accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/die-nullerjahre--nation-building---der-wiedervereinigte-staat-baut-sich-eine-neue-hauptstadt-das-pathos-der-berliner-republik,10810590,10717494.html |title=Das Pathos der Berliner Republik|work= Berliner Zeitung |language=de |date=19 May 2010 |accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also located on the island and adjacent to the [[Lustgarten]] and palace is [[Berlin Cathedral]], emperor William II's ambitious attempt to create a Protestant counterpart to [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome. A large crypt houses the remains of some of the earlier Prussian royal family. [[St. Hedwig's Cathedral]] is Berlin's Roman Catholic cathedral.

[[File:17 20 pm (570903628).jpg|thumb|left|Potsdamer Platz, Kollhoff Tower at the center.]]

[[Unter den Linden]] is a tree-lined east–west avenue from the Brandenburg Gate to the site of the former Berliner Stadtschloss, and was once Berlin's premier promenade. Many Classical buildings line the street and part of [[Humboldt University]] is located there. [[Friedrichstraße]] was Berlin's legendary street during the [[Golden Twenties]]. It combines 20th-century traditions with the modern architecture of today's Berlin.

[[Potsdamer Platz]] is an entire quarter built from scratch after 1995 after the [[Berlin Wall|Wall]] came down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/bauen/baubilanz/en/potsdamer_platz.html |title=Construction and redevelopment since 1990 |publisher=Senate Department of Urban Development |accessdate=18 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610103008/http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/bauen/baubilanz/en/potsdamer_platz.html |archivedate=10 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To the west of Potsdamer Platz is the Kulturforum, which houses the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Gemäldegalerie]], and is flanked by the [[Neue Nationalgalerie]] and the [[Berliner Philharmonie]]. The [[Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe]], a [[Holocaust]] memorial, is situated to the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://travel2.nytimes.com/2005/05/09/arts/design/09holo.html?ex=1162962000&amp;en=272335914d8b80d6&amp;ei=5070 |title=A Forest of Pillars, Recalling the Unimaginable |work=The New York Times |accessdate=18 August 2008 |first=Nicolai |last=Ouroussoff |date=9 May 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205123448/http://travel2.nytimes.com/2005/05/09/arts/design/09holo.html?ex=1162962000&amp;en=272335914d8b80d6&amp;ei=5070 |archivedate=5 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area around [[Hackescher Markt]] is home to fashionable culture, with countless clothing outlets, clubs, bars, and galleries. This includes the [[Hackesche Höfe]], a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby [[New Synagogue, Berlin|New Synagogue]] is the center of Jewish culture.

[[File:Le château de Charlottenburg (Berlin) (6340508573).jpg|thumb|[[Schloss Charlottenburg]] is the largest existing palace in Berlin.]]

The [[Straße des 17. Juni]], connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central east-west axis. Its name commemorates the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953]]. Approximately halfway from the Brandenburg Gate is the Großer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the [[Siegessäule]] (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated in 1938–39 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.

The [[Kurfürstendamm]] is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] at its eastern end on [[Breitscheidplatz]]. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstraße is [[KaDeWe]], claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The [[Rathaus Schöneberg]], where [[John F. Kennedy]] made his famous &quot;[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]!&quot; speech, is situated in [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]].

West of the center, [[Schloss Bellevue]] is the residence of the German President. [[Schloss Charlottenburg]], which was burnt out in the Second World War is the largest historical palace in Berlin.

The [[Funkturm Berlin]] is a {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall lattice radio tower in the fairground area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant {{convert|55|m|ft|abbr=on}} and an observation deck {{convert|126|m|ft|abbr=on}} above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.

The [[Oberbaumbrücke]] is Berlin's most iconic bridge, crossing the [[River Spree]]. It was a former East-West border crossing and connects the boroughs of [[Friedrichshain]] and [[Kreuzberg]]. It was completed in a [[brick gothic]] style in 1896. The center portion has been reconstructed with a steel frame after having been destroyed in 1945. The bridge has an upper deck for the [[Berlin U-Bahn]] line {{BVG lines|U1}}.

In 2014, the city state Berlin had 37.368 live births (+6,6%), a record number since 1991. The number of deaths was 32.314. Almost 2.0 million households were counted in the city. 54 percent of them were single-person households. More than 337.000 families with children under the age of 18 lived in Berlin. In 2014 the German capital registered a migration surplus of approximately 40.000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/produkte/kleinestatistik/AP_kleinestatistik_en_2015_be.pdf statistics Berlin Brandenburg]. www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de Retrieved 10 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Berlin population2.svg|thumb|left|Berlin's population 1880–2012]]

National and international migration into the city has a long history. In 1685, following the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in France, the city responded with the [[Edict of Potsdam]], which guaranteed religious freedom and tax-free status to French Huguenot refugees for ten years. The [[Greater Berlin Act]] in 1920 incorporated many suburbs and surrounding cities of Berlin. It formed most of the territory that comprises modern Berlin and increased the population from 1.9&amp;nbsp;million to 4&amp;nbsp;million.

Active immigration and asylum politics in West Berlin triggered waves of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s.

===Languages===
{{Main article|German language|Berlinerisch dialect}}
[[German language|German]] is the official and predominant spoken language in Berlin. It is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] that derives most of its vocabulary from the Germanic branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family. German is one of 24 languages of the European Union,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/languages/policy/linguistic-diversity/official-languages-eu_en.htm |title=Official Languages |author=European Commission |accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the three [[working language]]s of the [[European Commission]].

Berlinerisch or Berlinisch is a dialect of [[Berlin Brandenburgish dialects|Berlin Brandenburgish German]] spoken in Berlin and the [[Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region|surrounding metropolitan area]]. It originates from a [[Mark Brandenburgish dialects|Mark Brandenburgish]] variant.  The dialect is now seen more as a [[sociolect]], largely through increased immigration and trends among the educated population to speak [[standard German]] in everyday life.

The most-commonly-spoken foreign languages in Berlin are Turkish, English, Russian, Arabic, Polish, Kurdish, Serbian, Croatian, Italian, Vietnamese, and French. Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, Serbo-Croatian are heard more often in the western part, due to the large Middle Eastern and former-Yugoslavian communities. English, Vietnamese, Russian, and Polish have more native speakers in East Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morgenpost.de/printarchiv/wirtschaft/article1309952/Zwei-Millionen-Berliner-sprechen-mindestens-zwei-Sprachen.html |title=Studie – Zwei Millionen Berliner sprechen mindestens zwei Sprachen – Wirtschaft – Berliner Morgenpost – Berlin |publisher=Morgenpost.de |date=18 May 2010 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===City state===
[[File:Berlin- The Rotes Rathaus with the Neptunbrunnen in front - 2752.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rotes Rathaus]], seat of the Senate and Governing Mayor of Berlin]]

Since [[German reunification|the reunification]] on 3 October 1990, Berlin has been one of the three [[States of Germany#Subdivisions|city states in Germany]] among the present 16 states of Germany. The [[Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin|House of Representatives]] (''Abgeordnetenhaus'') functions as the city and state parliament, which currently has 141 seats. Berlin's executive body is the [[Senate of Berlin]] (''Senat von Berlin''). The Senate consists of the [[List of mayors of Berlin|Governing Mayor]] (''Regierender Bürgermeister'') and up to eight senators holding ministerial positions, one of them holding the title of &quot;Mayor&quot; (''Bürgermeister'') as deputy to the Governing Mayor. The total annual state budget of Berlin in 2015 exceeded €24.5 ($30.0) billion including a budget surplus of €205 ($240) million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/berlin/berliner-haushalt-finanzsenator-bleibt-trotz-sprudelnder-steuereinnahmen-vorsichtig-24702234|title=Berliner Haushalt Finanzsenator bleibt trotz sprudelnder Steuereinnahmen vorsichtig |work=Berliner Zeitung |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) and [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] (Die Linke) took control of the city government after the [[Berlin state election, 2001|2001 state election]] and won another term in the [[Berlin state election, 2006|2006 state election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik-berlin.de/produkte/Faltblatt_Brochure/berlin_in_Zahlen_engl.pdf |title=Berlin state election, 2006 |work=Der Landeswahlleiter für Berlin |accessdate=17 August 2008 |language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323161037/https://www.statistik-berlin.de/produkte/Faltblatt_Brochure/berlin_in_Zahlen_engl.pdf |archivedate=23 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Berlin state election, 2016|2016 state election]], there has been a coalition between the Social Democratic Party, the Greens and the Left Party.

The Governing Mayor is simultaneously Lord Mayor of the City of Berlin (''Oberbürgermeister der Stadt'') and Minister President of the Federal State of Berlin (''Ministerpräsident des Bundeslandes''). The office of the Governing Mayor is located in the [[Rotes Rathaus|Rotes Rathaus (Red City Hall)]]. Since 2014 this office has been held by [[Michael Müller (politician)|Michael Müller]] of the Social Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2051103,00.html|title=The Glamor Guy|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time Europe]]|date=8 May 2005|accessdate=17 August 2008}} See also: {{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/23/world/europe/23wowereit.html?ex=1161489600&amp;en=2129daf9965bf613&amp;ei=5070|title=Berlin Mayor, Symbol of Openness, Has National Appeal|work=The New York Times|accessdate=17 August 2008|first=Mark|last=Landler|date=23 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boroughs===
{{Main article|Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin}}
[[File:Berlin Subdivisions.svg|thumb|280px|[[Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin|Berlin's twelve boroughs and their 96 neighborhoods]] ]]

Berlin is subdivided into twelve boroughs or districts (''Bezirke''). Each borough is made up by a number of subdistricts or neighborhoods (''Ortsteile''), which have historic roots in much older municipalities that predate the formation of Greater Berlin on 1 October 1920 and became urbanized and incorporated into the city later on. Many residents strongly identify with their neighbourhoods, colloquially called ''[[Kiez]]'' . At present, Berlin consists of 96 subdistricts, which are commonly made up of several smaller residential areas or quarters.

Each borough is governed by a borough council (''Bezirksamt'') consisting of five councilors (''Bezirksstadträte'') including the borough's mayor (''Bezirksbürgermeister''). The council is elected by the borough assembly (''Bezirksverordnetenversammlung''). However, the individual boroughs are not independent municipalities, but subordinate to the Senate of Berlin. &lt;!-- ([[urban district]], ''Stadtkreis'') --&gt; The borough's mayors make up the council of mayors (''Rat der Bürgermeister''), which is led by the city's Governing Mayor and advises the Senate. The neighborhoods have no local government bodies.

===Twin towns – sister cities===
{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}

Berlin maintains official partnerships with 17 cities.&lt;ref name=Berlinsistercities&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin.de/rbmskzl/en/international-relations/city-partnerships/ |title=City Partnerships |type=official web site |publisher=Governing Mayor of Berlin, Senate Chancellery, Directorate for Protocol and International Relations |website=Berlin.de |accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Twin towns and sister cities|Town twinning]] between Berlin and other cities began with its sister city Los Angeles in 1967. East Berlin's partnerships were canceled at the time of German reunification but later partially reestablished. West Berlin's partnerships had previously been restricted to the borough level. During the Cold War era, the partnerships had reflected the different power blocs, with West Berlin partnering with capitals in the Western World, and East Berlin mostly partnering with cities from the [[Warsaw Pact]] and its allies.

There are several joint projects with many other cities, such as [[Beirut]], [[Belgrade]], [[São Paulo]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Helsinki]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Mumbai]], [[Oslo]], [[Shanghai]], [[Seoul]], [[Sofia]], [[Sydney]], [[New York City]] and [[Vienna]]. Berlin participates in international city associations such as the Union of the Capitals of the European Union, Eurocities, Network of European Cities of Culture, Metropolis, Summit Conference of the World's Major Cities, and Conference of the World's Capital Cities. Berlin's official sister cities are:&lt;ref name=Berlinsistercities/&gt;

===Nightlife and festivals===
[[File:Franzoesischer Dom - Festival of Lights 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|[[French Cathedral, Berlin|French Cathedral]] during the annual [[Festival of Lights (Berlin)|Festival of Lights]] ]]

Berlin's nightlife has been celebrated as one of the most diverse and vibrant of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=6949|title=Losing your mind in Berlin|first=Walter|last=Wasacz|work=[[Metro Times]]|date=11 October 2004|accessdate=18 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s and 80s the [[SO36]] in [[Kreuzberg]] was a centre for [[punk music]] and culture. The ''SOUND'' and the ''Dschungel'' gained notoriety in the context of the city's growing heroin problem and the publication of the movie [[Christiane F. – We Children from Bahnhof Zoo]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christiane.hurz.at/ |title=Christiane F.-Page |publisher=Christiane.hurz.at |accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1990s, people in their 20s from all over the world, particularly those in [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]], made Berlin's club scene a premier nightlife venue. After the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989, many historic buildings in Mitte, the former city centre of East Berlin, were illegally occupied and re-built by young squatters and became a fertile ground for underground and [[counterculture]] gatherings. The central boroughs are home to many nightclubs, including the Watergate, [[Tresor]], [[E-Werk]] and [[Berghain]]. The [[KitKatClub]] and several other locations are known for their sexually uninhibited parties.

Clubs are not required to close at a fixed time during the weekends, and many parties last well into the morning, or even all weekend. The ''Berghain'' features the well-known ''Panorama Bar'', a bar that opens its shades at daybreak, allowing party-goers a panorama view of Berlin after dancing through the night. The ''Weekend Club'' near [[Alexanderplatz]] features a roof terrace that allows partying at almost any time of the day. Several venues have become a popular stage for the [[Neo-Burlesque]] scene.

Berlin has a long history of gay culture, and is an important [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee|birthplace of the LGBT rights movement]]. Same-sex bars and dance halls operated freely as early as the 1880s, and the first gay magazine, ''Der Eigene'', started in 1896. By the 1920s, gays and lesbians had an unprecedented visibility in popular culture.&lt;ref name=Krauss&gt;{{cite book|last=Krauss|first=Kenneth|title=The drama of fallen France: reading la comédie sans tickets|year=2004|publisher=State University of New York|location=Albany|isbn=0-7914-5953-5|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The New Yorker&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine| url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/berlin-story| title=Berlin Story – The New Yorker| author=Alex Ross| date=26 January 2015| magazine=[[The New Yorker]]| publisher=[[Condé Nast]]| accessdate=6 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, in addition to a positive atmosphere in the wider club scene, the city again has a huge number of queer clubs and festivals.

Several technology and media art festivals and conferences are held in the city, including [[Transmediale]] and [[Chaos Communication Congress]]. The annual [[Berlin Festival]] focuses on indie rock, electronic music and synthpop and is part of the International Berlin Music Week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berlinfestival.de/en.html Berlin Festival] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150314234453/http://www.berlinfestival.de/en.html |date=14 March 2015 }} website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berlin-music-week.de/en/ Berlin Music Week] website&lt;/ref&gt; Every year Berlin hosts one of the largest New Year's Eve celebrations in the world, attended by well over a million people. The focal point is the Brandenburg Gate, where midnight fireworks are centred, but various private fireworks displays take place throughout the entire city.

The [[German cuisine|cuisine]] and culinary offerings of Berlin vary greatly. Twelve restaurants in Berlin have been included in the [[Michelin guide]] of 2015, which ranks the city at the top for the number of restaurants having this distinction in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/09/fashion/09iht-luxmag18.html Berlin Minimalist Glamor].

Many local foods originated from north German culinary traditions and include rustic and hearty dishes with pork, goose, fish, peas, beans, cucumbers, or potatoes. Typical Berliner fare include ''[[Currywurst]]'', ''[[Frikadeller|Bulette]]'' and the ''[[Berliner (doughnut)|Berliner]]'' doughnut, known in Berlin as {{lang|de|''Pfannkuchen''}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.germanfoods.org/consumer/facts/berlin.cfm Berlin] German Foods&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/spicy-sausage-that-is-worthy-of-a-shrine-in-berlin-1772530.html|title=Spicy sausage that is worthy of a shrine in Berlin|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|first=Tony|last=Paterson|date=15 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; German bakeries offering a variety of breads and pastries are widespread.

Berlin is also home to a diverse gastronomy scene reflecting the immigrant history of the city. Turkish and Arab immigrants brought their culinary traditions to the city, such as the [[lahmacun]] and [[falafel]], which have become common fast food staples. The modern fast food version of the [[döner kebab]] sandwich [[Kadir Nurman|evolved in Berlin]] in the 1970s, and became a favorite in Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304432704577350194262835880| title=There's Nothing More German Than a Big, Fat Juicy Döner Kebab| author=James Angelos| date=18 April 2012| newspaper=The Wall Street Journal| publisher=| accessdate=6 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asian cuisine like Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, Indian, and sushi restaurants, as well as Spanish tapas bars, Italian, and Greek cuisine, can be found in many parts of the city.

During an interview, Page recalled his childhood, noting that his house &quot;was usually a mess, with computers, science and technology magazines and ''[[Popular Science]]'' magazines all over the place&quot;, an environment in which he immersed himself. Page was an avid reader during his youth, writing in his 2013 Google founders letter that &quot;I remember spending a huge amount of time poring over books and magazines&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://investor.google.com/corporate/2013/founders-letter.html|title=2013 Founders’ Letter|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Larry Page|title=2013 Founders’ Letter|url=https://investor.google.com/corporate/2013/founders-letter.html|website=Google Investor Relations|publisher=Google|accessdate=February 2, 2015|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to writer Nicholas Carlson, the combined influence of Page's home atmosphere and his attentive parents &quot;fostered creativity and invention&quot;. Page also played [[saxophone]] and studied [[music composition]] while growing up. Page has mentioned that his musical education inspired his impatience and obsession with speed in computing. &quot;In some sense I feel like music training led to the high-speed legacy of Google for me,&quot;. In an interview Page said that &quot;In music you’re very cognizant of time. Time is like the primary thing&quot; and that &quot;If you think about it from a music point of view, if you’re a [[percussionist]], you hit something, it’s got to happen in [[milliseconds]], fractions of a second&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Car&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fortune.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2014/11/18/larry-page-music-education/|title=How music education influenced Google CEO Larry Page - Fortune|work=Fortune}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fortune.com&quot;/&gt;

Page was first attracted to computers when he was six years old, as he was able to &quot;play with the stuff lying around&quot;—first-generation personal computers—that had been left by his parents.&lt;ref name=&quot;achievement.org&quot;/&gt; He became the &quot;first kid in his elementary school to turn in an assignment from a [[word processor]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt; His older brother also taught him to take things apart and before long he was taking &quot;everything in his house apart to see how it worked&quot;. He said that &quot;from a very early age, I also realized I wanted to invent things. So I became really interested in technology and business.

== PhD studies and research ==
After enrolling in a [[computer science]] [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] program at [[Stanford University]], Page was in search of a [[dissertation]] theme and considered exploring the mathematical properties of the [[World Wide Web]], understanding its link structure as a huge [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]—his supervisor, [[Terry Winograd]], encouraged him to pursue the idea, and Page recalled in 2008 that it was the best advice he had ever received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The best advice I ever got|url=http://archive.fortune.com/galleries/2008/fortune/0804/gallery.bestadvice.fortune/2.html|website=Fortune|publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=February 2, 2015|date=April 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also considered doing research on [[telepresence]] and [[autonomous cars]] during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Faculty Summit 2009: Meet Google Founder Larry Page|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUNqsYUVPQY|website=GoogleTechTalks on YouTube|publisher=Google|accessdate=February 2, 2015|format=Video upload|date=October 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1016/S0169-75529800110-X&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Brin | first1 = S.| authorlink1 = Sergey Brin| last2 = Page | first2 = L.| authorlink2 = Larry Page| doi = 10.1016/S0169-7552(98)00110-X | title = The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual Web search engine | journal = Computer Networks and ISDN Systems | volume = 30 | pages = 107–117 | year = 1998 | url = http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/papers/google.pdf| issn = 0169-7552| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wiredbirth&quot;/&gt;

Page focused on the problem of finding out which web pages link to a given page, considering the number and nature of such backlinks as valuable information for that page—the role of [[citation]]s in [[academic publishing]] would also become pertinent for the research.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiredbirth&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author1=John Battelle|title=The Birth of Google|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/battelle.html?tw=wn_tophead_4|website=Wired|publisher=Condé Nast Digital|accessdate=February 2, 2015|date=August 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sergey Brin, a fellow Stanford PhD [[student]], would soon join Page's research project, nicknamed &quot;[[BackRub]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wiredbirth&quot;/&gt; Together, the pair authored a research paper titled &quot;The Anatomy of a Large-Scale [[Hypertext]]ual Web Search Engine&quot;, which became one of the most downloaded scientific documents in the history of the Internet at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;achievement.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1016/S0169-75529800110-X&quot;/&gt;

[[John Battelle]], cofounder of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine, wrote that Page had reasoned that the: &lt;blockquote&gt;... entire Web was loosely based on the premise of citation—after all, what is a link but a citation? If he could devise a method to count and qualify each backlink on the Web, as Page puts it &quot;the Web would become a more valuable place.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wiredbirth&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Battelle further described how Page and Brin began working together on the project:{{quote|At the time Page conceived of BackRub, the Web comprised an estimated 10 million documents, with an untold number of links between them. The computing resources required to crawl such a beast were well beyond the usual bounds of a student project. Unaware of exactly what he was getting into, Page began building out his crawler. The idea's complexity and scale lured Brin to the job. A [[polymath]] who had jumped from project to project without settling on a thesis topic, he found the premise behind BackRub fascinating. &quot;I talked to lots of research groups&quot; around the school, Brin recalls, &quot;and this was the most exciting project, both because it tackled the Web, which represents human knowledge, and because I liked Larry.&quot;&lt;ref name=wiredbirth/&gt;}}

=== Search engine development ===
To convert the backlink data gathered by BackRub's [[web crawler]] into a measure of importance for a given web page, Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm, and realized that it could be used to build a [[search engine]] far superior to existing ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiredbirth&quot; /&gt; The new algorithm relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed the relevance of the [[backlink]]s that connected one Web page to another.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moschovitis&quot;&gt;Moschovitis Group. ''The Internet: A Historical Encyclopedia'', ABC-CLIO, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;Combining their ideas, the pair began utilizing Page's dormitory room as a machine laboratory, and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the nascent search engine with Stanford's broadband campus network.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiredbirth&quot;/&gt; After filling Page's room with equipment, they then converted Brin's dorm room into an office and programming center, where they tested their new search engine designs on the Web. The rapid growth of their project caused Stanford's computing infrastructure to experience problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;economist.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Enlightenment man|url=http://www.economist.com/node/12673407|website=The Economist|publisher=The Economist Newspaper Limited|accessdate=February 2, 2015|date=December 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page and Brin used the former's basic [[HTML]] programming skills to set up a simple search page for users, as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate. They also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users. As their search engine grew in popularity among Stanford users, it required additional [[server (computing)|server]]s to process the queries. In August 1996, the initial version of Google, still on the Stanford University website, was made available to Internet users.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiredbirth&quot; /&gt;[[File:Page+brin by origa.jpg|thumb|177x177px|Page and [[Sergey Brin]] by [[Graziano Origa]] ]]By early 1997, the BackRub page described the state as follows:

BackRub already exhibited the rudimentary functions and characteristics of a search engine: a query input was entered and it provided a list of backlinks ranked by importance. Page recalled: &quot;We realized that we had a querying tool. It gave you a good overall ranking of pages and ordering of follow-up pages.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;archive.wired.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/battelle.html?pg=2&amp;topic=battelle&amp;topic_set= |title = Wired 13.08: The Birth of Google |website = wired.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Page said that in mid-1998 they finally realized the further potential of their project: &quot;Pretty soon, we had 10,000 searches a day. And we figured, maybe this is really real.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;economist.com&quot; /&gt;

Some compared Page and Brin's vision to the impact of [[Johannes Gutenberg]], the inventor of modern [[printing]]:
{{Quote|In 1440, Johannes Gutenberg introduced Europe to the mechanical printing press, printing Bibles for mass consumption. The technology allowed for books and manuscripts&amp;nbsp;– originally replicated by hand&amp;nbsp;– to be printed at a much faster rate, thus spreading knowledge and helping to usher in the European Renaissance&amp;nbsp;... Google has done a similar job.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.librarystuff.net/2009/10/01/google-the-gutenberg/ &quot;Google the Gutenberg&quot;]. ''Information Technology''. October 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The comparison was also noted by the authors of ''The Google Story'': &quot;Not since Gutenberg&amp;nbsp;... has any new invention empowered individuals, and transformed access to information, as profoundly as Google.&quot;&lt;ref name=Vise&gt;[[Vise, David]], and [[Malseed, Mark]]. ''[[The Google Story]]'', Delta Publ. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, not long after the two &quot;cooked up their new engine for web searches, they began thinking about information that was at the time beyond the web,&quot; such as digitizing books and expanding health information.&lt;ref name=&quot;economist.com&quot;/&gt;

==== Founding ====
Mark Malseed wrote in a 2007 [[feature story]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Soliciting funds from faculty members, family and friends, Brin and Page scraped together enough to buy some servers and rent that famous garage in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]]. ... [soon after], [[Sun Microsystems]] co-founder [[Andy Bechtolsheim]] wrote a $100,000 check to &quot;Google, Inc.&quot; The only problem was, &quot;Google, Inc.&quot; did not yet exist—the company hadn't yet been incorporated. For two weeks, as they handled the paperwork, the young men had nowhere to deposit the money.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Moment&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malseed|first=Mark|date=February 2007|title=The Story of Sergey Brin|journal=[[Moment Magazine]]|url=http://www.oldsite.momentmag.net/moment/issues/2007/02/200702-BrinFeature.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130121055147/http://www.oldsite.momentmag.net/moment/issues/2007/02/200702-BrinFeature.html| archivedate=January 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1998,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.ca/about/company/history/&lt;/ref&gt; Brin and Page incorporated Google, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.google.com/corporate/execs.html#larry| title = Larry Page Profile | publisher = Google }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the initial domain name of &quot;[[Googol]],&quot; derived from a number that consists of one followed by one hundred zeros—this represented the vast amount of data that the search engine was intended to explore. Following inception, Page appointed himself as CEO, while Brin, named Google's co-founder, served as Google's president.&lt;ref name=&quot;Car&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author1=Nicholas Carlson|title=The Untold Story Of Larry Page's Incredible Comeback|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/larry-page-the-untold-story-2014-4?page=2|website=Business Insider|publisher=Business Insider, Inc|accessdate=February 2, 2015|date=April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer Nicholas Carlson wrote in 2014:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
While Google is often thought of as the invention of two young computer whizzes—Sergey and Larry, Larry and Sergey—the truth is that Google is a creation of Larry Page, helped along by Sergey Brin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Car&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The pair's mission was: &quot;to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sam&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author1=Samuel Gibbs|title=Google has 'outgrown' its 14-year old mission statement, says Larry Page|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/03/larry-page-google-dont-be-evil-sergey-brin|accessdate=February 2, 2015|work=The Guardian|date=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a [[United States dollar|US$]]1-million loan from friends and family, the inaugural team eventually moved into a Mountain View office by the start of 2000. In 1999, Page experimented with smaller sized server units so that Google could fit more into each square meter of the third-party warehouses that the company rented to store their servers, which eventually led to a search engine that ran much faster than Google's competitors at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Car&quot; /&gt;

By June 2000, Google had indexed one billion Internet URLs, or [[Uniform Resource Locators]], making it the most comprehensive search engine on the Web at the time. The company cited [[NEC]] Research Institute data in its June 26 press release, stating that &quot;there are more than 1 billion web pages online today,&quot; with Google &quot;providing access to 560 million full-text indexed web pages and 500 million partially indexed URLs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Launches World’s Largest Search Engine|url=http://googlepress.blogspot.com/2000/06/google-launches-worlds-largest-search.html|website=News From Google|publisher=Google|accessdate=February 2, 2015|date=June 26, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Early management style ====
During his first tenure as CEO, Page embarked on a passed attempt to fire all of Google's project managers in 2001. Page's plan involved all of Google’s engineers reporting to a VP of engineering, who would then report directly to him—Page explained that he didn’t like non-engineers supervising engineers due to their limited technical knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Car&quot; /&gt; Page even documented his management tenets for his team to use as a reference:

*Don't delegate: Do everything you can yourself to make things go faster.
*Don't get in the way if you're not adding value. Let the people actually doing the work talk to each other while you go do something else.
*Don't be a [[bureaucrat]].
*Ideas are more important than age. Just because someone is junior doesn't mean they don't deserve respect and cooperation.
*The worst thing you can do is stop someone from doing something by saying, &quot;No. Period.&quot; If you say no, you have to help them find a better way to get it done.&lt;ref name=&quot;Car&quot; /&gt;

Even though Page's new model was unsustainable and led to disgruntlement among the affected employees, his issue with engineers being managed by non-engineering staff gained traction more broadly. Eventually, the practice of only instating engineers into the management roles of engineering teams was established as a standard across [[Silicon Valley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Max&quot; /&gt;

Page also believed that the faster Google’s search engine returned answers, the more it would be used. He fretted over [[milliseconds]] and pushed his engineers—from those who developed [[algorithm]]s to those who built [[data center]]s—to think about [[lag|lag times]]. He also pushed for keeping Google’s home page famously sparse in its design because it would help the search results load faster.&lt;ref name=&quot;fortune.com&quot;/&gt;

=== 2001–2011 ===

==== Changes in management and expansion ====
Before Silicon Valley's two most prominent investors, [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]] and [[Sequoia Capital]], agreed to invest a combined total of $50 million into Google, they applied pressure on Page to step down as CEO so that a more experienced leader could build a &quot;world-class management team.&quot; Page eventually became amenable to the idea after meeting with other technology CEOs, including [[Steve Jobs]] and Intel’s [[Andrew Grove]]. [[Eric Schmidt]], who had been hired as Chairman of Google in March 2001, left his full-time position as the CEO of [[Novell]] to take on the same role at Google in August of the same year, and Page moved aside to assume the President of Products role.&lt;ref name=&quot;Car&quot; /&gt;

Under Schmidt's leadership, Google underwent a period of major growth and expansion, which included its [[initial public offering]] (IPO) on August 20, 2004. However, he always acted in consultation with Page and Brin when he embarked on initiatives such as the hiring of an executive team and the creation of a [[sales force management system]]. Furthermore, Page remained the boss at Google in the eyes of the employees, as he gave final approval on all new hires and it was Page who provided the signature for the IPO, the latter making him a billionaire at the age of thirty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Car&quot; /&gt;

Page led the acquisition of [[Android (operating system)|Android]] for $50 million in 2005 to fulfill his ambition to place handheld computers in the possession of consumers so that they could access Google from anywhere. The purchase was made without Schmidt's knowledge, but the CEO was not perturbed by the relatively small acquisition. Page became passionate about Android, and spent large amounts of time with Android CEO and cofounder [[Andy Rubin]]. By September 2008, [[T-Mobile]] launched the G1, the first phone using Android software and, by 2010, 17.2 percent of the handset market consisted of Android sales, overtaking Apple for the first time. Android became the world’s most popular mobile operating system shortly afterward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Car&quot; /&gt;

==== Assumption of CEO position at Google ====
Following a January 2011 announcement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704881304576094340081291776.html?mod=googlenews_wsj | title = Google's Page to Replace Schmidt as CEO | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Amir | last=Efrati | date=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Page officially became the chief executive of Google on April 4, 2011, while Schmidt stepped down to become executive chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/about/company/facts/management/#section-board |title=Management team – Company – Google |publisher=Google.com |accessdate=September 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Google had over $180 billion market capitalization and more than 24,000 employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maintour.com/meritbadge/american_business.htm American Business BSA Merit Badge Guide], June 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Schmidt announced the end of his tenure as CEO on January 20, 2011, he jokingly tweeted on [[Twitter]]: &quot;Adult-supervision no longer needed.&quot; [[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] organizational management reporter, Max Nisen, described the decade prior to Page's second appointment as Google's CEO as his &quot;lost decade.&quot; While Page continued to exert a significant influence at Google during this time, overseeing product development and other operations, he became increasingly disconnected and less responsive over time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Car&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Max&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author1=Max Nisen|title=Larry Page’s lost decade was the best thing to ever happen to Google|url=http://qz.com/202710/larry-pages-lost-decade-was-the-best-thing-to-ever-happen-to-google/|accessdate=February 6, 2015|work=Quartz|date=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2011–2013 ===
As Google's new CEO, Page's two key goals were the development of greater autonomy for the executives overseeing the most important divisions, and higher levels of collaboration, communication and unity among the teams. Page also formed what the media called the &quot;L-Team,&quot; a group of senior vice-presidents who reported directly to him and worked in close proximity to his office for a portion of the working week.&lt;ref name=&quot;Owe&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author1=Owen Thomas|title=There's A Pretty Big Tension In How Larry Page Is Running Google|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-larry-page-is-running-google-2013-3?IR=T|website=Business Insider|publisher=Business Insider Inc|accessdate=February 1, 2015|date=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he reorganized the company’s senior management, placing a CEO-like manager at the top of Google's most important product divisions, including [[YouTube]], [[AdWords]], and [[Google Search]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Car&quot; /&gt;

In accordance with a more cohesive team environment, Page declared a new &quot;zero tolerance for fighting&quot; policy that contrasted with his approach during the early days of Google, when he would use his harsh and intense arguments with Brin as an exemplar for senior management. Page had changed his thinking during his time away from the CEO role, as he eventually arrived at the conclusion that his greatly ambitious goals required a harmonious team dynamic. As part of Page's collaborative rejuvenation process, Google's products and applications were consolidated and underwent an [[aesthetic]] overhaul.&lt;ref name=&quot;Max&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Die&quot; /&gt;

==== Changes and consolidation process ====
At least 70 of Google's products, features and services were eventually shut down by March 2013, while the appearance and nature of the remaining ones were unified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Urs Hölzle|title=A second spring of cleaning|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.se/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html|website=Official Google Blog|publisher=Google|accessdate=February 3, 2015|date=March 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hel&quot; /&gt; Jon Wiley, lead designer of Google Search at the time, codenamed Page's redesign overhaul, which officially commenced on April 4, 2011, &quot;Project Kennedy,&quot; based on Page's use of the term &quot;moonshots&quot; to describe ambitious projects in a January 2013 ''[[Wired magazine|Wired]]'' interview.&lt;ref name=&quot;Die&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author1=Dieter Bohn, Ellis Hamburger|title=Redesigning Google: how Larry Page engineered a beautiful revolution|url=http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/24/3904134/google-redesign-how-larry-page-engineered-beautiful-revolution|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media, Inc|accessdate=February 1, 2015|date=January 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lev&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author1=Steven Levy|title=Google’s Larry Page on Why Moon Shots Matter|url=http://www.wired.com/2013/01/ff-qa-larry-page/all/|website=Wired|publisher=Condé Nast|accessdate=February 1, 2015|date=January 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An initiative named &quot;Kanna&quot; previously attempted to create a uniform design aesthetic for Google's range of products, but it was too difficult at that point in the company's history for one team to drive such change. Matias Duarte, senior director of the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] user experience at the time that &quot;Kennedy&quot; started, explained in 2013 that &quot;Google passionately cares about design.&quot; Page proceeded to consult with the Google Creative Lab design team, based in New York City, to find an answer to his question of what a &quot;cohesive vision&quot; of Google might look like.&lt;ref name=&quot;Die&quot; /&gt;

The eventual results of &quot;Kennedy,&quot; which were progressively rolled out from June 2011 until January 2013, were described by [[The Verge]] technology publication as focused upon &quot;refinement, white space, cleanliness, elasticity, usefulness, and most of all simplicity.&quot; The final products were aligned with Page's aim for a consistent suite of products that can &quot;move fast,&quot; and &quot;Kennedy&quot; was called a &quot;design revolution&quot; by Duarte. Page's &quot;UXA&quot; (user/graphics interface) design team then emerged from the &quot;Kennedy&quot; project, tasked with &quot;designing and developing a true [[User interface|UI]] framework that transforms Google's [[application software]] into a beautiful, mature, accessible and consistent platform for its users.&quot; Unspoken of in public, the small UXA unit was designed to ensure that &quot;Kennedy&quot; became an &quot;institution.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Die&quot; /&gt;

==== Acquisition strategy and new products ====
When acquiring products and companies for Google, Page asked whether the [[business acquisition]] passed the toothbrush test as an initial qualifier, asking the question &quot;Is it something you will use once or twice a day, and does it make your life better?&quot;. This approach looked for usefulness above profitability, and long-term potential over near-term financial gain, which has been noted as rare in business acquiring processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.inc.com/larry-kim/how-google-s-ceo-only-buys-companies-that-pass-his-crazy-toothbrush-test.html |title=Why Google's Larry Page Only Buys Companies That Pass His Crazy Toothbrush Test - Inc.com |website = Inc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/in-silicon-valley-mergers-must-meet-the-toothbrush-test/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1 |title =

With [[Facebook]]'s influence rapidly expanding during the start of Page's second tenure, he finally responded to the intensive competition with Google's own social network, [[Google+]], in mid-2011. After several delays, the social network was released through a very limited field test and was led by [[Vic Gundotra]], Google's then senior vice president of social.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Ben Parr |title=Google Launches Google+ To Battle Facebook [PICS] |url = http://mashable.com/2011/06/28/google-plus/ |website=Mashable |publisher=Mashable |accessdate=February 2, 2015 |date=June 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, Page announced that Google would spend $12.5 billion to acquire [[Motorola Mobility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Robin Wauters |title=Google Buys Motorola Mobility For $12.5B, Says &quot;Android Will Stay Open&quot; |url = http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/15/breaking-google-buys-motorola-for-12-5-billion/ |website=TechCrunch |publisher=AOL Inc |accessdate=February 2, 2015|date=August 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purchase was primarily motivated by Google's need to secure [[patents]] to protect Android from lawsuits by companies including [[Apple Inc]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Car&quot; /&gt; Page wrote on Google's official blog on August 15, 2011 that &quot;companies including Microsoft and Apple are banding together in anti-competitive patent attacks on Android. The [[United States Department of Justice]] had to intervene in the results of one recent patent auction to &quot;protect competition and innovation in the [[open source software]] community&quot;... Our acquisition of Motorola will increase competition by strengthening Google’s patent portfolio, which will enable us to better protect Android from anti-competitive threats from Microsoft, Apple and other companies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://googleblog.blogspot.se/2011/08/supercharging-android-google-to-acquire.html |title=Official Google Blog: Supercharging Android: Google to Acquire Motorola Mobility |work=Official Google Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://bgr.com/2011/08/15/google-ceo-larry-page-explains-reasoning-behind-motorola-acquisition-spoiler-patents/|title=Google CEO Larry Page explains reasoning behind Motorola acquisition (spoiler: patents)|work=BGR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page also ventured into hardware and Google unveiled the [[Chromebook]] in May 2012. The hardware product was a laptop that ran on a Google operating system, [[Chrome OS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Om Malik |title=Google launches Chromebook, Chromebox &amp; gets it right |url = https://gigaom.com/2012/05/29/google-newchromebook-chromebox/ |website=Gigaom |publisher=Gigaom, Inc. |accessdate=February 2, 2015 |date=May 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2013–2015 ===
In January 2013, Page participated in a rare interview with ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', in which writer Steven Levy discussed Page's &quot;10X&quot; mentality—Google employees are expected to create products and services that are at least 10 times better than those of its competitors—in the introductory [[blurb]]. [[Astro Teller]], the head of [[Google X]], explained to Levy that 10X is &quot;just core to who he [Page] is,&quot; while Page's &quot;focus is on where the next 10X will come from.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lev&quot; /&gt; In his interview with Levy, Page referred to the success of YouTube and Android as examples of &quot;crazy&quot; ideas that investors were not initially interested in, saying: &quot;If you’re not doing some things that are crazy, then you’re doing the wrong things.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lev&quot; /&gt; Page also stated that he was &quot;very happy&quot; with the status of Google+, and discussed concerns over the Internet in relation to the [[SOPA]] bill and an [[International Telecommunication Union]] proposal that had been recently introduced:&lt;blockquote&gt;
... I do think the Internet’s under much greater attack than it has been in the past. Governments are now afraid of the Internet because of the Middle East stuff, and so they’re a little more willing to listen to what I see as a lot of commercial interests that just want to make money by restricting people’s freedoms. But they’ve also seen a tremendous user reaction, like the backlash against SOPA. I think that governments fight users’ freedoms at their own peril.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lev&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the May 2013 I/O developers conference in [[San Francisco]], Page delivered a keynote address and said that &quot;We're at maybe 1% of what is possible. Despite the faster change, we're still moving slow relative to the opportunities we have. I think a lot of that is because of the negativity... Every story I read is Google vs someone else. That's boring. We should be focusing on building the things that don't exist&quot; and that he was &quot;sad the Web isn't advancing as fast as it should be&quot; citing a perceived focus on negativity and zero sum games among some in the technology sector as a cause for that.&lt;ref name=&quot;brainyquote.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/l/larry_page.html |title=Larry Page Quotes |author=|date=|work=BrainyQuote}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to an audience question, Page noted an issue that Google had been experiencing with [[Microsoft]], whereby the latter made its Outlook program interoperable with Google, but did not allow for [[backward compatibility]]—he referred to Microsoft's practice as &quot;milking off.&quot; During the question-and-answer section of his keynote, Page expressed interest in [[Burning Man]], which Brin had previously praised—it was a motivating factor for the latter during Schmidt's hiring process, as Brin liked that Schmidt had attended the week-long annual event.&lt;ref name=&quot;Car&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/05/google-io-2013-liveblog/#50512764920 |title=Liveblog: Get the Latest Updates From Google I/O 2013 |work=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Shara Tibken |title=Google's Page: We should be building great things that don't exist |url = http://www.cnet.com/news/googles-page-we-should-be-building-great-things-that-dont-exist/ |website=CNet |publisher=CNet |accessdate=February 1, 2015 |date=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, Page launched the independent [[Calico (company)|Calico]] initiative, a [[R&amp;D]] project in the field of [[biotechnology]]. Google announced that Calico seeks to innovate and make improvements in the field of human health, and appointed Art Levinson, chairman of Apple's board and former CEO of [[Genentech]], to be the new division's CEO. Page's official statement read: &quot;Illness and aging affect all our families. With some longer term, moonshot thinking around healthcare and [[biotechnology]], I believe we can improve millions of lives.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Casey Newton |title=Google launches Calico, a new company tasked with extending human life |url = http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/18/4744650/google-launches-calico-as-separate-company-to-improve-human-health |website=The Verge |publisher=Vox Media, Inc. |accessdate=February 2, 2015|date=September 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page participated in a March 2014 TedX conference that was held in [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]]. The presentation was scripted by Page's chief [[Public relations|PR]] executive Rachel Whetstone, and Google’s [[Chief marketing officer|CMO]] Lorraine Twohill, and a demonstration of an artificially intelligent computer program was displayed on a large screen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Car&quot; /&gt;
Page responded to a question about corporations, noting that corporations largely get a &quot;bad rap&quot;, which he stated was because they were probably doing the same incremental things they were doing &quot;50 or 20 years ago&quot;. He went on to juxtapose that kind of incremental approach to his vision of Google counteracting calcification through driving technology innovation at a high rate. Page mentioned [[Elon Musk]] and [[SpaceX]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He [Musk] wants to go to Mars to back up humanity. That’s a worthy goal. We have a lot of employees at Google who’ve become pretty wealthy. You’re working because you want to change the world and make it better ... I’d like for us to help out more than we are.&lt;ref name=bi20140320&gt;{{cite news |last1=Yarow |first1=Jay |title=LARRY PAGE: I Would Rather Give My Billions To Elon Musk Than Charity |url = http://www.businessinsider.com/larry-page-elon-musk-2014-3 |accessdate=28 December 2014 |work=Business Insider |date=20 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Page also mentioned [[Nikola Tesla]] with regard to invention and commercialization:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Invention is not enough. Tesla invented the electric power we use, but he struggled to get it out to people... You have to combine both things: invention and innovation focus, plus the company that can commercialize things and get them to people.&lt;ref name=&quot;brainyquote.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Page announced a major management restructure in October 2014 so that he would no longer need to be responsible for day-to-day product-related decision making. In a memo, Page said that Google's core businesses would be able to progress in a typical manner, while he could focus on the next generation of ambitious projects, including [[Google X]] initiatives; access and energy, including [[Google Fiber]]; smart-home automation through [[Nest Labs]]; and [[biotechnology]] innovations under Calico.&lt;ref name=&quot;techtimes.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.techtimes.com/articles/18697/20141025/the-rise-and-rise-of-sundar-pichai-in-google-and-larry-page-is-loving-it.htm |title=The rise and rise of Sundar Pichai in Google (and Larry Page is loving it) |author=Nicole Arce|publisher=Tech Times |date = October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Page maintained that he would continue as the unofficial &quot;chief product officer.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hel&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author1=MIguel Helft|title=Google's Larry Page: The most ambitious CEO in the universe |url=http://fortune.com/2014/11/13/googles-larry-page-the-most-ambitious-ceo-in-the-universe/ |website=Fortune|publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=February 3, 2015|date=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent to the announcement, the executives in charge of Google's core products reported to then Google Senior Vice President [[Sundar Pichai]], who reported directly to Page.&lt;ref name=&quot;techtimes.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/10/27/in-new-structure-google-ceo-page-aims-for-faster-better-decisions/ |title=In New Structure, Google CEO Page Aims for ‘Faster, Better Decisions’ |author=Rolfe Winkler |work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mobiletor.com/119663/sundar-pichai-india-google-product/ |title=Sundar Pichai moved up the ladder to head Google's products business - Mobiletor.com |author=Shreya Shetty|work=Mobiletor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Larry-Page-Promotes-Sundar-Pichai-to-Chief-of-Core-Google-Products-463126.shtml |title=Larry Page Promotes Sundar Pichai to Chief of Core Google Products |author=Gabriela Vatu|date=October 25, 2014|work=softpedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a November 2014 interview, Page stated that he prioritized the maintenance of his &quot;deep knowledge&quot; of Google's products and breadth of projects, as it had been a key motivating factor for team members. In relation to his then role as the company's CEO, Page said: &quot;I think my job as CEO—I feel like it’s always to be pushing people ahead.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hel&quot; /&gt;

== Alphabet ==
On August 10, 2015, Page announced on Google's official blog that Google had restructured into a number of subsidiaries of a new [[holding company]] known as [[Alphabet Inc.|Alphabet Inc]] with Page becoming CEO of [[Alphabet Inc.|Alphabet Inc]] and [[Sundar Pichai]] assuming the position of CEO of [[Google Inc.]] In his announcement, Page described the planned holding company as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;gIsForGoogle&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/08/google-alphabet.html|title=G is for Google|publisher=Google Official Blog|last1=Page|first1=Larry|accessdate= August 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{pullquote|Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main Internet products contained in Alphabet instead. [...] Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren’t very related.}}

As well as explaining the origin of the company's name:
{{pullquote|We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search! We also like that it means alpha‑bet ([[Alpha (finance)|Alpha]] is investment return above benchmark), which we strive for!}} Page wrote that the motivation behind the reorganization is to make Google &quot;cleaner and more accountable.&quot; He also wrote that there was a desire to improve &quot;the transparency and oversight of what we’re doing,&quot; and to allow greater control of unrelated companies previously within the Google ecosystem.&lt;ref name=&quot;gIsForGoogle&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wire-2015-new-company&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Metz|first1=Cade|title=A New Company Called Alphabet Now Owns Google |url=http://www.wired.com/2015/08/new-company-called-alphabet-owns-google/ |website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Page|first1=Larry|authorlink1=Larry Page|title=G is for Google |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/08/google-alphabet.html |website=Official Google Blog |accessdate=August 10, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810210148/http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/08/google-alphabet.html |archivedate=August 10, 2015|deadurl=no|date=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page is an investor in [[Tesla Motors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconbeat.com/entries/2006/06/01/tesla_motors_new_electric_sportscar_company_raises_40m_from_google_guys_others.html |title=SiliconBeat: Tesla Motors, new electric sportscar company, raises $40M from Google guys, others|work=siliconbeat.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has invested in renewable energy technology, and with the help of [[Google.org]], Google's philanthropic arm, promotes the adoption of plug-in hybrid electric cars{{clarify|date=April 2013}} and other alternative energy investments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot; /&gt;

Page is also interested in the socio-economic effects of advanced intelligent systems and how advanced digital technologies can be used to create abundance (as described in [[Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think|Peter Diamandis' book]]), provide for people's needs, shorten the workweek, and mitigate the potential detrimental effects of [[technological unemployment]].&lt;ref&gt;Larry Page, [[Sergey Brin]] and [[Vinod Khosla]] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wdnp_7atZ0M discuss their views on the societal impact of technology] (July 3, 2014).

On February 18, 2005, Page was granted the [[deed]] on a 9000-sq ft [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture]] house in [[Palo Alto]], [[California]] designed by American artistic [[polymath]] [[Pedro Joseph de Lemos]], a former curator of the Stanford Art Museum and founder of the Carmel Art Institute, after the historic building had been on the market for years with an asking price of [[United States dollar|US$]]7.95 million. A two-story [[stucco]] archway spans the [[driveway]] and the home features intricate stucco work, as well as stone and tile in California [[Arts and Crafts movement]] style built to resemble de Lemos family's [[castle]] in Spain.

The ecohouse was designed to &quot;minimize the impact on the environment.&quot; Page worked with an [[arborist]] to replace some trees that were in poor health with others that used less water to maintain. Page also applied for Green Point Certification, with points given for use of recycled and low or no-VOC ([[volatile organic compound]]) materials and for a roof garden with [[solar panels]]. The house's exterior features [[zinc]] [[cladding (construction)|cladding]] and plenty of windows, including a wall of sliding-glass doors in the rear. It also includes eco-friendly elements such as [[permeable paving]] in the parking court and a pervious path through the trees on the property.

The Google+ post also revealed that Page had donated a considerable sum of money to a vocal-cord nerve-function research program at the Voice Health Institute in [[Boston]], U.S. The program, at Massachusetts General Hospital, is led by Steven Zeitels, the Eugene B. Casey Professor of Laryngeal Surgery.

==Acting career==

===Early film roles and ''21 Jump Street'' (1984–1993)===

Depp's first film release in 1990 was [[John Waters]]' ''[[Cry-Baby]]'', a musical comedy set in the 1950s. Although it was not a box office success upon its initial release, over the years it has gained a [[cult classic]] status. Depp's second 1990 film was [[Tim Burton]]'s film ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'', in which he played the title character opposite [[Dianne Wiest]] and [[Winona Ryder]]. It was a critical and commercial success that established him as leading Hollywood actor{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} and began his long association with Burton. Producer [[Scott Rudin]] has stated that &quot;basically Johnny Depp is playing Tim Burton in all his movies&quot;;{{sfn|Burton|Salisbury|2006|pp=177–178}} although Burton disapproved of the comment, Depp agrees with it. In his introduction to ''Burton on Burton'', a book of interviews with the director, Depp called Burton &quot;...&amp;nbsp;a brother, a friend,&amp;nbsp;... and [a] brave soul&quot;.{{sfn|Burton|Salisbury|2006|p=}}

Depp had no film releases in the following two years, with the exception of a brief cameo in ''[[Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare]]'' (1991), the sixth installment in the ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare of Elm Street]]'' franchise. He appeared in three films in 1993. In the romantic comedy ''[[Benny and Joon]]'', he played an eccentric and illiterate silent film fan who befriends a mentally ill woman and her brother; it became a [[sleeper hit]]. He then starred alongside [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Juliette Lewis]] in [[Lasse Hallström]]'s ''[[What's Eating Gilbert Grape]]'', a drama about a dysfunctional family. In his review of the film, Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said that &quot;Depp manages to command center screen with a greatly affable, appealing characterization.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117902133.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1|title=What's Eating Gilbert Grape Review|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|date=December 6, 1993|work=Variety|accessdate=December 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depp's final 1993 release was [[Emir Kusturica]]'s [[surrealist]] comedy-drama ''[[Arizona Dream]]'', which opened to positive reviews.

===1994–2002===
In 1994, Depp reunited with director Tim Burton, playing the title role in ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', a biographical film about one of history's most inept film directors. Depp later stated that he was at the time depressed about films and filmmaking, but that &quot;within 10 minutes of hearing about the project, I was committed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnold, Gary&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Arnold |first=Gary |title=Depp sees promise in cult filmmaker Ed Wood's story |work=The Washington Times |date=October 2, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the role gave him a &quot;chance to stretch out and have some fun&quot; and that working with [[Martin Landau]], who played [[Bela Lugosi]], &quot;rejuvenated my love for acting&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnold, Gary&quot; /&gt; ''Ed Wood'' received critical acclaim, with [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' writing that Depp had &quot;proved himself as an established, certified great actor&quot; and &quot;captured all the can-do optimism that kept Ed Wood going, thanks to an extremely funny ability to look at the silver lining of any cloud.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Janet Maslin | author-link = Janet Maslin | title = Film Festival Review; Ode to a Director Who Dared to Be Dreadful | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = September 23, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depp was nominated for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] for his performance.
[[File:Johnny Depp Jim Jarmusch Cannes 1995.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Depp with director-screenwriter [[Jim Jarmusch]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1995.]]

The following year, Depp starred in three films. He played opposite [[Marlon Brando]] in the box-office hit ''[[Don Juan DeMarco]]'', as a man who believes he is [[Don Juan]], the world's greatest lover. He then starred in [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s ''[[Dead Man]]'', a [[Western (genre)|Western]] shot entirely in [[black-and-white]]; it was not a commercial success and had mixed critical reviews. Depp's final film of the year was in the financial and critical failure ''[[Nick of Time (film)|Nick of Time]]'', a thriller in which he played an accountant who is told to kill a politician to save his kidnapped daughter.

In 1997, Depp starred alongside [[Al Pacino]] in the crime drama ''[[Donnie Brasco (film)|Donnie Brasco]]'', directed by [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]]. He portrayed [[Joseph D. Pistone]], an undercover FBI Agent who assumes the name 'Donnie Brasco' in order to infiltrate [[American Mafia|the mafia]] in New York City. To prepare for the role, Depp spent time with the real-life Joe Pistone, on whose memoirs the film was based. ''Donnie Brasco'' was a commercial and critical success, and is considered to contain one of Depp's finest performances.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In 1997, Depp also debuted as a director and screenwriter with ''[[The Brave]]''. He starred in it as a poor [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] man, who accepts a proposal from a wealthy man, played by Marlon Brando, to appear in a [[snuff film]] in exchange for money for his family.

Depp was a fan and friend of writer [[Hunter S. Thompson]], and played his alter ego [[Raoul Duke]] in ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' (1998), [[Terry Gilliam]]'s film adaptation of Thompson's pseudobiographical [[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas|novel of the same name]].{{efn| Depp accompanied Thompson as his road manager on one of the author's last book tours.&lt;ref name=&quot;contactmusic&quot;&gt;{{cite web | work=ContactMusic | title = Depp was ray for thompson book tour | url = http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/depp%20was%20ray%20for%20thompson%20book%20tour_1001455 | accessdate =July 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he contributed a foreword to ''[[Gonzo: Photographs by Hunter S. Thompson]]'', a posthumous biography published by ammobooks.com, and in 2008 narrated the documentary film ''[[Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson]]''. Following Thompson's suicide in 2005, Depp paid for most of his memorial event in his hometown of [[Aspen, Colorado]]. Following Thompson's wishes, fireworks were set off and his ashes were shot from a cannon.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News Entertainment |title=Thompson's ashes fired into sky | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4168266.stm |accessdate=June 22, 2007 | date=August 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Depp's next venture with Burton was the period film ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'' (1999), in which he played [[Ichabod Crane]] opposite [[Christina Ricci]] and [[Christopher Walken]]. For his performance, Depp took inspiration from [[Angela Lansbury]], [[Roddy McDowall]] and [[Basil Rathbone]].{{sfn|Burton|Salisbury|2006|pp=177–178}} He stated that he &quot;always thought of Ichabod as a very delicate, fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side, like a frightened little girl.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Johnny Depp on playing Ichabod Crane in ''Sleepy Hollow'' |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=May 2007 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20039648,00.html#20056052|accessdate=December 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, Heard and Depp breached Australia's strict [[biosecurity]] laws when they failed to declare their two [[Yorkshire terrier]]s to the [[Australian Customs Service]] when they flew by private jet into [[Queensland]], where he was working on the fifth ''Pirates'' installment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Johnny Depp's dogs face death in Australia|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-32732313|accessdate=2016-04-18|publisher=BBC News|date=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian [[quarantine]] regulations, which are aimed at keeping [[rabies]] out of the country, require dogs from outside the country be quarantined a minimum of ten days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/national/new-rules-to-bring-quick-release-from-quarantine-for-imported-pets-20131122-2y1mz.html New rules to bring quick release from quarantine for imported pets&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Heard was charged with two counts of illegally importing the dogs into the country and one count of producing a false document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Amber Heard charged with illegally bringing dogs to Australia|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/16/amber-heard-charged-with-taking-dogs-to-australia-johnny-depp|accessdate=2016-04-18|work=The Guardian|date=2015-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, Agriculture Minister [[Barnaby Joyce]] said: &quot;If we start letting movie stars even though they've been the 'sexiest man alive' twice to come into our nation, then why don't we just break the laws for everybody?

===Political and religious views===

Depp stated to the German magazine ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'' in 2003 that &quot;America is dumb, is something like a dumb puppy that has big teeth—that can bite and hurt you, aggressive.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hindu&quot; /&gt; Although he later asserted that the magazine misquoted him and his words were taken out of context, ''Stern'' stood by its story, as did [[CNN]].com in its coverage of the interview. CNN added his remark that he would like his children &quot;to see America as a toy, a broken toy. Investigate it a little, check it out, get this feeling and then get out.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Silverman2003-09-03&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The July 17, 2006 edition of ''[[Newsweek]]'' reprinted the &quot;dumb puppy&quot; quotation, verbatim, in the context of a Letter to the Magazine.

On the October 16, 2011 episode of ''[[Larry King Live]]'', when asked if he had faith, Depp replied, &quot;Yes. I have faith in my kids. And I have—I have faith, you know, that as long as you keep moving forward, just keep walking forward, things will be all right, I suppose, you know. Faith in terms of religion, I don't—religion is not my specialty, you know.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1110/16/lkl.01.html LARRY KING LIVE Transcript], CNN, October 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claims of Native American ancestry and Comanche adoption===

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{other uses2|Diplomat}}
A '''diplomat''' is a person appointed by a [[state (polity)|state]] to conduct [[diplomacy]] with one or more other states or [[international organisation]]s. The main functions of diplomats are: representation and protection of the interests and nationals of the sending state; initiation and facilitation of strategic agreements; treaties and conventions; promotion of information; trade and commerce; technology; and friendly relations. Seasoned diplomats of international repute are used in international organisations (e.g. United Nations) as well as multinational companies for their experience in management and [[Negotiation|negotiating]] skills. Diplomats are members of foreign services and diplomatic corps of various nations of the world.

Diplomats are the oldest form of any of the [[foreign policy]] institutions of the state, predating by centuries [[foreign minister]]s and ministerial offices. They usually have [[diplomatic immunity]].

==Etymology==
''Diplomat'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] διπλωμάτης (''diplōmátēs''), the holder of a [[diploma]] (a folded paper, literally a &quot;folding&quot;), referring in this case not to an educational certificate but to a diplomat's [[Diplomatic correspondence|letters]] of [[Diplomatic accreditation|accreditation]], which enable him or her to carry out duties on behalf of one country or institution within the jurisdiction of another country or institution.

== Career diplomats and political appointees ==
Though any person can be appointed by a state's national government to conduct said state's relations with other states or international organisations, a number of states maintain an institutionalised group of career diplomats—that is, public servants with a steady professional connection to the country's [[Foreign minister|foreign ministry]]. The term ''career diplomat'' is used world-wide&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independentdiplomat.org/about-us/our-staff/paul-whiteway&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;xinhuanet.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/europe/europe/2014-11/25/c_133811052.htm|title=Career diplomat Aurescu becomes Romanian new FM|work=xinhuanet.com|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/career-diplomat-margaret-twomey-is-new-fiji-high-commissioner/story-fn59niix-1227108642256?nk=48a1c6a6c609bdff015a69446f78632f&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/02/world/europe/john-f-tefft-a-career-diplomat-will-go-to-russia.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news12_e/biography_robertoazevedo_brazil_e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kreolmagazine.com/arts-culture/people-of-note/carlos-dos-santos-the-career-diplomat-that-nurtured-foreign-affairs-in-mozambique/|title=Carlos dos santos The Career Diplomat That Nurtured Foreign Affairs in Mozambique - International Magazine Kreol|work=International Magazine Kreol|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;xinhuanet.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3939179.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Asia-Pacific - Princess trapped by palace guard|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8546108.stm|title=BBC News - Lady Ashton takes flak in EU diplomatic battle|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in opposition to ''political appointees'' (that is, people from any other professional backgrounds who may equally be designated by an official government to act as diplomats abroad).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/career-diplomats-worried-influx-political-appointees-state-department/story?id=26605856|title=Career Diplomats Worried About Influx of Political Appointees at State Department|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-brown/political-appointees-diplomats_b_4815869.html|title=Are Political Appointees the Only U.S. Diplomats Who Haven't Been to the Country to Which They Are Assigned?|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While officially posted to an embassy or delegation in a foreign country or accredited to an international organisation, both career diplomats and political appointees enjoy the same diplomatic immunities.

==Diplomatic ranks==
{{main|Diplomatic rank}}

Whether being a career diplomat or a political appointee, every diplomat, while posted abroad, will be classified in one of the ranks of diplomats (secretary, counselor, minister, [[ambassador]], [[Diplomacy|envoy]], or ''[[chargé d'affaires]]'') as regulated by international law (namely, by the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] of 1961).

Diplomats can be contrasted with [[Consul (representative)|consuls]] and [[attaché]]s, who represent their state in a number of administrative ways, but who don't have the diplomat's political functions.

== Function ==
Diplomats in posts collect and report information that could affect national interests, often with advice about how the home-country government should respond. Then, once any policy response has been decided in the home country's capital, posts bear major responsibility for implementing it. Diplomats have the job of conveying, in the most persuasive way possible, the views of the home government to the governments to which they are accredited and, in doing so, of trying to convince those governments to act in ways that suit home-country interests. In this way, diplomats are part of the beginning and the end of each loop in the continuous process through which [[foreign policy]] develops.

In general, it has become harder for diplomats to act autonomously. Diplomats have to seize secure communication systems, emails, and mobile telephones can be tracked down and instruct the most reclusive head of mission. The same technology in reverse gives diplomats the capacity for more immediate input about the policy-making processes in the home capital.

[[Email encryption|Secure email]] has transformed the contact between diplomats and the ministry. It is less likely to leak, and enables more personal contact than the formal [[Telegraphy|cablegram]], with its wide distribution and impersonal style.

=== Advocacy ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
The home country will usually send instructions to a diplomatic post on what foreign policy goals to pursue, but decisions on tactics – who needs to be influenced, what will best persuade them, who are potential allies and adversaries, and how it can be done - are for the diplomats overseas to make.

In this operation, the intelligence, integrity, cultural understanding, and energy of individual diplomats become critical. If competent, they will have developed relationships grounded in trust and mutual understanding with influential members of the country in which they are accredited. They will have worked hard to understand the motives, thought patterns and [[culture]] of the other side.

=== Negotiation ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
The diplomat should be an excellent negotiator but, above all, a catalyst for peace and understanding between peoples. The diplomat's principal role is to foster peaceful relations between states. This role takes on heightened importance if war breaks out. Negotiation must necessarily continue – but within significantly altered contexts.

== Training ==
Most career diplomats have [[university]] [[academic degree|degrees]] in [[international relations]], [[political science]], [[economics]], or [[law]].&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Seldowitz, &quot;The Psychology of Diplomatic Conflict Resolution&quot;, in H. J. Langholtz and C. E.Stout, Eds. ''The Psychology of Diplomacy'' (Westport: Praeger, 2004), pp. 47–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Status and public image ==
Diplomats have generally been considered members of an exclusive and prestigious profession. The public image of diplomats has been described as &quot;a caricature of pinstriped men gliding their way around a never-ending global cocktail party&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Gyngell and Michael Wesley, ''Making Australian Foreign Policy'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), pp. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; J. W. Burton has noted that &quot;despite the absence of any specific professional training, diplomacy has a high professional status, due perhaps to a degree of secrecy and mystery that its practitioners self-consciously promote.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Burton, ''Systems, States, Diplomacy and Rules'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1968), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; The state supports the high status, privileges, and [[self-esteem]] of its diplomats in order to support its own international status and position.

The high regard for diplomats is also due to most countries' conspicuous selection of diplomats, with regard to their professionalism and ability to behave according to a certain [[etiquette]], in order to effectively promote their interests. Also, [[international law]] grants diplomats extensive privileges and [[diplomatic immunity|immunities]], which further distinguishes the diplomat from the status of an ordinary citizen.

== Psychology and loyalty ==
{{Further|Clientitis}}

While posted overseas, there is a danger that diplomats may become disconnected from their own country and culture. Sir [[Harold Nicolson]] acknowledged that diplomats can become &quot;denationalised, internationalised and therefore dehydrated, an elegant empty husk&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Nicolson, ''The Evolution of Diplomacy'' (New York: Collier, 1962) at 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Obama was born in [[Honolulu|Honolulu, Hawaii]], two years after the territory was admitted to the Union as the 50th state. He grew up mostly in Hawaii, but also spent one year of his childhood in [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] and four years in [[Indonesia]]. After graduating from [[Columbia University]] in 1983, he worked as a [[Community organizing|community organizer]] in [[Chicago]]. In 1988 Obama enrolled in [[Harvard Law School]], where he was the first black president of the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]''. After graduation he became a [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] attorney and professor, teaching [[constitutional law]] at the [[University of Chicago Law School]] from 1992 to 2004. Obama [[Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama|represented the 13th District for three terms]] in the [[Illinois Senate]] from 1997 to 2004, when he [[United States Senate election in Illinois, 2004|ran for the U.S. Senate]]. Obama received national attention in 2004, with his unexpected March [[Primary election|primary]] win, his well-received July [[2004 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] [[2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address|keynote address]], and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, Obama was nominated for president, a year after [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|his campaign began]], and after [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008|a close primary campaign]] against [[Hillary Clinton]]. He became president-elect after defeating [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[John McCain]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|general election]], and was [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inaugurated]] on January 20. Nine months later, Obama was named the [[2009 Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate.&lt;!--See [[WP:EGG]] before attempting to hide this link!--&gt;

During his first two years in office, Obama signed more landmark legislation than any Democratic president since [[Lyndon B. Johnson|LBJ]]'s [[Great Society]]. Main reforms were the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], often referred to as &quot;Obamacare&quot;; the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]]; and the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]]. The [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] and [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]] served as [[Stimulus (economics)|economic stimulus]] amidst the [[Great Recession]], but the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2010|GOP regained control of the House of Representatives]] in 2011. After a lengthy debate over the national [[United States debt ceiling|debt limit]], Obama signed the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]] and the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]]. In foreign policy, Obama increased U.S. troop levels in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)|Afghanistan]], reduced nuclear weapons with the U.S.-[[Russia]]n [[New START]] treaty, and [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq|ended military involvement]] in the [[Iraq War]]. He ordered [[2011 military intervention in Libya|military involvement in Libya]] in opposition to [[Muammar Gaddafi]], and the military operation that resulted in the [[death of Osama bin Laden]]. 

After winning [[United States presidential election, 2012|re-election]] over [[Mitt Romney]], Obama was [[Second inauguration of Barack Obama|sworn in for a second term]] in 2013. During his second term, Obama promoted greater inclusiveness for [[LGBT American]]s, with his administration filing briefs that urged the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] to strike down [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]] bans as unconstitutional (''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' and ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]''). Obama also advocated [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]] in response to the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]], and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning [[climate change]] and immigration. In foreign policy, Obama ordered [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present)|military intervention in Iraq]] in response to [[Iraqi insurgency (2011–13)|gains made]] by [[ISIL]] after the [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq|2011 withdrawal from Iraq]], continued the process of [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan|ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan]], promoted discussions that led to the 2015 [[Paris Agreement]] on global climate change, following the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)| invasion in Ukraine]], initiated the [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis|sanctions against Russia]], brokered a [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|nuclear deal with Iran]], and [[United States–Cuban Thaw|normalized U.S. relations with Cuba]].

====Religious views====
[[File:Obamas at church on Inauguration Day 2013.jpg|thumb|Obama and Michelle worship at [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] in Washington, D.C., January 2013]]
Obama is a [[Protestant]] [[Christian]] whose religious views developed in his adult life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christian&quot; /&gt; He wrote in ''The Audacity of Hope'' that he &quot;was not raised in a religious household&quot;. He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet &quot;in many ways the most spiritually awakened person that I have ever known.&quot; He described his father as a &quot;confirmed atheist&quot; by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as &quot;a man who saw religion as not particularly useful.&quot; Obama explained how, through working with [[black church]]es as a [[Community organizing|community organizer]] while in his twenties, he came to understand &quot;the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;social change&quot; /&gt;

In January 2008, Obama told ''[[Christianity Today]]'': &quot;I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian.

Obama called for [[United States Congress|Congress]] to pass legislation reforming [[health care in the United States]], a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal.&lt;ref name=&quot;health reform&quot; /&gt; He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900&amp;nbsp;billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the [[public health insurance option|public option]], to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for [[pre-existing condition]]s, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/us/politics/10obama.html |title = Obama, Armed With Details, Says Health Plan Is Necessary |author = Stolberg, Sheryl Gay |author2 = Zeleny, Jeff |date = September 9, 2009 |newspaper = The New York Times |accessdate = July 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Mike |last = Allen |url = http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0909/26907.html |title = Barack Obama will hedge on public option |work = [[Politico]] |accessdate = July 5, 2015 |date = September 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACA includes [[Provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|health-related provisions]], most of which took effect in 2014, including expanding [[Medicaid]] eligibility for people making up to 133%&amp;nbsp;of the [[federal poverty level]] (FPL) starting in 2014,&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn_ref1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last = Rice |first = Sabriya |url = http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/03/25/health.care.law.basics/index.html |title = 5 key things to remember about health care reform |publisher = CNN |date = March 25, 2010 |accessdate = January 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400%&amp;nbsp;of the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum &quot;out-of-pocket&quot; payment for annual premiums will be from 2% to 9.5% of income,&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehouse&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Grier |first = Peter |url = http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0320/Health-care-reform-bill-101-Who-gets-subsidized-insurance |date = March 20, 2010 |title = Health Care Reform Bill 101 |newspaper = [[The Christian Science Monitor]] |accessdate = July 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing [[health insurance exchange]]s, prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research.

The costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-income [[tax bracket|brackets]], taxes on [[indoor tanning]], cuts to the [[Medicare Advantage]] program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Grier |first = Peter |date = March 21, 2010 |url = http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0321/Health-care-reform-bill-101-Who-will-pay-for-reform |title = Health care reform bill 101: Who will pay for reform? |work = The Christian Science Monitor |accessdate = July 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0319/Health-care-reform-bill-101-Who-must-buy-insurance |title = Health care reform bill 101: Who must buy insurance? |last = Grier |first = Peter |date = March 19, 2010 |work = [[The Christian Science Monitor]] |accessdate = April 7, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100405075157/http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0319/Health-care-reform-bill-101-Who-must-buy-insurance |archivedate = April 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143&amp;nbsp;billion over the first decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Elmendorf |first = Douglas W. |title = H.R. 4872, Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Final Health Care Legislation) |url = http://www.cbo.gov/publication/21351 |publisher = Congressional Budget Office |accessdate = January 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5–4 vote in ''[[National Federation of Independent Business v.

In June 2015, the Court ruled 6–3 in ''[[King v. Burwell]]'' that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges, not only those purchasing plans &quot;established by the State&quot;, as the statute reads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/06/25/supreme-court-upholds-obamacare-subsidies-in-king-v-burwell |title = Supreme Court Upholds Obamacare Subsidies |author = Kimberly Leonard |work = US News &amp; World Report |accessdate = November 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Energy policy====
{{Main article|Energy policy of the Obama administration}}
Prior to June 2014, Obama offered substantial support for a broadly-based &quot;All of the above&quot; approach to domestic energy policy, which Obama has maintained since his first term and which he last confirmed at his State of the Union speech in January 2014 to a mixed reception by both parties. In June 2014, Obama made indications that his administration would consider a shift towards an energy policy more closely tuned to the manufacturing industry and its impact on the domestic economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=James P.

In November 2013, Obama's administration opened [[Negotiations leading to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|negotiations]] with Iran to prevent it from acquiring [[nuclear weapon]]s, which included an [[Joint Plan of Action|interim agreement]]. Negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced July 14, 2015. The deal, titled the &quot;[[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]]&quot;, saw the removal of sanctions in exchange for measures that would prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons. While Obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from Republican and conservative quarters, and from Israeli prime minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Iran deal reached, Obama hails step toward 'more hopeful world' |url = http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/14/us-iran-nuclear-idUSKCN0PM0CE20150714 |date = July 14, 2015 |accessdate = July 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Iran, World Powers Prepare to Sign Nuclear Accord |url = http://www.wsj.com/articles/embargo-on-arms-clouds-iran-nuclear-deal-1436831280 |date = July 14, 2015 |accessdate = July 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Landmark deal reached on Iran nuclear program |url = http://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/14/politics/iran-nuclear-deal/ |date = July 14, 2015 |accessdate = July 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garrett: As a member in good standing, were you a regular attendee of Sunday services? Obama: You know, I won't say that I was a perfect attendee. I was regular in spurts, because there was times when, for example, our child had just been born, our first child. And so we didn't go as regularly then. }}

'''Lionel Andrés''' &quot;'''Leo'''&quot; '''Messi''' ({{IPA-es|ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi|-|Lionel Andrés Messi - Name.ogg}}; born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for Spanish club [[FC Barcelona]] and [[Captain (association football)|captains]] the [[Argentina national football team|Argentina national team]]. Often considered the best player in the world and rated by many in the sport as the greatest of all time, Messi is the only football player in history to win five [[FIFA Ballons d'Or]], four of which he won consecutively, and the first player to win three [[European Golden Shoe]]s.{{refn|group=note|In addition to four FIFA Ballons d'Or, Messi received ''[[France Football]]''{{'}}s [[Ballon d'Or (1956–2009)|Ballon d'Or]] and [[FIFA]]'s [[FIFA World Player of the Year|World Player of the Year award]] prior to their fusion; both organisations credit him with five (FIFA) Ballons d'Or.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Rémy |last=Lacombe |title=Messi, le Cinquième Élément |journal=France Football |date=11 January 2016 |url= http://www.francefootball.fr/news/messi-le-cinquieme-element/623615 |accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Messi, Lloyd, Luis Enrique and Ellis Triumph at FIFA Ballon d'Or 2015 |publisher=FIFA |date=11 January 2016 |url=http://www.fifa.com/news/y=2016/m=1/news=messi-lloyd-luis-enrique-and-ellis-triumph-at-fifa-ballon-d-or-2015-2754944.html |accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} With Barcelona he has won eight [[La Liga]] titles and four [[UEFA Champions League]] titles, as well as four [[Copas del Rey]]. Both a prolific goalscorer and a creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for [[List of La Liga top scorers#All-time top scorers|most goals scored in La Liga]], [[Spanish football top scorers#Top scorers in La Liga by seasons|a La Liga season (50)]], and a football season (82), as well as those for most assists made in La Liga and the [[Copa América]]. He has scored over 500 senior career goals for club and country.

Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi was diagnosed with a [[growth hormone deficiency]] as a child. At age 13, he relocated to Spain to join Barcelona, who agreed to pay for his medical treatment. After a fast progression through Barcelona's youth academy, Messi made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. Despite being injury-prone during his early career, he established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, finishing 2007 as a finalist for both the [[Ballon d'Or]] and [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] award, a feat he repeated the following year. His first uninterrupted campaign came in the 2008–09 season, during which he helped Barcelona achieve the first [[Treble (association football)|treble]] in Spanish football. At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award by record voting margins.

Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning three consecutive FIFA Ballons d'Or, including an unprecedented fourth. His personal best campaign to date was the 2011–12 season, in which he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as [[List of FC Barcelona records and statistics#Records|Barcelona's all-time top scorer]] in official competitions in March 2012. He again struggled with injury during the following two seasons, twice finishing second for the Ballon d'Or behind [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], his perceived [[Messi–Ronaldo rivalry|career rival]]. Messi regained his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, breaking the all-time goalscoring records in both La Liga and the [[List of European Cup and UEFA Champions League top scorers#All-time top scorers|Champions League]] in November 2014,{{refn|group=note|Since surpassed by Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi is the second-highest goalscorer in the European Cup/Champions League as of December 2016.}} and led Barcelona to a historic second treble.

An Argentine international, Messi is his country's [[Argentina national football team#Top goalscorers|all-time leading goalscorer]]. At youth level, he won the [[2005 FIFA World Youth Championship]], finishing the tournament with both the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup#Awards|Golden Ball and Golden Shoe]], and an [[Olympic medal|Olympic gold medal]] at the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympics]]. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbler]] drew comparisons with compatriot [[Diego Maradona]], who declared the teenager his [[New Maradona|successor]]. After making his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a [[FIFA World Cup]] during the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 edition]], and reached the final of the [[2007 Copa América]], where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's [[Captain (association football)|captain]] from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]], for which he won the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Ball|Golden Ball]], the [[2015 Copa América|2015]] and the [[Copa América Centenario|2016 Copas América]].

==Early life==
Lionel Andrés Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in [[Rosario]], [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish heritage, the great-grandson of immigrants from [[Marche]] and [[Catalonia]], and on his mother's side, he is of primarily Italian descent.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=32–37}} Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, &quot;Leo&quot; developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, [[Maxi Biancucchi|Maximiliano]] and [[Emanuel Biancucchi]], both of whom became professional footballers.{{sfn|Caioli|2012|pp=9–10}} At the age of four years, he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Magic in His Feet&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Carlin |title=Lionel Messi: Magic in His Feet |newspaper=The Independent |date=27 March 2010 |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/lionel-messi-magic-in-his-feet-1928768.html |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute of his grandmother.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=44–45}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Maume |title=Lionel Messi: The World at His Feet |newspaper=The Independent |date=11 July 2014 |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/lionel-messi-the-world-at-his-feet-9601215.html |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=&quot;When you saw him you would think: this kid can't play ball. He's a dwarf, he's too fragile, too small. But immediately you'd realise that he was born different, that he was a phenomenon and that he was going to be something impressive.&quot;|source=—[[Newell's Old Boys]] youth coach [[Adrián Coria]] shares his first impression of the 12-year-old Messi.{{sfn|Caioli|2012|p=38}}}}

A lifelong supporter of [[Newell's Old Boys]], Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of &quot;The Machine of '87&quot;, the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games.&lt;ref name=&quot;Here and Gone&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Wright |last=Thompson |title=Here and Gone: The Strange Relationship between Lionel Messi and His Hometown in Argentina |work=Outside the Lines |publisher=ESPN FC |date=22 October 2012 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=lionel-messi |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Caioli|2012|pp=31–35}} However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, at age 10, he was diagnosed with a [[growth hormone deficiency]]. As his father's health insurance covered only two years of [[growth hormone treatment]], which cost at least [[Argentine peso|$]]1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Legend of El Enano&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first1=Jérôme |last1=Cazadieu |first2=Alexandre |last2=Juillard |first3=Frédéric |last3=Traïni |title=Leo Messi: La Légende d'El Enano |trans_title=Leo Messi: The Legend of El Enano |newspaper=L'Équipe via Irish Independent |date=15 November 2008 |url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/rosario-the-old-coach-and-the-kid-26496103.html |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was scouted by Buenos Aires club [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]], whose [[playmaker]], [[Pablo Aimar]], he idolised, but they were also unable to pay for his treatment due to the country's [[1998–2002 Argentine great depression|economic collapse]].&lt;ref name=&quot;On a Mission&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Hawkey |title=Lionel Messi on a Mission |newspaper=The Times {{subscription required}} |date=20 April 2008 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/european_football/article3779961.ece |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830020412/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/european_football/article3779961.ece |archivedate=30 August 2008 |deadurl=no |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pablo Aimar: The Argentinian Wizard Admired by Maradona and Messi&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Wilson |title=Pablo Aimar: The Argentinian Wizard Admired by Maradona and Messi |newspaper=The Guardian |date=16 July 2015 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jul/16/pablo-aimar-next-diego-maradona-argentina-retired-age-35-valencia |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La Masia (Can Planas) (Barcelona) - 1.jpg|thumb|left|Messi enrolled at Barcelona's youth academy, [[La Masia]], at age 13.]]

As the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in September 2000. First team director [[Carles Rexach|Charly Rexach]] immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.&lt;ref name=&quot;On a Mission&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;How Argentinian Teenager Signed for Barcelona on a Serviette&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Sid |last=Lowe |title=Lionel Messi: How Argentinian Teenager Signed for Barcelona on a Serviette |newspaper=The Guardian |date=15 October 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/oct/15/lionel-messi-barcelona-decade |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, [[Camp Nou]]. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the ''Infantiles'' due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, María Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.&lt;ref name=&quot;Here and Gone&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;How Argentinian Teenager Signed for Barcelona on a Serviette&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boy Genius&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeré |last=Longman |title=Lionel Messi: Boy Genius |newspaper=The New York Times |date=21 May 2011 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/22/sports/soccer/lionel-messi-boy-genius.html |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a year at Barcelona's youth academy, [[La Masia]], Messi was finally enrolled in the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation]] (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were [[Cesc Fàbregas]] and [[Gerard Piqué]].{{sfn|Caioli|2012|pp=61–62}} After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14,{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=149}} Messi became an integral part of the &quot;Baby Dream Team&quot;, Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002–03), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the ''Cadetes'' A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups.{{sfn|Caioli|2012|pp=61–62}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Class of 2002&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Pete |last=Jenson |title=Fàbregas, Messi, Piqué: Class of 2002 |newspaper=The Independent |date=27 March 2010 |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/fabregas-messi-pique-class-of-2002-1928682.html |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Copa Catalunya final, a 4–1 victory over [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]], became known in club lore as the ''partido de la máscara'', the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution.{{sfn|Hunter|2012|pp=44–45}} At the close of the season, he received an offer to join [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], his first from a foreign club, but while Fàbregas and Piqué soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.&lt;ref name=&quot;How Argentinian Teenager Signed for Barcelona on a Serviette&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lionel Messi Could Have Joined Arsenal as a Teenager, Says Arsène Wenger |newspaper=The Guardian |date=21 November 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/21/arsenal-arsene-wenger-lionel-messi-barcelona |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The New Messiah&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The New Messiah |publisher=FIFA |date=5 March 2006 |url=http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/clubworldcup/japan2006/news/newsid=103182/index.html |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2003–04 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for a record five teams in a single campaign. After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the ''Juveniles'' B, he played only one official match with the team before being promoted to the ''Juveniles'' A, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.{{sfn|Caioli|2012|pp=68–71}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Liviu |last=Bird |title=Ex-Teammate, La Masia Coach Recall Lionel Messi's Early Days, Persona |journal=Sports, Illustrated |date=5 June 2015 |url=http://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2015/06/04/lionel-messi-champions-league-final-barcelona |accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break.

[[File:Leo messi barce 2005.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Messi against [[Málaga CF|Málaga]] in 2005]]

To gain further match experience, Messi joined [[FC Barcelona C|Barcelona C]] in addition to the ''Juveniles'' A, playing his first game for the third team on 29 November. He helped save them from the relegation zone of the [[Tercera División]], scoring five goals in ten games, including a hat-trick in eight minutes during a Copa del Rey match while man-marked by [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]]'s [[Sergio Ramos]].{{sfn|Caioli|2012|pp=68–71}}{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=183–185}} His progress was reflected in his first professional contract, signed on 4 February 2004, which lasted until 2012 and contained an initial [[buyout clause]] of €30&amp;nbsp;million. A month later, on 6 March, he made his debut for Barcelona B in the [[Segunda División B]], and his buyout clause automatically increased to €80&amp;nbsp;million.{{sfn|Caioli|2012|pp=68–71}}{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=262–263}} He played five games with the B team that season but did not score.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matches 2003–04&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini: Matches 2003–04 |publisher=BDFutbol |url=http://www.bdfutbol.com/en/p/j1753.html?temp=2003-04 |accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physically he was weaker than his opponents, who were often much older and taller, and in training he worked on increasing his muscle mass and overall strength in order to be able to shake off defenders.

Barcelona had virtually secured their La Liga title by the start of 2013, eventually equalling Real Madrid's 100-point record of the previous season.

After four largely injury-free seasons, the muscular injuries that had previously plagued Messi reoccurred. After he suffered a hamstring strain on 2 April, during the first quarter-final against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]], his appearances became sporadic. In the second leg against PSG, with an underperforming Barcelona down a goal, Messi came off the bench in the second half and within nine minutes helped create their game-tying goal, which allowed them to progress to the semi-finals. Still unfit, he proved ineffective during the first leg against Bayern Munich and was unable to play at all during the second, as Barcelona were defeated 7–0 on aggregate by the eventual champions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lionel Messi Set to Miss Rest of Barcelona Season with Hamstring Injury |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=14 May 2013 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/players/lionel-messi/10056107/Lionel-Messi-set-to-miss-rest-of-Barcelona-season-with-hamstring-injury.html |accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Messidependencia Brought into Focus as Barcelona Show Vulnerability&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Sid |last=Lowe |title=Messidependencia Brought into Focus as Barcelona Show Vulnerability |newspaper=The Guardian |date=11 April 2013 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/apr/11/lionel-messi-barcelona-psg-champions-league |accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These matches gave credence to the notion of ''Messidependencia'', Barcelona's perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.&lt;ref name=&quot;Messidependencia Brought into Focus as Barcelona Show Vulnerability&quot;/&gt;

==Argentina national team==

===2004–05: Success at youth level===
As a dual Argentine-Spanish national, Messi was eligible to play for the national team of both countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Burden of Being Messi&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeff |last=Himmelman |title=The Burden of Being Messi|newspaper=The New York Times |date=5 June 2014 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/08/magazine/the-burden-of-being-messi.html?_r=0 |accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selectors for Spain's Under-17 squad began pursuing him in 2003 after Barcelona's director of football, [[Carles Rexach]], alerted the Royal Spanish Football Federation to their young player. Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent ''La Albiceleste'' since childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking him, the [[Argentine Football Association]] organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in [[FIFA]]. Five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 June, he made his debut for his country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two assists in their 8–0 victory. He was subsequently included in the squad for the [[2005 South American U-20 Championship|South American Youth Championship]], held in Colombia in February 2005. As he lacked the stamina of his teammates, the result of his former growth hormone deficiency, he was used as a substitute in six of the nine games, proving more effective when coming on in the second half. After being named man of the match against Venezuela, he scored the winning 2–1 goal in the crucial last match against Brazil, thereby securing their third-place qualification for the [[2005 FIFA World Youth Championship|FIFA World Youth Championship]].{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=209–219}}

Aware of his physical limitations, Messi employed a personal trainer to increase his muscle mass, returning to the squad in improved condition in time for the World Youth Championship, hosted by the Netherlands in June 2005. After he was left out of the starting line-up in their first match against the United States, a 1–0 defeat, the squad's senior players asked manager Francisco Ferraro to let Messi start, as they considered him their best player. After helping the team defeat Egypt and Germany to progress past the group stage, Messi proved decisive in the knockout phase as he scored their equaliser against Colombia, provided a goal and an assist against title favourites Spain, and scored their opening goal against reigning champions Brazil. Ahead of the final, he was awarded the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup#Awards|Golden Ball]] as the best player of the tournament. He scored two penalties in their 2–1 victory over Nigeria, clinching Argentina's fifth championship and finishing the tournament as top scorer with 6 goals.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=220–240}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Magic Messi Sparks High Drama in the Lowlands&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Magic Messi Sparks High Drama in the Lowlands |publisher=FIFA |date=July 2005 |url=http://www.fifa.com/u20worldcup/news/y=2007/m=3/news=magic-messi-sparks-high-drama-the-lowlands-501784.html |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performances drew comparisons with compatriot [[Diego Maradona]], who had led Argentina to the [[1979 FIFA World Youth Championship|title in 1979]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Magic Messi Sparks High Drama in the Lowlands&quot;/&gt;

===2005–06: Senior and World Cup debuts===
In recognition of his achievements with the under-20 side, senior manager [[José Pékerman]] gave Messi his first call-up for a friendly against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] on 17 August 2005. Aged 18, Messi made his senior debut for Argentina when he came on in the 63rd minute, only to be sent off after two minutes for a perceived foul against [[Vilmos Vanczák]], who had grabbed his shirt; Messi had struck the defender with his arm while trying to shake him off, which the referee interpreted as an intentional elbowing, a contentious decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tim |last=Vickery |title=Messi Handles 'New Maradona' Tag |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 August 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_football/4172400.stm |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Messi was reportedly found weeping in the dressing room after his sending-off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Messi's Debut Dream Turns Sour |publisher=ESPN FC |url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/339694/messis-debut-dream-turns-sour |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the team on 3 September in their World Cup qualifier defeat to [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]], which he had declared his &quot;re-debut&quot; ahead of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Messi Tries Again as Argentina Face Paraguay |publisher=ESPN FC |date=2 September 2005 |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/preview?id=178848&amp;cc=5739 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628224026/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/preview?id=178848&amp;cc=5739 |archivedate=28 June 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Messi started his first game in the next qualifying match against [[Peru national football team|Peru]], in which he was able to win a crucial penalty that secured their victory.

During the World Cup in Germany, Messi witnessed their opening match victory against the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] from the substitutes' bench. In the next match, against [[Serbia national football team|Serbia and Montenegro]], he became the youngest player to represent Argentina at a [[FIFA World Cup]] when he came on as a substitute in the 74th minute. He assisted their fourth strike within minutes and scored the final goal in their 6–0 victory, making him the youngest scorer in the tournament and the sixth-youngest goalscorer in the history of the World Cup.&lt;ref name=&quot;Argentina 6–0 Serbia &amp; Montenegro&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Argentina 6–0 Serbia &amp; Montenegro |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 June 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4853028.stm |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As their progression to the knockout phase was secured, several starters were rested during the last group match.

At the quarter-final stage, where the group winners faced Peru, he scored the second goal of a 4–0 victory that saw them through to the semi-final, during which he chipped the ball over Mexico's goalkeeper to ensure another 3–0 win.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=384–387}} In a surprise defeat, Argentina lost the final 3–0 to a [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] squad which lacked several of the nation's best players.&lt;ref name=&quot;Missing Some Stars, Brazil Wins Copa América&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Missing Some Stars, Brazil Wins Copa América |newspaper=The New York Times |date=16 July 2007 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/16/sports/soccer/16soccer.html |accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their unexpected loss was followed by much criticism in Argentina, though Messi was mostly exempt due to his young age and secondary status to star player [[Juan Román Riquelme]].{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=384–387}} He was named the best young player of the tournament by [[CONMEBOL]].{{sfn|Caioli|2012|p=156}}

Against the Netherlands, he again scored the first goal and assisted a second strike to help his team to a 2–1 win in extra time.

===2008–11: Collective decline===
From late 2008, the national team experienced a three-year period marked by poor performances.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=384–387}} Under manager Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to World Cup victory as a player, the team struggled to qualify for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], securing their place in the tournament only after defeating [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] 1–0 in their last qualifying match. Maradona was criticised for his strategic decisions as he played Messi out of position, positioned too deep for him to be able to contribute to the attack to his full ability. In eight qualifying matches under Maradona's stewardship, Messi scored only one goal, netting the opening goal in the first such match, a 4–0 victory over [[Venezuela national football team|Venezuela]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Century of International Appearances&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Lisi|2011|pp=533–539}} During that game, played on 28 March 2009, he wore Argentina's number 10 shirt for the first time, following the international retirement of Riquelme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Chadband |title=Lionel Messi Can Achieve More at Barcelona than Diego Maradona |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=28 April 2009 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/5231676/Lionel-Messi-can-achieve-more-at-Barcelona-than-Diego-Maradona.html |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Messi scored four goals in 18 appearances during the qualifying process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Century of International Appearances&quot;/&gt; Ahead of the tournament, Maradona visited Messi in Barcelona to request his tactical input; Messi then outlined a 4–3–1–2 formation with himself playing behind the two strikers, a playmaking position known as the ''enganche'' in Argentine football, which had been his preferred position since childhood.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=155–156, 405–406}}

Despite their poor qualifying campaign, Argentina were considered title contenders at the World Cup in South Africa. At the start of the tournament, the new formation proved effective; Messi managed at least four attempts on goal during their opening match but was repeatedly denied by [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]]'s goalkeeper, resulting in a 1–0 win. During the next match, against [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]], he excelled in his playmaking role, participating in all four goals of his side's 4–1 victory. As their place in the knockout phase was guaranteed, most of the starters were rested during the last group match, but Messi reportedly refused to be benched.{{sfn|Lisi|2011|pp=533–539}} He wore the captain's armband for the first time in their 2–0 win against [[Greece national football team|Greece]]; as the focal point of their play, he helped create their second goal to see Argentina finish as group winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rory |last=Smith |title=Greece 0 Argentina 2: Match Report |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=22 June 2010 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/news/7842201/Greece-0-Argentina-2-match-report.html |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rex |last=Gowar |title=Messi Captains Argentina for First Time |publisher=Reuters |date=22 June 2010 |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/06/22/us-soccer-world-greece-argentina-teams-idUSTRE65L4TE20100622 |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the round of 16, they defeated Mexico 3–1, with Messi assisting their first goal, a controversial strike that stood despite being offside.{{sfn|Lisi|2011|pp=564–567}}

Argentina's unstructured defence had proved a liability throughout the World Cup and finally led to their elimination in the quarter-final against Germany, at the same stage of the tournament and by the same opponent as four years earlier. Their 4–0 loss was their worst margin of defeat since 1974.{{sfn|Lisi|2011|pp=564–567}} FIFA subsequently identified Messi as one of the tournament's 10 best players, citing his &quot;outstanding&quot; pace and creativity and &quot;spectacular and efficient&quot; dribbling, shooting and passing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Adidas Golden Ball Nominees Announced |publisher=FIFA |date=9 July 2010 |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2010/m=7/news=adidas-golden-ball-nominees-announced-1270753.html |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back home, however, Messi was the subject of far harsher judgement. As the perceived best player in the world, he had been expected to lead an average team to the title, as Maradona arguably [[1986 FIFA World Cup|did in 1986]], but he had failed to replicate his performances at Barcelona with the national team, leading to the accusation that he cared less about his country than his club.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=414–420}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Holland vs Argentina: How Coach Alejandro Sabella Persuaded Lionel Messi Not to Quit the National Team&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Guillem |last=Balagué |title=Holland vs Argentina: How Coach Alejandro Sabella Persuaded Lionel Messi Not to Quit the National Team |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=8 July 2014 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/argentina/10954975/Holland-vs-Argentina-How-coach-Alejandro-Sabella-persuaded-Lionel-Messi-not-to-quit-the-national-team.html |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maradona was replaced by Sergio Batista, who had orchestrated Argentina's Olympic victory. Batista publicly stated that he intended to build the team around Messi, employing him as a [[Forward (association football)#False9|false nine]] within a 4–3–3 system, as used to much success by Barcelona.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=414–420}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Lionel Messi Showing Some Promising Signs in a New Argentina Role&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Cox |title=Lionel Messi Showing Some Promising Signs in a New Argentina Role |publisher=ESPN FC |date=13 November 2014 |url=http://www.espnfc.com/blog/tactics-and-analysis/67/post/2144957/argentina-national-team-lionel-messi-showing-some-promising-signs-in-a-new-argentina-role |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Messi scored a record 53 goals during the 2010–11 club season, he had not scored for Argentina in an official match since March 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matches 2010–11&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Century of International Appearances&quot;/&gt; Despite the tactical change, his goal drought continued during the [[2011 Copa América]], hosted by Argentina. Their first two matches, against Bolivia and Colombia, ended in draws, with Messi underperforming by his standards. Media and fans noted that he did not combine well with striker [[Carlos Tevez]], who enjoyed far greater popularity among the Argentine public; Messi was consequently booed by his own team's supporters for the first time in his career. During the crucial next match, with Tevez on the bench, he gave a well-received performance, assisting two goals in their 3–0 victory over [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]]. After the quarter-final against Uruguay ended in a 1–1 draw following extra time, with Messi having assisted their equaliser, Argentina were eliminated 4–5 in the penalty shootout by the eventual champions.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=414–420}}

===2011–13: Assuming the captaincy===
[[File:Suisse vs Argentine - Granit Xhaka &amp; Lionel Messi crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Messi scored his first international [[hat-trick]] against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] in February 2012.]]

After Argentina's unsuccessful performance in the Copa América, Batista was replaced by [[Alejandro Sabella]]. Upon his appointment in August 2011, Sabella awarded the 24-year-old Messi the captaincy of the squad, in accord with then-captain [[Javier Mascherano]]. Reserved by nature, Messi went on to lead his squad by example as their best player, while Mascherano continued to fulfil the role of the team's on-field leader and motivator.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=595–602}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rob |last=Hughes |title=If Messi Is Argentina's Star, Then Mascherano Is the Glue |newspaper=The New York Times |date=10 July 2014 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/11/sports/soccer/if-messi-is-argentinas-star-then-mascherano-is-the-glue.html |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a further redesign of the team, Sabella dismissed Tevez and brought in players with whom Messi had won the World Youth Championship and Olympic Games. Now playing in a free role in an improving team, Messi finally ended his goal drought by scoring during their first World Cup qualifying match against [[Chile national football team|Chile]] on 7 October, his first official goal for Argentina in two-and-a-half years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Century of International Appearances&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=595–602}}

Under Sabella, Messi's goalscoring rate drastically increased; where he had scored only 17 goals in 61 matches under his previous managers, he scored 25 times in 32 appearances during the following three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Century of International Appearances&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=595–602}} He netted a total of 12 goals in 9 games for Argentina in 2012, equalling the record held by [[Gabriel Batistuta]], Argentina's all-time top scorer, for the most goals scored in a calendar year for their country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lionel Messi's Incredible Record-Breaking Year in Numbers&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Adamson |title=Lionel Messi's Incredible Record-Breaking Year in Numbers |newspaper=The Guardian |date=10 December 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/dec/10/lionel-messi-record-year-numbers |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Bryan |title=Record-Breaking Messi Sees the Bigger Picture |publisher=UEFA |date=10 December 2012 |url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=esp/news/newsid=1906190.html |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first hat-trick with the ''Albicelestes'' came in a friendly against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] on 29 February 2012, followed by two more hat-tricks over the next year-and-a-half in friendlies against Brazil and [[Guatemala national football team|Guatemala]]. Messi then helped the team secure their place in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] with a 5–2 victory over Paraguay on 10 September 2013; in addition to providing an assist, he scored twice from a penalty kick, taking his international tally to 37 goals to become Argentina's second-highest goalscorer behind only Batistuta. Overall, he had scored a total of 10 goals in 14 matches during the qualifying campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Century of International Appearances&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=FIFA World Cup Qualifying: Paraguay 2 Argentina 5 |journal=FourFourTwo |date=11 September 2013 |url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/fifa-world-cup-qualifying-paraguay-2-argentina-5 |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently with his bettered performances, his relationship with his compatriots improved, as he gradually began to be perceived more favourably in Argentina.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=595–602}}

===2014–15: World Cup and Copa América finals===
Ahead of the World Cup in Brazil, doubts persisted over Messi's form, as he finished an unsuccessful and injury-plagued season with Barcelona. At the start of the tournament, however, he gave strong performances, being elected man of the match in their first four matches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lionel Messi and Argentina in Tune at Last despite Tough Start to World Cup&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil Technical Report and Statistics&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil Technical Report and Statistics |publisher=FIFA |pages=170–171 |format=PDF |url=http://resources.fifa.com/mm/document/footballdevelopment/technicalsupport/02/42/15/40/2014fwc_tsg_report_15082014web_neutral.pdf |accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first World Cup match as captain, he led them to a 2–1 victory over [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]]; he helped create their early opening goal and scored their second strike after a dribble past three players, his first World Cup goal since his debut in the tournament eight years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mandeep |last=Sanghera |title=Argentina 2–1 Bos-Herce |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 June 2014 |url=http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25285099 |accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the second match against [[Iran national football team|Iran]], he scored an injury-time goal from {{convert|25|yd|m|disp=out|abbr=off}} out to end the game in a 1–0 win, securing their qualification for the knockout phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rob |last=Smyth |title=Argentina v Iran, World Cup 2014: Live |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=21 June 2014 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/10916423/Argentina-vs-Iran-World-Cup-2014-live.html |accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored twice in the last group match, a 3–2 victory over Nigeria, his second goal from a free kick, as they finished first in their group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Saj |last=Chowdhury |title=Nigeria 2–3 Argentina |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 June 2014 |url=http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/25285406 |accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Messi assisted a late goal in extra time to ensure a 1–0 win against Switzerland in the round of 16, before starting the play that led to their match-winning 1–0 goal in the quarter-final against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], helping Argentina progress to the semi-final of the World Cup for the first time [[1990 FIFA World Cup|since 1990]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jonathan |last=Jurejko |title=Argentina 1–0 Switzerland |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 July 2014 |url=http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27990606 |accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ken |last=Ferris |title=Argentina Beat Belgium to Reach First Semi since 1990 |publisher=Reuters |date=5 July 2014 |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/07/05/soccer-world-m60-arg-bel-idINKBN0FA0PA20140705 |accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a 0–0 draw in extra time, they eliminated the Netherlands 4–2 in a penalty shootout to reach the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Netherlands 0–0 Argentina |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 July 2014 |url=http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28122293 |accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line.

Tactically, Messi plays in a free attacking role; a versatile player, he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch.

Throughout his career, Messi has been compared with his compatriot Diego Maradona, due to their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed dribblers.

In Argentine society, Messi is generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona, a consequence of not only his uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. Messi is in some ways the antithesis of his predecessor: where Maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums, Messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Burden of Being Messi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeré |last=Longman |title=Adept?

Messi's global popularity and influence are well documented. He was among the [[Time 100|''Time'' 100]], an annual list of the world's most influential people as published by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', in 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Thierry |last=Henry |title=The 2011 Time 100: Lionel Messi, God of the Field |journal=Time |date=21 April 2011 |url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2066367_2066369_2066498,00.html |accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mia |last=Hamm |title=The World's 100 Most Influential People 2012: Lionel Messi |journal=Time |date=18 April 2012 |url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2111975_2111976_2112092,00.html |accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His fanbase on the social media website [[Facebook]] is among the largest of all public figures: within seven hours of its launch in April 2011, his Facebook page had nearly seven&amp;nbsp;million followers, and by November 2013, he had become only the second sportsperson, after Cristiano Ronaldo, to amass over 50&amp;nbsp;million followers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cristiano Ronaldo: He's Got a God-Given Talent – and He Knows It&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Messi Joins Facebook, Nets 7m Followers |publisher=ESPN FC |date=6 April 2011 |url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/903705/lionel-messi-joins-facebook-nets-7m-followers |accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Karissa |last=Giuliano |title=The 10 Most Popular Celebrities on Facebook |publisher=CNBC |date=9 June 2015 |url=http://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/09/the-10-most-popular-celebrities-on-facebook.html |accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2014 survey by sports research firm Repucom in 15 international markets, Messi was familiar to 87% of respondents around the world, of whom 78% perceived him favourably, making him the second-most recognised player globally, behind Ronaldo, and the most likable of all contemporary players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Borg |title=Ballon D'Or: Lionel Messi vs. Cristiano Ronaldo – Battle of the Brands |publisher=CNN |date=2 December 2014 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/01/sport/football/lionel-messi-cristiano-ronaldo-barcelona-real-madrid-ballon-dor-marketing-merchandise-facebook/ |accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 10 Most Marketable Footballers in the World |publisher=Repucom (press release) |date=28 May 2014 |url=http://repucom.net/wp-content/uploads/Top-10-Most-Marketable-Football-Players.pdf |accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other events have illustrated Messi's presence in popular culture. A solid gold replica of his left foot, weighing {{convert|25|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and valued at $5.25&amp;nbsp;million, went on sale in Japan in March 2013 to raise funds for victims of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Messi's Left Foot – Yours for $5.25 Million |publisher=CNN |date=6 March 2013 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/06/sport/football/football-leo-messi-golden-foot/ |accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 Turkish Airlines advertisement starring Messi, in which he engages in a [[selfie]] competition with then-[[Los Angeles Lakers]] star [[Kobe Bryant]], was the most-watched ad on [[YouTube]] in the year of its release, receiving 137&amp;nbsp;million views, and was subsequently voted the best advertisement of the 2005–15 decade to commemorate YouTube's founding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Kaitlyn |last=Krasselt |title=Cannes to Cannes: YouTube's Most Viewed Ads |journal=USA Today |date=21 June 2014 |url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/06/21/cannes-youtube-top-ads/10891397/ |accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Laura |last=Lorenzetti |title=YouTube Users Say This Is the 'Ad of the Decade' |journal=Time |date=3 June 2015 |url=http://time.com/3908087/youtube-ad-of-the-decade/ |accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World Press Photo]] selected &quot;The Final Game&quot;, a photograph of Messi facing the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy|World Cup trophy]] after Argentina's final defeat to Germany, as the best sports image of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Best Sports Photo of the Year Goes To...

==Personal life==

===Family and relationships===
Since 2008, when he was 20, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonella Roccuzzo, a fellow native of [[Rosario]]. He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his best friend since childhood, [[Lucas Scaglia]], who is also a football player. After keeping their relationship private for a year, Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in [[Sitges]] after the Barcelona–Espanyol derby. He had previously been romantically linked with Argentine models Macarena Lemos and [[Luciana Salazar]].{{sfn|Caioli|2012|pp=196–197}}

[[File:Cristina Fernández y la Selección Argentina de fútbol 2014 ,3 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Messi pictured in July 2014]]

Messi and Roccuzzo have two sons: Thiago (born 2012) and Mateo (born 2015). To celebrate his partner's first pregnancy, Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina's 4–0 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Messi Shares Baby Joy |publisher=beIN Sports |date=17 June 2012 |url=http://www.beinsports.tv/news/title/messi-shares-baby-joy/article/3my803vek9sw1ky0beeucau3b |archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:-lZWZO2a5XMJ:www.beinsports.tv/news/title/messi-shares-baby-joy/article/3my803vek9sw1ky0beeucau3b&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=nl&amp;strip=1&amp;vwsrc=0 |archivedate=19 August 2015 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012, with Messi attending the birth after being given permission by Barcelona to miss training. He announced his son's arrival on his Facebook page, writing, &quot;Today I am the happiest man in the world, my son was born and thanks to God for this gift!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Messi Junior Named Thiago |publisher=ESPN FC |date=2 November 2012 |url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/1211817/messi-becomes-a-father-son-named-thiago |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thiago's name and handprints are tattooed on his left calf.{{sfn|Caioli|2015|loc=ch. 38}} In April 2015, Messi confirmed on Facebook that they were expecting another child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lionel Messi's Wife Expecting Second Child, Barcelona Star Says |publisher=ESPN FC |date=30 April 2015 |url=http://www.espnfc.com/barcelona/story/2426028/lionel-messis-wife-expecting-second-child-barca-star-says |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He missed training ahead of a match against Atlético Madrid to attend the birth of his second son, Mateo, on 11 September 2015 in Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Messi's Brother Confirms Birth of Barcelona Star's Second Child |journal=FourFourTwo |date=11 September 2015 |url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/messis-brother-confirms-birth-barcelona-stars-second-child |accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Messi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members, particularly his mother, Celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Matías, manage his charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=31, 143, 570}}

Since leaving for Spain at age 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family's old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of &quot;The Machine of '87&quot; at Newell's Old Boys. Although considered a [[List of one-club men|one-club man]], he has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell's. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell's embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son.&lt;ref name=&quot;Here and Gone&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=576–577}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Wright |title=After Just 72 Hours on the Planet, Thiago Messi Signs for Newell's Old Boys |publisher=ESPN FC |date=5 November 2012 |url=http://www.espnfc.com/blog/the-toe-poke/65/post/1850358/after-just-72-hours-on-the-planet-thiago-messi-signs-for-newells-old-boys |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charity===
Throughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the [[UNICEF|United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leo Messi: Goodwill Ambassador&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Leo Messi: Goodwill Ambassador |publisher=UNICEF |date=25 May 2012 |url=http://www.unicef.org/people/people_52964.html |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Iain |last=Rogers |first2=Justin|last2=Palmer |title=Barcelona Extend UNICEF Shirt Deal to 2016 |publisher=Reuters |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/12/us-soccer-spain-barcelona-unicef-idUSBRE9AB0NZ20131112 |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Messi has served as a [[List of UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors|UNICEF goodwill ambassador]] since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children in the wake of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|recent earthquake]]. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Leo Messi Activity Highlights |publisher=UNICEF |date=14 May 2015 |url=http://www.unicef.org/people/people_52965.html |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Leo Messi's Son Turns One and Celebrates with UNICEF |publisher=UNICEF (press release) |date=28 October 2013 |url=http://www.unicef.org/media/media_70751.html |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lionel Messi Fast Facts |publisher=CNN |date=25 June 2015 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/07/08/world/europe/lionel-messi-fast-facts/ |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=576–577}} Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere in the world.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=576–577}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ooredoo, Messi Foundation Continue Expansion: Three New Mobile Health Clinics Launched in Algeria |newspaper=Arab Times |date=3 August 2015 |url=http://www.arabtimesonline.com/ooredoo-messi-foundation-continue-expansion/ |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his own fundraising activities, such as his global &quot;Messi and Friends&quot; football matches, his foundation receives financial support from various companies to which he has assigned his name in endorsement agreements, with Adidas as their main sponsor.&lt;ref name=&quot;'Lionel Messi and Friends' Soccer Tour Is One of Many Causes Argentine Superstar Supports&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title='Lionel Messi and Friends' Soccer Tour Is One of Many Causes Argentine Superstar Supports |publisher=New England Sports Network |date=22 June 2012 |url=http://nesn.com/2012/06/lionel-messi-and-friends-soccer-tour-is-one-of-many-causes-argentine-superstar-supports/ |accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Partners |publisher=Leo Messi Foundation |url=http://www.fundacionleomessi.org/nuestros-partners/ |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Messi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell's Old Boys and rival club [[Rosario Central]], as well as at [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] and [[Boca Juniors]] in Buenos Aires.{{sfn|Balagué|2013|pp=576–577}} At Newell's Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club's [[Estadio Marcelo Bielsa|stadium]] for their youth academy. His former youth coach at Newell's, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players.&lt;ref name=&quot;Here and Gone&quot;/&gt; On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against [[La Razón (Madrid)|''La Razón'' newspaper]] and was awarded €65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors without Borders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/spanish-primera-division/story/2887818/argentinas-lionel-messi-wins-libel-case-and-donates-damages-to-charity|title=Argentina's Lionel Messi wins libel case, donates damages to charity|publisher=ESPN FC|date=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/messi-wins-case-against-razon-newspaper-5185823|title=Messi wins a case against 'La Razon' newspaper|publisher=Sport|date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal issues===
Messi's financial affairs came under investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion. Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were allegedly used to evade €4.1&amp;nbsp;million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama, set up in 2012, was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the [[Panama Papers]] data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of €5.1&amp;nbsp;million in August 2013. He stood trial alongside his father on three counts of tax evasion in May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mauritius |last=Much |first2=Bastian |last2=Obermayer |title=The Small Kaiser |newspaper=Süddeutsche Zeitung |date=5 April 2016 |url=http://panamapapers.sueddeutsche.de/articles/57021852a1bb8d3c3495b438/ |accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed [[Suspended sentence|suspended]] 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay €1.7&amp;nbsp;million and €1.4&amp;nbsp;million in fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2016/07/06/lionel-messi-tax-fraud-prison-jail-sentence |title=Messi, father guilty of tax fraud, given suspended 21-month sentences |work=SI.com|date=6 July 2016 |accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the District Attorney did not consider there to be motives to accuse Messi, the state lawyer's office became the only party that requested a punishment for him, despite his declarations that he was not aware of any of the deals that were taking place with his money. Facing the [[judge]], he said, &quot;I just played football.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.espnfc.com/spanish-primera-division/story/2884966/barcelonas-lionel-messi-in-tax-court-i-played-football-and-trusted-my-dad|title=Barcelona's Lionel Messi in tax court: I played football and trusted my father|work=ESPN FC|date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Game of Thrones''''' is an American &lt;!--Awards/nominations do not go here--&gt; [[fantasy]]&lt;!-- Before adding a flavor of fantasy, such as high, epic or medieval fantasy, please cite a reliable source. --&gt; [[Drama (film and television)|drama]] television series created by [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]]. It is an adaptation of ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', [[George R. R. Martin]]'s series of fantasy novels, the first of which is ''[[A Game of Thrones]]''. It is filmed at Titanic Studios in [[Belfast]], on location in the United Kingdom, and in Croatia, Iceland, Malta, Morocco, Spain, and the United States. The series premiered on [[HBO]] in the United States on April 17, 2011, and its sixth season ended on June 26, 2016. The series was renewed for a seventh season, scheduled to premiere in mid-2017 with seven episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/07/18/game-thrones-season-7|title=Game of Thrones: HBO announces summer return, 7 episodes|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last=Hibberd|first=James|date=July 18, 2016|accessdate=July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series will conclude with its eighth season in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803001301/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-36934888 |archivedate=August 3, 2016 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-36934888|title=Game of Thrones to end after season eight in 2018|work=[[BBC News]]|date=July 30, 2016|accessdate=July 31, 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Set on the fictional continents of [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire|Westeros and Essos]], it has several plot lines and a large [[ensemble cast]]. The first [[story arc]] follows a dynastic conflict among competing claimants for succession to the [[Iron Throne (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Iron Throne]] of the [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire#Westeros|Seven Kingdoms]], with other noble families fighting for independence from the throne. The second covers attempts to reclaim the throne by the exiled last [[Lineal descendant|scion]] of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty; the third chronicles the threat of the impending winter and the legendary creatures and fierce peoples of the North.

''Game of Thrones'' has attracted record viewership on HBO and has a broad, active, international [[Fandom|fan base]]. It has been acclaimed by critics, particularly for its acting, complex characters, story, scope, and production values, although its frequent use of nudity and violence (including sexual violence) has attracted criticism.&lt;!-- See the &quot;critical reception&quot; section for references. The lead is a summary and as such is normally not footnoted. --&gt; The series has received 38 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, including [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|Outstanding Drama Series]] in 2015 and 2016, more than any other primetime scripted television series. Its [[List of awards and nominations received by Game of Thrones|other awards and nominations]] include three [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation|Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation]] (2012–2014), a 2011 [[Peabody Award]], and four nominations for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama]] (2012 and 2015–2017). Of the ensemble cast, [[Peter Dinklage]] has won two [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series|Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series]] (2011 and 2015) and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film]] (2012) for his performance as [[Tyrion Lannister]]. [[Lena Headey]], [[Emilia Clarke]], [[Kit Harington]], [[Maisie Williams]], [[Diana Rigg]], and [[Max von Sydow]] have also received Primetime Emmy Award nominations for their performances in the series.

[[Showrunner]] David Benioff jokingly suggested &quot;''[[The Sopranos]]'' in [[Middle-earth]]&quot; as  ''Game of Thrones''{{'}} [[tagline]], referring to its intrigue-filled plot and dark tone in a fantasy setting of magic and dragons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503185336/http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/47040/ |archivedate=May 3, 2016 |last=Kachka |first=Boris |title=Dungeon Master: David Benioff |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=May 18, 2008 |url= http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/47040/ |accessdate=March 13, 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2012 study of deaths per episode, it ranked second out of 40 recent U.S. TV drama series (with an average of 14).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629182833/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-thrones-spartacus-vengeance-deadliest-shows-327911 |archivedate=June 29, 2016 |title='Game of Thrones' Topped by 'Spartacus: Vengeance' as TV's Deadliest Series| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-thrones-spartacus-vengeance-deadliest-shows-327911|accessdate=May 23, 2012|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=May 22, 2012| first=Michael| last=O'Connell|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He introduced gray tones into a black-and-white universe.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;themes&quot;/&gt;

A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between [[good and evil]], which Martin says does not mirror the real world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gevers |first=Nick |authorlink=Nick Gevers |url=http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/intgrrm.htm |title=Sunsets of High Renown – An Interview with George R.

Main characters are regularly killed off, and this has been credited with developing tension among viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;themes&quot;/&gt; The series also reflect the substantial death rates in war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kirschling |first=Gregory |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20161804,00.html |title=George R.R.

===Inspirations and derivations===
Although the first season is a faithful adaptation of the novel, later seasons have significant changes. According to David Benioff, the show is &quot;about adapting the series as a whole and following the map George laid out for us and hitting the major milestones, but not necessarily each of the stops along the way&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430065802/http://www.ew.com/article/2015/03/17/game-thrones-showrunners |archivedate=April 30, 2016 |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/03/17/game-thrones-showrunners |title=Game of Thrones showrunners answer burning season 5 questions |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |first=James |last=Hibberd |date=March 17, 2015 |accessdate=March 18, 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord [[Ned Stark|Eddard &quot;Ned&quot; Stark]] ([[Sean Bean]]) is the head of House Stark, whose members are involved in most of the series' plot lines.

Across the Narrow Sea, siblings [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] ([[Harry Lloyd]]) and [[Daenerys Targaryen]] ([[Emilia Clarke]]) – the exiled children of the last king of the original ruling dynasty, who was overthrown by Robert Baratheon – are running for their lives and trying to win back the throne.

==Production==

===Conception and development===
[[File:D. B. Weiss and David Benioff.jpg|thumb|alt=D. B. Weiss and David Benioff|Showrunners D. B. Weiss and David Benioff created the series, wrote most of its episodes and directed several.]]

In January 2006, George R. R. Martin's literary agent sent the first four books of ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' to David Benioff after a phone conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gzYfBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT15&amp;lpg=PT15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Inside HBO's Game of Thrones |first= Bryan |last= Cogman |publisher=Gollancz|date= November 6, 2014 |asin=B00P187U0Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Benioff read a few hundred pages of the first novel, ''A Game of Thrones'', shared his enthusiasm with D. B. Weiss and suggested that they adapt Martin's novels into a television series; Weiss finished the first novel in &quot;maybe 36 hours&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mitchell|first=Elvis|title=UpClose: Game of Thrones with David Benioff and D. B. Weiss (FULL LENGTH)|url=https://soundcloud.com/kcrw/upclose-game-of-thrones-with|accessdate=May 15, 2013|publisher=[[KCRW]]|date=May 8, 2013}} At about 2:50.&lt;/ref&gt; They [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] the series to HBO after a five-hour meeting with Martin (a veteran screenwriter) in a restaurant on [[Santa Monica Boulevard]]. According to Benioff, they won Martin over with their answer to his question, &quot;[[Jon Snow (character)#Parentage|Who is Jon Snow's mother?]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;variety 2&quot;/&gt; Asked about why they decided to turn the novels into an HBO show instead of a feature film, Benioff said that it would be impossible, considering that the scale of the novels is too big for a feature film and would mean dozen of characters would be discarded. Benioff also added, &quot;a fantasy movie of this scope, financed by a major studio, would almost certainly need a PG-13 rating. That means no sex, no blood, no profanity. Fuck that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;themes&quot;/&gt;

The series began development in January 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;var&quot;/&gt; HBO acquired the TV rights to the novels, and Benioff and Weiss were its executive producers. The intention was for each novel to yield a season's worth of episodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;var&quot;/&gt; Initially, Benioff and Weiss were to write every episode except one per season which was reserved for Martin (who was co-executive producer).&lt;ref name=&quot;var&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918180445/http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/32275-hello-from-benioff-and-weiss/page__st__40__p__1593863 |archivedate=September 18, 2013 |last=Benioff |first=David |author2=D.

Although many of the first-season cast were set to return, the producers had a large number of new characters to cast for the [[Game of Thrones (season 2)|second season]]. Due to this, Benioff and Weiss postponed the introduction of several key characters and merged several characters into one or assigned plot functions to different characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;hibberd1&quot;/&gt;

''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' author [[George R. R. Martin]] wrote one episode in each of the first four seasons. Martin did not write an episode for the fifth or sixth seasons, since he wanted to focus on completing the sixth novel (''[[The Winds of Winter]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/30/george-rr-martin-not-writing-game-of-thrones-season-6-episode |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/30/george-rr-martin-not-writing-game-of-thrones-season-6-episode |title=George R.

[[Bryan Cogman]], initially a script coordinator for the series,&lt;ref name=&quot;espenson&quot;/&gt; was promoted to producer for the fifth season. Cogman, who wrote at least one episode for the first five seasons, is the only other writer in the writers' room with Benioff and Weiss. Before his promotion, [[Vanessa Taylor]] (a writer during the second and third seasons) worked closely with Benioff and Weiss. [[Dave Hill (screenwriter)|Dave Hill]] joined the writing staff for the fifth season after working as an assistant to Benioff and Weiss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101102954/http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/game-of-thrones-benioff-weiss-interview |archivedate=January 1, 2015 |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/game-of-thrones-benioff-weiss-interview |title=The Surprising Connection Between ''Game of Thrones'' and ''Monty Python'' |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=March 24, 2014 |accessdate=September 7, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Martin is not in the writers' room, he reads the script outlines and makes comments.&lt;ref name=&quot;observer&quot;/&gt;

Benioff and Weiss sometimes assign characters to particular writers; for example, Cogman was assigned to Arya Stark for the fourth season. The writers spend several weeks writing a character outline, including what material from the novels to use and the overarching themes. After these individual outlines are complete, they spend another two to three weeks discussing each main character's individual arc and arranging them episode by episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;observer&quot;/&gt; A detailed outline is created, with each of the writers working on a portion to create a script for each episode. Cogman, who wrote two episodes for the fifth season, took a month and a half to complete both scripts. They are then read by Benioff and Weiss, who make notes, and parts of the script are rewritten. All ten episodes are written before filming begins, since they are filmed out of order with two [[film crew|units]] in different countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;observer&quot;/&gt;

===Adaptation schedule===
Benioff and Weiss intend to adapt the entire, still-incomplete ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series of novels for television. After ''Game of Thrones'' began outpacing the published novels in the sixth season, the series was based on a plot outline of the future novels provided by Martin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621094105/http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/03/game-of-thrones-tv-show-will-spoil-books |archivedate=June 21, 2016 |last=Robinson|first=Joanna|title=Game of Thrones Creators Confirm the Show Will Spoil the Books|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/03/game-of-thrones-tv-show-will-spoil-books|accessdate=March 23, 2015|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=March 22, 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and original content.

Principal photography for the first season was scheduled to begin on July 26, 2010,&lt;ref name=&quot;gotfactsheet&quot;/&gt; and the primary location was the [[The Paint Hall|Paint Hall Studios]] in [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430032117/http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/news/news-ofmdfm/news-ofmdfm-210409-hbo-to-film.htm |archivedate=April 30, 2016 |title= HBO to film TV pilot in Belfast, Northern Ireland |publisher=Northern Ireland Executive |date= April 21, 2009 |url=http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/news/news-ofmdfm/news-ofmdfm-210409-hbo-to-film.htm |accessdate=March 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exterior scenes in Northern Ireland were filmed at Sandy Brae in the [[Mourne Mountains]] (standing in for Vaes Dothrak), [[Castle Ward]] (Winterfell), Saintfield Estates (the Winterfell godswood), [[Tollymore Forest]] (outdoor scenes), [[Cairncastle]] (the execution site), the [[Magheramorne]] quarry (Castle Black) and [[Shane's Castle]] (the tourney grounds).&lt;ref name=&quot;USA Today March 30, 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120401123724/http://travel.usatoday.com/destinations/story/2012-04-01/Where-the-HBO-hit-Game-of-Thrones-was-filmed/53876876/1 |archivedate=April 1, 2012|url=http://travel.usatoday.com/destinations/story/2012-04-01/Where-the-HBO-hit-Game-of-Thrones-was-filmed/53876876/1 |title=Where HBO's hit 'Game of Thrones' was filmed |work=[[USA Today]] |first=Josh |last=Roberts |date=April 1, 2012 |accessdate=March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Doune Castle]] in [[Stirling]], Scotland, was also used in the original pilot episode for scenes at Winterfell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811101337/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/tayside_and_central/8322843.stm |archivedate=August 11, 2016 |title=Medieval keep becomes film set|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/tayside_and_central/8322843.stm|accessdate=April 11, 2012|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=October 23, 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The producers initially considered filming the whole series in Scotland, but decided on Northern Ireland because of the availability of studio space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529084634/http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/scotland-mourning-the-loss-of-epic-160m-tv-opportunity.21352049 |archivedate=May 29, 2015 |last=Miller|first=Phil|title=Beaten in Game of Thrones: why Scotland lost £160m chance to host TV series|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/scotland-mourning-the-loss-of-epic-160m-tv-opportunity.21352049|accessdate=June 17, 2013|newspaper=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]|date=June 17, 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first season's southern scenes were filmed in Malta, a change in location from the   pilot episode's Moroccan sets.&lt;ref name=&quot;gotfactsheet&quot;/&gt; The city of [[Mdina]] was used for King's Landing. Filming was also done at [[Fort Manoel]] (representing the Sept of Baelor); at the [[Azure Window]] on the island of [[Gozo]] (the Dothraki wedding site) and at [[San Anton Palace]], [[Fort Ricasoli]], [[Fort St Angelo]] and St. Dominic monastery (all used for scenes in the Red Keep).&lt;ref name=&quot;USA Today March 30, 2012&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Dubrovnik crop.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The walled city of Dubrovnik|The walled city of Dubrovnik became King's Landing in season two.]]
Filming of the second season's southern scenes shifted from Malta to Croatia, where the city of [[Dubrovnik]] and nearby locations allowed exterior shots of a walled, coastal  medieval city. The [[Walls of Dubrovnik]] and [[Fort Lovrijenac]] were used for scenes in King's Landing and the Red Keep. The island of [[Lokrum]], the St. Dominic monastery in the coastal town of [[Trogir]], the [[Rector's Palace, Dubrovnik|Rector's Palace]] in Dubrovnik, and the Dubac quarry (a few kilometers east) were used for scenes set in Qarth. Scenes set north of the Wall, in the Frostfangs and at the Fist of the First Men, were filmed in November 2011 in Iceland: on the [[Vatnajökull]] glacier near Smyrlabjörg, the Svínafellsjökull glacier near [[Skaftafell]] and the [[Mýrdalsjökull]] glacier near [[Vík í Mýrdal|Vik]] on Höfðabrekkuheiði.&lt;ref name=&quot;USA Today March 30, 2012&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;location iceland&quot;&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826083416/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/iceland/articles/game-of-thrones-iceland-tour-filming-locations/ |archivedate=August 26, 2016 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/iceland/articles/game-of-thrones-iceland-tour-filming-locations/ |title=Iceland's most spectacular Game of Thrones filming locations |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |first= Oliver|last= Smith |date=June 7, 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third-season production returned to Dubrovnik, with the Walls of Dubrovnik, Fort Lovrijenac and nearby locations again used for scenes in King's Landing and the Red Keep.

===Directing===
{{see also|List of Game of Thrones directors}}
Each ten-episode season of ''Game of Thrones'' has four to six directors, who usually direct back-to-back episodes. [[Alex Graves]], [[David Nutter]], and [[Alan Taylor (director)|Alan Taylor]] have directed the most episodes of the series, with six each. [[Daniel Minahan]] directed five episodes, and [[Michelle MacLaren]], [[Mark Mylod]], [[Jeremy Podeswa]], [[Alik Sakharov]], and [[Miguel Sapochnik]] directed four each. [[Brian Kirk]] directed three episodes during the first season, and [[Tim Van Patten]] directed the series' first two episodes. [[Neil Marshall]] directed two episodes, both with large battle scenes: &quot;[[Blackwater (Game of Thrones)|Blackwater]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Watchers on the Wall]]&quot;. Other directors have been [[Jack Bender]], [[David Petrarca]], [[Daniel Sackheim]] and [[Michael Slovis]]. [[Matt Shakman]] will direct at least one episode of the upcoming seventh season.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.ew.com game-thrones-season-7&quot;&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/06/29/game-thrones-season-7 |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/06/29/game-thrones-season-7|title=Game of Thrones season 7 directors revealed|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last=Hibberd|first=James|date=June 29, 2016|accessdate=June 29, 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Benioff and D.

===Technical aspects===
[[Alik Sakharov]] was the pilot's cinematographer. The series has had a number of cinematographers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinematographers.nl/PaginasDoPh/sakharov.htm |title=ALIK SAKHAROV ASC |publisher=Cinematographers |accessdate=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has received seven [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series]] nominations.&lt;ref name=&quot;emmys.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/game-thrones |title=Game of Thrones |publisher=[[Emmy Award|Emmys.com]] |accessdate=February 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oral Norrey Ottey, Frances Parker, Martin Nicholson, Crispin Green, [[Tim Porter]] and Katie Weiland have edited the series for a varying number of episodes. Weiland received a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series|Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series]] in 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;emmys.com&quot;/&gt;

[[Michele Clapton]] was [[costume designer]] for ''Game of Thrones''{{'}} first five seasons before she was replaced by [[April Ferry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-thrones-costume-designer-april-803895 |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-thrones-costume-designer-april-803895 |title='Game of Thrones' Season 6 Adds New Costume Designer |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first=Merle |last=Ginsberg |date=June 19, 2015 |accessdate=December 13, 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clapton will return to the show as costume designer for the seventh season.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.ew.com game-thrones-season-7&quot;/&gt;

The series' costumes are inspired by a number of cultures, including medieval [[Japanese armor|Japan]] and [[Persian clothing|Persia]]. Dothraki dress resembles that of the [[Bedouin]] (one was made out of fish skins to resemble dragon scales), and the Wildlings wear animal skins like the [[Inuit]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wischhover20120604&quot;&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://fashionista.com/2012/06/game-of-thrones-hair-and-wardrobe-secrets-revealed/ |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |url=http://fashionista.com/2012/06/game-of-thrones-hair-and-wardrobe-secrets-revealed/ |title=Game of Thrones' Hair and Wardrobe Secrets Revealed |work=Fashionista |date=June 4, 2012 |accessdate=June 6, 2012 |author=Wischhover, Cheryl|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wildling bone armor is made from molds of actual bones, and is assembled with string and latex resembling [[catgut]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Snead, Elizabeth&quot;&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fash-track/game-thrones-michelle-clapton-costume-designer-emmy-335607 |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fash-track/game-thrones-michelle-clapton-costume-designer-emmy-335607 |title='Game of Thrones' Designer Michelle Clapton's Secret Source for Wildling Bones: eBay |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=June 11, 2012 |accessdate=June 11, 2012 |author=Snead, Elizabeth|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the extras who play Wildlings and the Night's Watch often wear hats (normal in a cold climate), members of the principal cast usually do not so viewers can distinguish the main characters. [[Björk]]'s [[Alexander McQueen]] high-neckline dresses inspired [[Margaery Tyrell]]'s funnel-neck outfit, and prostitutes' dresses are designed for easy removal.&lt;ref name=&quot;wischhover20120604&quot; /&gt; All clothing is aged for two weeks so it appears realistic on high-definition television.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snead, Elizabeth&quot;/&gt;

About two dozen wigs are used for the actresses. Made of human hair and up to {{convert|2|ft|cm}} in length, they cost up to $7,000 each and are washed and styled like real hair. Applying the wigs is time-consuming; [[Emilia Clarke]], for example, requires about two hours to style her brunette hair with a platinum-blonde wig and braids. Other actors, such as [[Jack Gleeson]] and [[Sophie Turner (actress)|Sophie Turner]], receive frequent [[hair coloring]]. For characters such as Daenerys (Clarke) and her Dothraki, their hair, wigs and costumes are processed to appear as if they have not been washed for weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;wischhover20120604&quot;/&gt;

===Makeup===
For the first three seasons, [[Paul Engelen]] was ''Game of Thrones''{{'}} main makeup designer and [[Prosthetic makeup|prosthetic makeup artist]] with Melissa Lackersteen, [[Conor O'Sullivan (make-up artist)|Conor O'Sullivan]] and Rob Trenton. At the beginning of the fourth season Engelen's team was replaced by Jane Walker and her crew, composed of Ann McEwan and Barrie and Sarah Gower.&lt;ref name=&quot;emmys.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://www.westeros.org/GoT/News/Entry/Game_of_Thrones_Wins_Big_at_Creative_Arts_Emmys/ |archivedate=August 21, 2016|url=http://www.westeros.org/GoT/News/Entry/Game_of_Thrones_Wins_Big_at_Creative_Arts_Emmys/|title=Game of Thrones Wins Big at Creative Arts Emmys|work=Westeros.org|date=September 16, 2012|accessdate=February 21, 2016|author=Elio|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual effects===
For the series' large number of [[visual effects]], HBO hired British-based BlueBolt and Irish-based Screen Scene for season one. Most of the environment builds were done as [[2.5D]] projections, giving viewers perspective while keeping the programming from being overwhelming.&lt;ref name=vfx-got&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://www.westeros.org/GoT/Features/Entry/Interview_with_VFX_Producer_Lucy_Ainsworth-Taylor/ |archivedate=August 21, 2016|last1=Elio|title=Interview with VFX Producer Lucy Ainsworth-Taylor|url=http://www.westeros.org/GoT/Features/Entry/Interview_with_VFX_Producer_Lucy_Ainsworth-Taylor/|publisher=Westeros.org|date=June 22, 2011|accessdate=August 18, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the season-one finale, &quot;[[Fire and Blood (Game of Thrones)|Fire and Blood]]&quot;, was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects|Outstanding Special Visual Effects]].&lt;ref name=&quot;emmys.com&quot;/&gt;

Because the effects became more complex in subsequent seasons (including [[Computer graphics|CGI]] creatures, fire, and water), German-based [[Pixomondo]] became the lead visual-effects producer; nine of its twelve facilities contributed to the project for season two, with [[Stuttgart]] the lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://www.pixomondo.com/portfolio/game-of-thrones/ |archivedate=August 21, 2016|title=Game of Thrones: Season 2|url=http://www.pixomondo.com/portfolio/game-of-thrones/|publisher=[[Pixomondo]]|accessdate=August 19, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://www.pixomondo.com/portfolio/game-of-thrones-season-3/ |archivedate=August 21, 2016|title=Game of Thrones: Season 3|url=http://www.pixomondo.com/portfolio/game-of-thrones-season-3/|publisher=Pixomondo|accessdate=August 19, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scenes were also produced by British-based Peanut FX, Canadian-based Spin VFX, and U.S.-based Gradient Effects. &quot;[[Valar Morghulis]]&quot; and &quot;[[Valar Dohaeris]]&quot; earned Pixomondo Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Special Visual Effects in 2012 and 2013, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;emmys.com&quot;/&gt;

For season four, HBO added German-based Mackevision to the project.&lt;ref name=mckvsn&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821120407/http://mackevision.com/123live-user-data/user_data/6084/public/DOWNLOADS_DE/HOME/20140710_GOT_Nominierung_de.pdf |archivedate=August 21, 2014 |title=Mackevision erhält Emmy-Nominierung für visuelle Effekte in &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; – Pressemeldung|url=http://mackevision.com/123live-user-data/user_data/6084/public/DOWNLOADS_DE/HOME/20140710_GOT_Nominierung_de.pdf|publisher=Mackevision|date=July 10, 2014|accessdate=August 19, 2014|language=German|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The season-four finale, &quot;[[The Children (Game of Thrones)|The Children]]&quot;, won the 2014 Emmy Award for Visual Effects. Additional producers for season four included Canadian-based [[Rodeo FX]], German-based [[Scanline VFX]] and U.S.-based [[BAKED FX]]. The muscle and wing movements of the adolescent dragons in seasons four and five were based largely on those of a chicken. Pixomondo retained a team of 22 to 30 people which focused on visualizing Daenerys Targaryen's dragons, with the average production time per season of 20 to 22 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/Game-of-thrones-dragons |archivedate=August 21, 2016|last=Johnson|first=Thomas|title=How 'Game of Thrones' creates its dragons|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/Game-of-thrones-dragons|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=April 12, 2015|date=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the fifth season, HBO added Canadian-based [[Image Engine]] and U.S.-based Crazy Horse Effects to its list of main visual-effects producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://image-engine.com/tv/game-of-thrones/ |title=Game of Thrones |publisher=Image Engine |accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chevfx.com/current-projects.php |title=Current Projects |publisher=Crazy Horse Effects |accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sound===
Unusual for a television series, the sound team receives a [[rough cut]] of a full season and approaches it as a ten-hour feature film. Although seasons one and two had different sound teams, one team has been in charge of sound since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asoundeffect.com/creating-the-fantastical-sound-of-game-of-thrones/|title=This is how the fantastical sound of Game Of Thrones is made|last=Andersen|first=Asbjoern|publisher=A Sound Effect|date=August 6, 2014|accessdate=August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the show's blood-and-gore sounds, the team often uses a [[Chamois leather|shammy]]. For dragon screams, mating tortoises and dolphin, seal, lion and bird sounds have been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506065202/http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/06/game-of-thrones-sound-effects |archivedate=May 6, 2016 |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/06/game-of-thrones-sound-effects|title=Game of Thrones: The Secrets Behind All the Stabbings, Screams, and Sex Scenes|last=Calautti|first=Katie|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=June 12, 2014|accessdate=August 6, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title sequence===
{{main article|Game of Thrones title sequence}}

The series' [[title sequence]] was created by production studio Elastic for HBO. [[Creative director]] [[Angus Wall]] and his collaborators received the 2011 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Design|Main Title Design]] for the sequence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/emmys-2011-game-thrones-title-233780 |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |last=Fernandez|first=Sofia M.|title=Emmys 2011: 'Game of Thrones' Title Sequence Gives Series Its First Emmy|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/emmys-2011-game-thrones-title-233780|accessdate=June 1, 2013|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=September 10, 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; which depicts a [[Raised-relief map|three-dimensional map]] of [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire|the series' fictional world]].

===Language===
{{main article|Languages of A Song of Ice and Fire}}

The Westerosi characters of ''Game of Thrones'' speak [[British English]], often (but not consistently) with the accent of the English region corresponding to the character's Westerosi region; [[Eddard Stark]] (Warden of the North) speaks in actor Sean Bean's native [[Yorkshire accent|northern accent]], and the southern lord Tywin Lannister speaks with a [[Received Pronunciation|southern accent]]. Characters foreign to Westeros often have a non-British accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://gawker.com/what-is-going-on-with-the-accents-in-game-of-thrones-485816507 |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |last=Read |first=Max |title=What Is Going on With the Accents in Game of Thrones? |url=http://gawker.com/what-is-going-on-with-the-accents-in-game-of-thrones-485816507 |accessdate=May 8, 2013 |newspaper=[[Gawker]] |date=May 6, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadcast===
''Game of Thrones'' is broadcast by [[HBO]] in the United States and by its local subsidiaries or other [[pay television]] services in other countries, at the same time as in the U.S. or weeks (or months) later. The series' broadcast in China on [[China Central Television|CCTV]], begun in 2014, was heavily edited to remove scenes of sex and violence in accordance with a Chinese practice of censoring Western TV series to prevent what the ''[[People's Daily]]'' calls &quot;negative effects and hidden security dangers&quot;. This resulted in viewer complaints about the incoherence of what remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1500897/game-thrones-premieres-cctv-viewers-call-it-edited-mess |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |last=Blum|first=Jeremy|title=Game of Thrones premieres on CCTV, viewers call it an edited 'mess'|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1500897/game-thrones-premieres-cctv-viewers-call-it-edited-mess|accessdate=May 4, 2014|newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=April 30, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcasters carrying ''Game of Thrones'' include [[Showcase (Australian TV channel)|Showcase]] in Australia; [[HBO Canada]], [[Super Écran]] and [[Showcase (Canadian TV channel)|Showcase]] in Canada; [[Soho (New Zealand)|SoHo]] and [[Prime (New Zealand)|Prime]] in New Zealand, and [[Sky Atlantic]] in the United Kingdom and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110802120407/http://www.winter-is-coming.net/features/international-airings |archivedate=August 2, 2011 |url=http://www.winter-is-coming.net/features/international-airings|title=International Game of Thrones airings|publisher=WinterIsComing.net|date=August 2, 2011|accessdate=October 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural influence===
Although ''Game of Thrones'' was dismissed by some critics before it began,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Guardian March 22, 2014&quot;/&gt; its success has been credited with an increase in the popularity of fantasy themes. On the eve of the [[Game of Thrones (season 2)|second season's]] premiere, a [[CNN.com]] blog post by Joel Williams read, &quot;After this weekend, you may be hard pressed to find someone who isn't a fan of some form of [[epic fantasy]]&quot; and cited [[Ian Bogost]] as saying that the series continues a trend of successful screen adaptations beginning with [[Peter Jackson]]'s 2001 [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] and the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]] establishing fantasy as a mass-market genre; they are &quot;[[gateway drugs]] to fantasy fan culture&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://geekout.blogs.cnn.com/2012/03/30/mainstream-finally-believes-fantasy-fans/ |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |last=Williams|first=Joel|title=Mainstream finally believes fantasy fans|url=http://geekout.blogs.cnn.com/2012/03/30/mainstream-finally-believes-fantasy-fans/|accessdate=April 5, 2012 |publisher=[[CNN]]|date=March 30, 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its success in the face of its genre was attributed by writers to a longing for escapism in popular culture, frequent female nudity and a skill in balancing lighthearted and serious topics (dragons and politics, for example) which provided it with a prestige enjoyed by conventional, top-tier drama series.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Guardian March 22, 2014&quot; /&gt;

The series' popularity increased [[A Song of Ice and Fire#Sales|sales of the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels]] (republished in tie-in editions), which remained at the top of bestseller lists for months. According to ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', ''Game of Thrones'' was a favorite of [[sitcom]] writers and the series has been referred to in other TV series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/21/game-of-thrones-modern-family-parks-and-rec-writers-on-why-they-love-the-hbo-drama.html |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |last=Lacob|first=Jace|title='Game of Thrones': 'Modern Family,' 'Parks and Rec' Writers on Why They Love the HBO Drama|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/21/game-of-thrones-modern-family-parks-and-rec-writers-on-why-they-love-the-hbo-drama.html|accessdate=September 27, 2012|newspaper=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=September 21, 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; With other fantasy series, it has been cited for an increase in the purchase (and abandonment) of [[huskies]] and other wolf-like dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/game-of-thrones-inspired-huskie-craze-goes-cold-as-owners-give-up-on-dogs-8431188.html |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |last=O'Brian|first=Liam|title=Game of Thrones inspired Huskie craze goes cold as owners give up on dogs|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/game-of-thrones-inspired-huskie-craze-goes-cold-as-owners-give-up-on-dogs-8431188.html|accessdate=March 10, 2013|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=December 26, 2012|location=London|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor|Use of sex and violence}}Sex and violence====
Despite its otherwise enthusiastic reception by critics, ''Game of Thrones'' has been criticized for the amount of female nudity, violence, and sexual violence (especially against women) it depicts, and for the manner in which it depicts these themes. ''[[The Atlantic]]'' called the series' &quot;tendency to ramp up the sex, violence, and—especially—sexual violence&quot; of the source material &quot;the defining weakness&quot; of the adaptation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlantic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/05/game-of-thrones-roundtable-season-5-episode-six-unbowed-unbent-unbroken/393503/ |archivedate=August 21, 2016|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/05/game-of-thrones-roundtable-season-5-episode-six-unbowed-unbent-unbroken/393503/|title=Game of Thrones: A Pointless Horror and a Ridiculous Fight|last=Kornhaber|first=Spencer|last2=Orr|first2=Christopher|last3=Sullivan|first3=Amy|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=May 17, 2015|accessdate=May 18, 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; HBO's head of programming said in 2016 that &quot;[the] violence is not just specific to women, it’s men and women.

The amount of sex and nudity in the series, especially in scenes that are incidental to the plot, was the focus of much of the criticism aimed at the series in its [[Game of Thrones (season 1)|first]] and [[Game of Thrones (season 2)|second seasons]]. [[Stephen Dillane]], who portrays [[Stannis Baratheon]], likened the series' frequent explicit scenes to &quot;German porn from the 1970s&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/01/14/game-of-thrones-stephen-dillane-the-tunnel_n_4595628.html |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |last=Frost|first=Caroline|title='Game of Thrones' Star Stephen Dillane Admits the Nudity Is Like 'German Porn from the 1970s'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/01/14/game-of-thrones-stephen-dillane-the-tunnel_n_4595628.html|accessdate=January 16, 2014|newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=January 14, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charlie Anders]] wrote in [[io9]] that while the first season was replete with light-hearted &quot;[[sexposition]]&quot;, the second season appeared to focus on distasteful, exploitative, and dehumanizing sex with little informational content.&lt;ref name=&quot;io9 2 May 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911064821/http://io9.com/5906540/is-game-of-thrones-gratiutious-sex-worse-than-the-gratuitous-violence |archivedate=September 11, 2015 |last=Anders|first=Charlie Jane|title=Is Game of Thrones' gratuitous sex worse than the gratuitous violence?|url=http://io9.com/5906540/is-game-of-thrones-gratiutious-sex-worse-than-the-gratuitous-violence|accessdate=May 2, 2012|work=[[io9]]|date=May 2, 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'''s Anna Holmes, the nude scenes appeared to be aimed mainly at titillating heterosexual men, right down to the Brazilian waxes sported by the women in the series' faux-medieval setting, which made these scenes alienating to other viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holmes|first=Anna|title=Skin is wearing thin on HBO's 'Game of Thrones'|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/skin-is-wearing-thin-on-hbos-game-of-thrones/2012/04/26/gIQA4hd6jT_story_1.html|accessdate=May 2, 2012|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Huffington Post]]''{{'}}s Maureen Ryan likewise noted that ''Game of Thrones'' mostly presented women naked, rather than men, and that the excess of &quot;random boobage&quot; undercut any aspirations the series might have to address the oppression of women in a feudal society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502120407/http://www.aoltv.com/2011/05/29/game-of-thrones-season-1-episode-7-recap/ |archivedate=May 2, 2012 |last=Ryan|first=Maureen|title='Game of Thrones' Season 1, Episode 7 Recap|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2011/05/29/game-of-thrones-season-1-episode-7-recap/|accessdate=May 2, 2012|publisher=[[AOL TV]]|date=May 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' parodied this aspect of the adaptation in a sketch that portrayed the series as retaining a thirteen-year-old boy as a consultant whose main concern was showing as many breasts as possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;io9 2 May 2012&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://gawker.com/5902076/snl-explains-the-nudity-in-game-of-thrones |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |last=Toder |first=Matt |title=SNL Explains the Nudity in Game of Thrones |url=http://gawker.com/5902076/snl-explains-the-nudity-in-game-of-thrones |accessdate=May 2, 2012 |publisher=Gawker |date=April 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Game of Thrones (season 3)|third season]], which saw [[Theon Greyjoy]] lengthily tortured and eventually [[emasculated]], the series was also criticized for its use of torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/05/-i-game-of-thrones-i-worst-scene-yet/275772/ |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |last=Orr|first=Christopher|title=Game of Thrones' Worst Scene Yet?|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/05/-i-game-of-thrones-i-worst-scene-yet/275772/|accessdate=May 19, 2013|newspaper=[[The Atlantic]]|date=May 13, 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]] called the scene &quot;[[torture porn]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/05/game-of-thrones-couple-of-the-week-episode-6.html |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/05/game-of-thrones-couple-of-the-week-episode-6.html |title=''Game of Thrones'' Couple of the Week: Tyrion and Shae Are Never Getting Back Together |first=Allison P. |last=David |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=May 12, 2014 |accessdate=July 17, 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madeleine Davies of ''[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]'' agreed, saying, &quot;it's not uncommon that ''Game of Thrones'' gets accused of being torture porn — senseless, [[objectification|objectifying]] violence combined with senseless, objectifying sexual imagery.&quot; According to Davies, although the series' violence tended to serve a narrative purpose, Theon's torture in &quot;[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair#In the North|The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]&quot; was excessive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Davis|first=Madeleine|title=Game of Boners: This Is Torture Porn|url=http://jezebel.com/game-of-boners-this-is-torture-porn-504821180|accessdate=May 17, 2013|newspaper=Jezebel|date=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Breaker of Chains#Rape scene|A scene]] in the [[Game of Thrones (season 4)|fourth season's]] episode &quot;[[Breaker of Chains]]&quot;, in which [[Jaime Lannister]] rapes his sister and lover [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], triggered a broad public discussion about the series' depiction of sexual violence against women. According to Dave Itzkoff of the ''[[New York Times]]'', the scene caused outrage, in part because of comments by director [[Alex Graves]] that the scene became &quot;consensual by the end&quot;.

===Possible spinoff===
In November 2016, HBO's President of Programming Casey Bloys indicated that he had had preliminary discussions about a prequel spinoff to the ''Game of Thrones'' series with [[George R.R.

We’re going to do that while at the same time parallel processing very embryonic stages of other possibilities,&quot; he told ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hbo-ceo-richard-plepler-talks-game-thrones-prospects-international-growth-956419|title=HBO CEO Richard Plepler Talks 'Game of Thrones' Prospects and International Growth|first=Pamela|last=Rolfe|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=December 15, 2016|accessdate=December 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
