'''Stephen R. Donaldson''' (* [[13. Mai]] [[1947]] in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]) ist ein [[Vereinigte Staaten von Amerika|US-amerikanischer]] [[Fantasy-Autor|Fantasy-]] und [[Science-Fiction]]-Autor.

Stephen Reeder Donaldson verbrachte auf Grund der [[Missionar]]s&lt;nowiki /&gt;tätigkeit seiner Eltern einen großen Teil seiner Kindheit ab 1950 in [[Indien]] und kehrte erst 1963 in die Vereinigten Staaten zurück. 1968 machte er seinen Abschluss am [[College of Wooster]], Ohio, und arbeitete während des [[Vietnamkrieg]]s zwei Jahre lang als [[Kriegsdienstverweigerer]] in einem Krankenhaus. Später setzte er sein Studium an der [[Kent State University]] fort und erhielt 1971 seinen [[Magister]] im Fach Englisch. Sein folgendes [[Promotion (Doktor)|Promotionsstudium]] brach er vorzeitig ab, um sich ganz dem Schreiben zu widmen. Erst 1993 promovierte er doch noch zum Doktor der Literatur. 1994 erwarb er den Schwarzen Gürtel in [[Shōtōkan]]-Karate.

== Werk ==

=== Die Chroniken von Thomas Covenant (dem Zweifler) ===
Donaldsons 1977 erschienenes Erstlingswerk ''Lord Fouls Fluch'' (''Lord Foul's Bane'') wurde zum Überraschungsbestseller (nachdem es siebenundvierzigmal abgelehnt worden war, weil der Protagonist zu negativ sei). Es bildete den Auftakt zu den »Chroniken von Thomas Covenant dem Zweifler«. Inspiriert wurde Donaldson zu der Figur seines [[lepra]]kranken [[Antiheld]]en durch die Arbeit seines Vaters, der als Arzt in Indien auf die Arbeit mit Leprotikern spezialisiert war und der sich vor allem auch mit den psychischen Konsequenzen dieser Erkrankung auseinandersetzte.

»Die Chroniken« wurden von einigen Kritikern mit [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkiens]] ''[[Der Herr der Ringe]]'' verglichen. Ähnlich wie in Tolkiens Werk ist eine normale, eher schwache Person damit konfrontiert, durch den Besitz eines magischen Rings über große Macht zu verfügen. Donaldson erweitert allerdings das Thema um Aspekte moderner Psychologie und zeichnet Charaktere, die wesentlich ambivalenter wirken als die Tolkiens. Neben dem Ring- bzw. Machtkomplex und dessen Korruptionsproblematik untersucht Donaldson ausführlich das Thema des »[[Aussatz]]es« – des Ausgestoßenseins von Kranken aus der Gesellschaft. Die Titelgestalt des Buches, der Schriftsteller Thomas Covenant, ist an der [[Lepra]] erkrankt und wird daraufhin von seiner Umgebung voller Abscheu gemieden und angefeindet. Während kurzer Phasen von Besinnungslosigkeit lebt er monatelang in einer »Das Land« genannten [[Parallelwelt]], die stark an Tolkiens [[Tolkiensches Universum|Mittelerde]] erinnert. Dort ist seine Lepra kein Problem und sein [[Weißgold]]-Ehering ein [[Talisman]] von unermesslicher Macht.

The '''Z-car''' is a series of [[sports car]]s manufactured by [[Nissan Motors|Nissan Motors Ltd.]]. The original Z was sold in October 1969 in Japan as the '''Nissan Fairlady Z''' and was sold in Japan at [[Nissan#Japan|Nissan Exhibition]] dealerships that previously sold the [[Nissan Bluebird]]. It was exported as the Datsun 240Z.  Since 2009 Nissan has manufactured the newest Z, the [[Nissan 370Z]].

The earlier models of the Nissan Z were built at the [[Nissan Shatai]] plant in [[Hiratsuka, Kanagawa|Hiratsuka]] until 2000,  while the later models (350Z and 370Z) are built at [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Oppama]] (2002–2004) and [[Tochigi, Tochigi|Tochigi]] (2004–present). Enthusiasts praise the cars for their looks, reliability, performance, and affordability. Every Z car has been sold in Japan as the Fairlady Z and elsewhere under the names [[Nissan S30]], [[Nissan S130]], [[Nissan 300ZX]], [[Nissan 350Z]] and [[Nissan 370Z]].

==History==
[[File:NISSAN FAIRLADY Z Z34 logo.svg|thumb|left|Current wordmark for [[Nissan 370Z|Z34]].]]
Nissan was a relatively small automaker when it entered the international market in the 1960s and partnered with [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] to design a new sports car prototype to update the [[Nissan Fairlady]].  Nissan executives saw the prototype as a [[halo car]] that would improve their company's image in the minds of [[consumer]]s. By 1964 Nissan realized that Yamaha's DOHC 2.0-liter engine was not meeting Nissan's expectations and the project was scrapped. Yamaha later finished a [[prototype]] and took their design to Toyota, resulting in the [[Toyota 2000GT]].

[[Yutaka Katayama]], the president of Nissan USA at the time, realized the importance of an affordable sports car internationally. Nissan had already produced for many decades the successful series of [[Datsun Fairlady|Fairlady]] roadsters that competed mainly with English and Italian roadsters, and product planners envisioned a new line of [[Grand Tourer|GT]] cars that would be stylish, innovative, fast, and relatively inexpensive through the use of [[interchangeable parts]] with other Nissan vehicles. Nissan also had the engineering background and product development experience with the recently acquired [[Prince Motor Company]], which manufactured the [[Prince Skyline]] that was later renamed Nissan Skyline in 1966.

The [[240Z]] design project was carried out primarily by 10 people:
*Mr. [[Yutaka Katayama]] (President of Nissan USA, known as &quot;Mr. K&quot;)
*Mr. [[Teiichi Hara]] (Manager, Nissan Design and Development)
*Mr. [[Kazumi Yotsurnoto]] (Manager, Passenger Car Styling Section)
*Mr. [[Yoshihiko Matsuo]] (Chief of Design, Styling Studio #4)
*Mr. [[Akio Yoshida]] (Assistant Designer on Exterior Design)
*Mr. [[Sue Chiba]] (Interior Design)
*Mr. [[Eiichi Oiwa]] (Styling Studio Assistant)
*Mr. [[Kiichi Nishikawa]] (Styling Studio Assistant)
*Mr. [[Hidemi Kamahara]] (Design Engineer)
*Mr. [[Tsuneo Benitani]] (Design Engineer)

===First generation: Nissan 240Z (S30)===
:{{main|Nissan S30}}
[[File:Our Restored '71 Datsun 240Z (Right-Front View).jpg|thumb|Datsun 240Z (S30)]]
Sales of the Nissan Z Car started in October 1969 (for the 1970 model year), with separate versions for the [[Japan]]ese and US markets. The Japanese Fairlady Z featured a 2.0L [[Overhead cam#Single overhead camshaft|SOHC]] L20A [[inline-6]] producing {{convert|130|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, while the US 240Z featured a 2.4L L24 inline-6 with twin [[Hitachi]] [[SU Carburetter|SU-type]] [[carburetor]]s that produced {{convert|151|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} ([[Horsepower#SAE gross power|SAE gross horsepower]]). A third Z, the [[Nissan S30#Fairlady Z432|Z432 (PS30)]] shared a performance version of the [[Overhead cam#Double overhead camshaft|DOHC]] 2.0&amp;nbsp;L [[Nissan S20 engine|S20]] engine with the [[Nissan Skyline GT-R#1st generation (1969–1972)|Nissan Skyline 2000 GT-R]].

In Japan, the Z was still known as the Fairlady to keep the car in line with the previous generation [[Datsun Sports]] roadster. JDM versions had the Fairlady Z badge on the lower fenders with the 432 badge above (the 432 designation was 4 valves, 3 carburetors, and 2 camshafts).  However, Yutaka Katayama ensured the American version had all Nissan, Fairlady Z, and 432 badging replaced with &quot;[[Datsun]]&quot; and prevented all dealer shipments until they were replaced.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The 240Z was released in America on October 22, 1969.  Combining good looks, and powerful performance, it sold over 45,000 units through the '71 model year and over 50,000 and 40,000 in 1972 and 1973, respectively.

The 260Z was released in 1974; it featured an increased engine displacement of 2.6&amp;nbsp;L and an available [[2+2 (car body style)|2+2]] model with a slightly longer wheelbase. Despite the engine size increase, power decreased to {{convert|139|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} ([[Horsepower#SAE net power|SAE net horsepower]]) in most areas of the US due to new camshafts, carburetors, and lower compression that were introduced to comply with new emissions regulations. In other export regions the power was increased to {{convert|154|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.

The 280Z was released in 1975 in North America (not to be confused with the [[Nissan 280ZX|280ZX]], which is a second-generation Z-car) and featured another engine displacement enlargement to 2.8&amp;nbsp;L. A major change was the introduction of [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[fuel injection]], replacing the previous SU carburetors. This resulted in a power increase to {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} ([[Horsepower#SAE gross power|SAE gross horsepower]]), offsetting increased weight from added luxury features and an enlarged [[Bumper (automobile)|bumper]] that met US Federal regulations.  Export markets outside North America continued to receive the Datsun 260Z until the introduction of the Datsun 280ZX at the end of 1978.

===Second generation: Nissan 280ZX (S130)===
:{{main|Nissan S130}}
[[File:Nissan 280ZX Turbo.jpg|thumb|Nissan/Datsun 280ZX (S130)]]
Known as the Datsun/Nissan 280ZX in export markets, the car continued to use the &quot;Fairlady&quot; moniker in the Japanese domestic market where 2-litre inline-six engines were also available and was first introduced in 1978.

The only thing left unchanged from the previous 280Z was the 5-speed manual transmission and 2.8-liter L28 inline-6 engine, while the entire car overall was made more luxurious to meet growing consumer demands. Major changes for this new generation of Z-cars include [[t-top]]s, introduced in 1980, and a [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] model introduced in 1981, complementing the naturally aspirated (NA) 2-seater and NA 2+2 models. Coupled to either a 3-speed automatic or 5-speed manual transmission, the turbocharged model was capable of {{convert|180|bhp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|203|lbfft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque, over the {{convert|135|bhp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|144|lbfft|N.m|abbr=on}} of the NA engine.

Notable models include the 10th Anniversary Edition, featuring gold emblems, gold alloy wheels, and two-toned paint in either gold/red and black, with luxury features such as leather seats, headlamp washers, and automatic climate control.

The 280ZX was wildly popular, being hailed as [[Motor Trend]]'s [[Motor Trend Car of the Year#Import Car of the Year|Import Car of the Year]] for 1979 and going on to set a Z-car sales record of 86,007 units in its first year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/nissan-z-history4.htm|title=Datsun 280ZX - HowStuffWorks|work=HowStuffWorks}}&lt;/ref&gt; While on the one hand it received praise for taking the Z-car to further levels of comfort and performance, many enthusiasts also lamented the further emphasis on luxury over driving fun. This would continue with the third generation of Z-car, with a clean-sheet redesign that would take the Z-car to further heights.

===Third generation: Nissan 300ZX (Z31, First Model)===
:{{main|Nissan 300ZX}}
[[File:CleanZ31.jpg|thumb|Nissan 300ZX (Z31)]]
The Z-car was completely redesigned in 1984, and introduced Nissan's new series of 3.0-liter [[V6 engine]], dubbed the [[Nissan VG engine|VG]] series. The same engine was used in the Electramotive (later to become NPTI) [[Nissan GTP ZX-Turbo|GTP ZX-Turbo]] that dominated the IMSA GTP races in 1988 and 1989. These were available in both [[Nissan VG engine#VG30E|VG30E]] naturally aspirated and [[Nissan VG engine#VG30ET|VG30ET]] [[turbocharged]] forms producing 160 and 200&amp;nbsp;bhp (120 and 150&amp;nbsp;kW) respectively, although some VG30ET powered Z-cars exported outside of the US produced {{convert|228|bhp|abbr=on}} due to a longer cam duration and less emission restrictions. These were showcased in sleek new wedge-shaped styling and given a new name, the 300ZX. Like [[Nissan 280ZX|its predecessor]], it  proved to be wildly popular and was the second-best selling Z-car in history&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elfland.net/About/z/ztimeline.html&lt;/ref&gt; selling over 70,000 units due in part not only to its new styling but also to even more added luxury features and high performance. When the 300ZX Turbo was released in Japan, it offered the highest HP available in a Japanese standard production car at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vg30et.com/about.html VG30ET.com - About&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Much like the 280ZX that preceded it, the first-gen 300ZX was thought by enthusiasts as more GT than true sports car. It had improved handling, acceleration, and refinement than any previous model Z-car.

Nissan made various changes and claimed improvements to the Z31 model through its entire production.
In 1983 Nissan first offered the 300ZX in Japan. It was introduced in the US one year later. All US-market 1984 model Nissan vehicles carried both Datsun and Nissan nameplates. Along with the arrival of their new flagship sports coupe, Nissan launched an aggressive marketing campaign to promote the brand name change from Datsun to Nissan. The 1984 Models can technically be considered the only year of the &quot;Datsun 300ZX&quot;. The 1984 300ZX 50th Anniversary Edition was released in celebration of the company's 50th anniversary year. It was based on the standard 300ZX Turbo, but was outfitted with every luxury feature available, a unique black interior with &quot;bodysonic&quot; leather seats in addition to widened fender flares, requisite badging, rear quarter panel flares, and sixteen-inch (406&amp;nbsp;mm)  wheels (400&amp;nbsp;mm).&lt;ref&gt;[http://z31.com/misc/info/ae/ae.hist.shtml AE info&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 1985 model year, Nissan dropped the Datsun name brand for good, but the car dealers were still known as Datsun dealers.  Paul Newman raced in the 1985 GT1 Challenge and won. This was Newman's 4th national championship. Minor changes were made to the 300ZX including a water-cooled turbocharger and smoked taillights.

The 1986 model saw wider flared wheel wells as well as body-color bumpers, and the rear quarter panels were designed specifically to accommodate factory ground effect style side skirts. 1986 turbo models were equipped with an ordinary hood, markedly losing the turbo &quot;scoop&quot; on the driver's side.

In order to keep up with quickly aging aesthetics, another slight redesign happened in 1987, consisting of new rounded, restyled and longer front and rear bumpers, new headlights, and new tail lights. The black trim on turbo models was now a charcoal instead of gloss black, and 1987 Turbo models came with special &quot;smoked&quot; turbo-finned wheels. All 1987 model year turbo cars also received an upgraded manual transmission, larger and more powerful brakes, and turbo cars produced from 4/87 and later came equipped with a clutch-type limited-slip differential.

For the 1988 models, there were again a few small changes. The turbocharger was switched from the [[Garrett AiResearch|Garrett]] T3 turbo to a lower-inertia T25 turbo, and the engine from 7.8:1 to an 8.3:1 compression ratio in order to reduce turbocharger spool time and provide instant boost at any usable RPM. The interior aluminum accents and chrome door handles that adorned the earlier cars were dropped in favor of matching color parts. Another special edition, the &quot;Shiro Special&quot; (SS), was released in 1988. It was only available in pearl white (''shiro'' meaning &quot;white&quot; in Japanese).  The SS package consisted of analog gauges and climate controls with a black interior, stiffer sway bars, stiffer springs, non-adjustable suspension, special seats (Recaro), a viscous-coupling limited slip differential, and a special front lower lip spoiler.  This package had no options; all 88SS cars are identical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://z31.com/misc/info/ss/ The SS page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1989 Models are identical to 1988 models, though somewhat rare because of Nissan winding-down production early in preparation for the second generation 300ZX.

===Fourth generation: Nissan 300ZX (Z32, Second Model)===
:{{main|Nissan 300ZX}}
[[File:300ZX.jpg|thumb|Nissan 300ZX (Z32)]]
The only thing that remained unchanged from the previous generation 300ZX is the 3.0-liter [[V6 engine|V6]] engine, now with dual overhead camshafts (DOHC), [[variable valve timing]] (VVT) and producing a rated {{convert|222|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|198|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} in naturally aspirated form. The big news for enthusiasts, however, was the turbo variant, now upgraded with twin Garrett turbochargers and dual intercoolers. This was good for 300&amp;nbsp;hp (224&amp;nbsp;kW) along with {{convert|283|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twinturbo.net/ttnetfaq/stats/z32stats.html TwinTurbo.NET: Nissan 300ZX forum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Performance varied from 0-60 times of 5.0-6.0 seconds depending on the source, and it had a governed top speed of {{convert|155|mph|abbr=on}}.

Upon its release, the new 300ZX became an instant hit, winning [[Motor Trend]]'s [[Car of the Year|&quot;Import Car of the Year&quot;]] in 1990 as well as &quot;One of the Top Ten Performance Cars&quot;. [[Automobile Magazine]] honors the 300ZX/300ZX Turbo as its &quot;Design of the Year&quot; and adds it to their &quot;All Stars&quot; list. [[Road &amp; Track]] names the 300ZX Turbo &quot;One of the Ten Best Cars in the World&quot;, and [[Car and Driver]] adds it to their [[Car and Driver 10 Best|10Best]] for the seven years in which it was in production in America. American Z-car sales reached the one million sales mark in the 1990 model year.

[[Nissan]] utilized the [[Cray]]-II supercomputer to completely design the new 300ZX with a form of [[CAD software]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnthecopywriter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/300zx-Broch-copy.pdf Johnthecopywriter: 300ZX Brochure&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This made the 300ZX one of the first production cars to be developed in a [[CAD program]]. In return, it featured a whole host of technological advancements. On the twin turbo models, [[Steering#Four-wheel steering|four-wheel steering]] was available under the name [[HICAS|Super HICAS]] ''(High Capacity Actively Controlled Steering)''. The twin turbochargers, intercoolers, and requisite plumbing left for a cramped engine bay; however, everything fit perfectly.

Like previous generations Nissan offered a 2+2 model with the Z32. In 1993, a convertible version was introduced for the first time in the Z-car's history, as a response to aftermarket conversions. All 300ZXs now featured [[T-top]]s as standard, yet there were some rare hardtops (known as &quot;slicktops&quot;) produced as well.

The 300ZX was doomed to the same fate of many Japanese sports cars of the time. The mid-'90s trend toward [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]]s and the rising [[Yen]]:[[United States dollar|Dollar]] ratio were both influential in ending North American 300ZX sales in 1996 at over 80,000 units sold (production for other markets continued until 2000). Probably the biggest killer of the 300ZX was its ever-inflating price;{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} at its release it was priced at about $30,000, but in its final year this price had increased to around $50,000. This left many people questioning its value, and despite a final Commemorative Edition of the final 300 units shipped to America (complete with decals and certificates of authenticity), the Z-Car was on hiatus. In [[Japan]], however, the 300ZX lived on for a few more years with a face-lift including a new front fascia, tail lights, head lights, rear spoiler, and a few other minor changes.

===Nissan 240Z Concept (1999)===
[[File:Conceptz.jpg|thumb|Nissan 240Z Concept]]
In [[United States|America]] the Z-car went on hiatus from 1997 to 2002, as Nissan focused more on SUVs and was also in some financial trouble. To keep Z-car interest alive, Nissan launched a restoration program in 1998 for which they purchased original 240Zs, professionally restored them, and re-sold them at dealerships for about $24,000.

Nissan next launched a concept car at the 1999 [[North American International Auto Show]], the 240Z Concept. Clearly a throwback to the original, it was a bright orange two-seater with classic swept-back styling. In addition, it was fully functional, with the 2.4-liter 4-cylinder [[Nissan KA engine#KA24DE|KA24DE]] engine from the [[Nissan 240sx]] featuring {{convert|200|bhp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|180|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The designers used an original 240Z to provide inspiration and the concept was created in only 12 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theautochannel.com/news/press/date/19990105/press002119.html Nissan Z Concept Goes 'Back to Basics'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The running concept, featuring a 4-cylinder engine compared to the Z-car's traditional 6-cylinder engine, was eventually thought less than a worthy successor to the line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.300zx.cl/ga/300zx/images/zconcept.html Concept: The Nissan Z&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cars.com/carsapp/boston/?srv=parser&amp;act=display&amp;tf=/features/autoshow99/concept/nissan_2.tmpl|title=New Cars, Used Cars, Car Reviews - Cars.com|work=cars.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fifth generation: Nissan 350Z (Z33)===
:{{main|Nissan 350Z}}
[[File:Nissan 350Z flickr.jpg|thumb|Nissan 350Z (Z33)]]
In 1999 the French company [[Renault]] bought 44.4% of Nissan and [[Carlos Ghosn]] became its [[chief operating officer]].  But it would not be until 2001 when [[Carlos Ghosn]] became [[CEO]] that he would tell reporters: &quot;We will build the ''Z''. And we will make it profitable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roadandtrack.com/article.asp?section_id=6&amp;article_id=18 ROADandTRACK.com - First Drives - 2003 Nissan 350Z (12/2001)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927005313/http://www.roadandtrack.com/article.asp?section_id=6&amp;article_id=18 |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 8, 2001, [[Nissan]] introduced the Z Concept. Much like the previous Z concept, it debuted at the [[North American International Auto Show]] and was painted a bright orange. The squat, long-hood/short-deck styling resulted from a competition between [[Nissan]]'s Japanese, European, and American design studios, with the [[La Jolla]], [[California]] studio's design being chosen in March 2000. The product planners hoped to avoid the price problems that plagued the last few years of the [[Nissan 300ZX|300ZX]] with a target [[suggested retail price|MSRP]] of $30,000 while using the [[Porsche Boxster]] as a benchmark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caranddriver.com/previews/3115/2003-nissan-z.html 2003 Nissan Z - First Drive Review / Japanese Performance / High Performance / Hot Lists / Reviews / Car and Driver - Car And Driver&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2002, the [[Nissan 350Z|350Z]] was released to wide acclaim. It employed a slightly improved version of the 3.5-liter [[Nissan VQ engine#VQ35DE|VQ35DE]] DOHC V6 engine found in multiple [[Nissan]] cars at the time, including the [[Nissan Skyline#V35/CPV35|Skyline]] and [[Nissan Pathfinder|Pathfinder]]. Released on July 2002 in Japan at reorganized Nissan Japanese dealerships called ''[[Nissan Motor Company#Japan|Nissan Blue Stage]]'', and August 20, 2002 in the U.S., the 350Z coupé was available in 5 trim packages: '350Z' (Base), 'Enthusiast', 'Performance', 'Touring', and 'Track' editions. In Europe, only the 'Track' trim was available, although it was badged and marketed as '350Z'. This engine initially produced {{convert|287|bhp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|274|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} torque, but in 2005 was increased to {{convert|300|bhp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|260|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. Prices started at $26,000 US, well below the $30,000 mark initially set forth by [[Nissan]]. Coupled to either a 6-speed manual gearbox or 5-speed automatic (the automatic lost {{convert|13|bhp|abbr=on}} in comparison), it was initially available only as a 2-seater hardtop. A convertible model was later introduced in 2004.

The [[Nissan 350Z|350Z]] was available in a selection of seven trim packages, depending on the year: &quot;Base&quot;, &quot;Enthusiast&quot;, &quot;Performance&quot;, &quot;Touring&quot;, &quot;Grand Touring&quot;, &quot;Track&quot; and &quot;[[Nismo]]&quot;.  The base model [[Nissan 350Z|350Z]], in comparison to the more expensive packages, did not have a limited-slip differential or a traction control system. Touring and Grand Touring models both featured leather seats, [[Bose (company)|Bose]] entertainment systems, optional satellite navigation, VDC [[Electronic stability control|(vehicle dynamic control)]], and other user conveniences, while the Grand Touring models also added [[Rays Engineering]] forged wheels and the [[Brembo]] braking system found on the Track and [[Nismo]] models. In 2007, [[Nissan]] dropped the &quot;Track&quot; version in favor of the &quot;[[Nismo]]&quot; edition, but retained the [[Brembo]] brakes, Rays Engineering wheels, and simple interior, but added a larger exhaust and aggressive body kit. The second [[Nismo]] edition, released in 2007, included revised camshafts, a [[Nismo]] sport tuned exhaust, custom Rays Engineering {{convert|18|in|adj=on}} wheels ({{convert|19|in|abbr=on|disp=or}} in rear), front and rear spoilers and rear diffuser, and a Brembo braking system with four-piston front and two-piston rear calipers (with {{convert|12.8|in|abbr=on|disp=or}} front and {{convert|12.7|in|abbr=on|disp=or}} rear rotors).

The 2005 35th Anniversary Edition [[Nissan 350Z|350Z]] and 2006 [[Nissan 350Z|350Z]] equipped with manual transmissions received a newly revised engine, which increased the redline to 7,000 rpm and increased power to {{convert|300|hp|abbr=on}}.

2007-2008 [[Nissan 350Z|350Z]] models came with the 3.5L [[Nissan VQ engine#VQ35HR|VQ35HR]] engine with dual intakes and a 7,500 rpm redline, which produced a power output of {{convert|306|hp|abbr=on}}, and featured a more linear powerband in addition to the increased torque at lower revolutions. It is widely believed that this model year (2007–08) is the most desired among enthusiasts due to the car featuring a revised transmission (CD009) which solved all previous issues and the new engine architecture (VQ35HR) which provided an overall faster car.

===Sixth generation: Nissan 370Z (Z34)===

[[File:2013 Nissan 370Z (Z34 MY13.5) coupe (2015-06-18) 01.jpg|thumb|Nissan 370Z (Z34)]]
On December 30, 2008 the 370Z was introduced as a 2009 model.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nissan News - 370Z&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nissannews.com/newsrelease.do?id=653&amp;mid=182 |title=NISSAN ANNOUNCES PRICING ON ALL-NEW 2009 370Z COUPE |accessdate=2009-07-09 |date=2008-12-30 |publisher=[[Nissan Motor Corporation U.S.A.]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2009 the second generation 2009 Nismo 370Z debuted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nissan News - NISMO 370Z&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nissannews.com/newsrelease.do?id=716&amp;mid=182 |title=All-New 2009 Nissan NISMO 370Z Offers Racing-Inspired Performance and Style |accessdate=2009-07-09 |date=2008-04-07 |publisher=[[Nissan Motor Corporation U.S.A.]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was followed by the introduction of the 2010 370Z Roadster in late summer of 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nissan News - Roadster&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nissannews.com/newsrelease.do?id=697&amp;mid=182 |title=All-New 2010 Nissan 370Z Roadster Adds Open-Air Excitement; Features Power Auto-Lock Top Design |accessdate=2009-07-09 |date=2008-04-07 |publisher=[[Nissan Motor Corporation U.S.A.]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 370Z (Z34) is powered by Nissan's 3.7 liter V6 engine, the [[Nissan VQ engine#VQ37VHR|VQ37VHR]]. The power output ranges from {{convert|333 to 355|PS|kW hp|abbr=on|0}}, with peak torque of {{convert|37 to 38|kgm|Nm lbfft|abbr=on|0}}, depending on market and variant. The 370Z has an official {{convert|0-60|mph|abbr=on}} time of 5.1 seconds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edmunds&quot;&gt;[Edmunds]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the car has also been tested by Motor Trend Magazine, which reported a 4.7 second {{convert|0-60|mph|abbr=on}} with {{convert|1|ft|m|adj=on|1}} of roll out. Quarter mile times range from 13.1 and 13.6 seconds{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}, thus making the 370Z the fastest production Z. The 370Z is available with either a six-speed manual gearbox or a seven-speed automatic with paddle shifters. The six-speed manual is the first production car manual gearbox to feature a system that Nissan refers to as ''SynchroRev Match'', which automatically blips the throttle to match engine and transmission speed during downshifts, thus achieving the same effect as the [[heel-and-toe]] downshift technique.

==Engines==
The first two generations S30 ([[Nissan 240Z|240Z]]/[[Nissan 260Z|260Z]]/[[Nissan 280Z|280Z]]) and S130 ([[Nissan 280ZX|280ZX]]) of Z-car were powered by a [[Straight-6]], (part of the [[Nissan L engine|L-series]] of Nissan engines, which powered most of their vehicles until the early 1980s) with a displacement of 2.4&amp;nbsp;L in the first incarnation, and increasing to 2.6&amp;nbsp;L and 2.8&amp;nbsp;L in the 260Z, and the 280Z and ZX, respectively.

The second generation, the [[Nissan 280ZX|280ZX]], introduced in 1979 was a complete re-design, retaining only the [[Nissan L engine#L28|L28 engine]] and other driveline components.  A [[turbo]] option was introduced in 1981, bringing performance surpassing that of the original 240Z.

The third generation, the [[Nissan 300ZX|300ZX]], switched to a 3.0&amp;nbsp;L [[V6 engine|V6]].  There were 2 generations of the [[Nissan 300ZX|300ZX]], the Z31 from 1984 to 1989, and the Z32 from 1990 to 1996. Both the Z31 and Z32 came in either non-turbo or turbo trims.  During the 90's the cars price continued to elevate and sales continued to fall. Even a major design change in 1998 couldn't save it, and production finally ended in 1999.

While the model names were based on the engine capacity for the US markets, with the 240Z having a 2.4-litre [[Nissan L engine|L24]] engine and the 260Z having a 2.6 litre [[Nissan L engine|L26]] engine and so on to the [[Nissan 300ZX|300ZX]] 3.0 litre V6, due to Japanese taxation laws relating to engine capacity some second and third generation (S130 and Z31) Fairlady Z cars were produced for the Japanese domestic market fitted with 2.0L engines. The S130 was available with an [[Nissan L engine|L20ET]] inline 6, while the Z31 had either a [[Nissan RB engine|RB20DET]] inline 6 or a [[Nissan VG engine|VG20ET]] V6.

In the 2003 model year, Nissan reentered the US sports-car market with the [[Nissan 350Z|350Z]], powered by the 3.5&amp;nbsp;L [[Nissan VQ engine|VQ35DE]] V6 producing {{convert|291|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}}, and styled in an attempt to create a more modern interpretation of the 240Z's lines. It had a new six-speed manual gearbox, and is capable of over {{convert|155|mph|abbr=on}}. The [[350Z]]'s engine was updated twice; in 2005 to the VQ35DE RevUp, producing {{convert|304|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}}, and in 2007 to the VQ35HR, producing {{convert|315|PS|kW hp||abbr=on}}.

The 370Z features a 3.7L [[Nissan VQ engine#VQ37VHR|VQ37VHR]] V6 producing {{convert|333-355|PS|kW hp|abbr=on|0}}.  This engine shares much of its architecture with the VQ35HR, the primary difference being the introduction of Nissan's VVEL (Variable Valve Event and Lift). Due to the similarities between the two engines, many OEM and aftermarket parts are interchangeable.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:BRETeamsm.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The Brock Racing Enterprises (BRE) [[240Z]] driven by [[John Morton]] --&gt;

The first generation Zs ([[Nissan S30|240Z/260Z/280Z]]) proved to be very successful in many forms of racing. The S30s won many SCCA/IMSA championships and even became quite successful in rally and baja races.

[[File:Datsun280ZXrace.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Don Devendorf and [[Tony Adamowicz]] drove a [[Nissan 280ZX|280ZX Turbo]] to the 1983 IMSA GTO Championship.]]The 280ZX proved successful in various classes of racing, particularly in the US. Significant results include:

* 1979 SCCA C Production Category (Bob Sharp Racing 280ZX)
* 1979 and 1980 [[IMSA GT Championship|IMSA GTU Championship]] (Electramotive Datsun 280ZX)
* 1982 and 1983 [[IMSA GT Championship|IMSA GTO Championship]] (Electramotive Datsun 280ZX Turbo)

The 1983 Electramotive [[280ZX|280ZX Turbo]] produced over {{convert|700|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, and reached a terminal speed of {{convert|140|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in the standing quarter mile.

The most notable driver to be associated with the car was actor [[Paul Newman]], who raced with the Bob Sharp Racing team. He also helped to promote the car, even by starring in a series of commercials.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:IMSARacing300ZX.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Paul Newman/Bob Sharp Racing IMSA 300ZX.]] --&gt;
In 1984 to 1985 showroom stock racing, the [[300ZX]] captured wins on numerous occasions. The car scored its only Trans Am win in 1986 at [[Lime Rock Park|Lime Rock]] by [[Paul Newman]] for Bob Sharp Racing.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

From 1985 to 1987, the Electramotive-developed [[Nissan GTP ZX-Turbo|GTP ZX-Turbo]] was raced in the [[IMSA GT Championship]]'s GTP class and also the [[All Japan Sports Prototype Championship]], badged as a Fairlady Z, using a Lola T810 chassis and a [[Nissan VG engine|VG30ET]] engine.  Following development through 1987, the car would become dominant in IMSA GT in 1988.  Additional factory endorsement, combined with a new chassis, transmission and more reliable Goodyear tires contributed to the team's success. The SOHC [[Nissan VG engine|VG30ET]] was making upwards of {{Convert|1000|hp|kW|-2|abbr=on}}, with a [[power band]] that extended from 4000 to 9000 rpm on a single turbo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Electromotive VG30ET power band&quot;&gt;{{cite web

From 1990 to 1995, [[Steve Millen]] drove the twin turbo [[300ZX]] for Clayton Cunningham Racing. The car dominated the IMSA in its GTO, then later GTS categories due to its newly designed chassis and engine. Millen would rank as the #1 Factory Driver for [[Nissan]] for 7 years and earn two IMSA GTS Driving Championships and two IMSA GTS Manufacturer's Championships. Among enthusiasts and the team themselves, the biggest triumph for the race [[Nissan 300ZX|Z32]] was the victory in the [[24 Hours of Daytona]]. In the same year at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], the [[300ZX]] ranked first in the GTS-1 class and 5th overall. In an attempt to level the playing field in the GTS-1 class by reducing the allowable horsepower, the IMSA declared the twin turbo [[Nissan VG engine|VG engine]] ineligible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Konik, Michael: On the Edge&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The JUN-BLITZ Bonneville [[Nissan 300ZX|Z32]] holds the E/BMS class land speed record of 419.84&amp;nbsp;km/h (260.87&amp;nbsp;mph) set at the 1995 Bonneville Speed Trial. The vehicle was built as a partnership between [[JUN Auto]] and BLITZ. This record remains unbroken. In 1990 JUN's first [[Nissan 300ZX|Z32]] went 339.2&amp;nbsp;km/h at their Yatabe test course and hit 373&amp;nbsp;km/h after some tuning at Bonneville.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tanaka&quot;&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Xanavi Nissan 350Z rear.jpg|thumb|right|Xanavi 350Z, rear]]
The 350Z replaced the [[Nissan Skyline GT-R|Skyline GT-R]] and [[Nissan Silvia|Silvia]] as the car for Nissan's factory and customer teams in the [[Super GT|JGTC/Super GT]]'s GT500 class and GT300 class respectively. The GT500 cars used were heavily modified and featured a longer nose and tail (requiring the production of the Type-E homologation special), carbon fiber bodywork, and a tube chassis. In 2004, [[NISMO]] won the GT500 championship. Until the 2007 season, the car was powered by a [[Nissan VQ engine#VQ30DETT|VQ30DETT]] V6.  In order to increase competitiveness, however, a new 4.5L [[V8 engine|V8]] powerplant has been developed.  The 350Z, with slightly more pedestrian modifications also competes in the GT300 class (having started there even before the [[Skyline GT-R]]s were replaced) by teams such as Endless Sports and Mola. In 2003 Hasemi Sports won the GT300 championship with the [[350Z]]. In 2008 season, the [[350Z]]s were all replaced by [[Nissan GT-R]]s in the GT500 class, but they have continued to be used in the GT300 class as the [[Nissan GT-R|GT-R]]s overexceed the horsepower limits which make it impossible to participate. Thus, two [[350Z]]s competed in the series and MOLA won the both Drivers' and Teams' championships in the GT300 class. Two years later, Hasemi Sports won the 2010 GT300 title again before its team's withdrawal of the series in the following season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hasemi-ms.com/index.php|title=Hasemi Motor Sport/ハセミモータースポーツ|author=Hasemi Motor Sport/ハセミモータースポーツ|work=hasemi-ms.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as another 350Z team MOLA also moved up to GT500 class earlier in the preseason time, it marked the first full absence of Nissan vehicles in GT300 class since the establishment of JGTC in 1994.

The [[Nissan 350Z|Z33]] is also popular in import drag racing, one [[Nissan 350Z|Z33]] fielded by Performance Motorsport in the NHRA Sports Compact series, with twin turbo claims to put out over 1,700&amp;nbsp;bhp (1,268&amp;nbsp;kW; 1,724 PS) and achieved 8.33 quarter mile time with its best speed of 176.72&amp;nbsp;mph (284.40&amp;nbsp;km/h).{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Another [[350Z]] built by Injected Performance holds the record as the highest horsepower, street legal [[350Z]] and highest horsepower single turbo [[Nissan VQ engine|VQ35DE]] with a quarter mile time of 8.80 with a speed of 163&amp;nbsp;mph (262&amp;nbsp;km/h). This car was also featured on the March 2008 cover of Turbo Magazine. Lazcano Racing's [[350Z]] is powered by a built Nissan [[Nissan VG engine#VG30DETT|VG30DETT engine]] and has recorded a 1/4 mile time of 6.6 at over 211MPH.

==ZCON==
ZCON is an annual Z-Car convention that is held around the United States of America each year (since 1988).

==Etymology==
{{main article|Etymology of London}}
[[File:London Thames Sunset panorama - Feb 2008.jpg|thumb|300px|The name ''London'' may derive from the [[River Thames]]]]
The [[etymology of London|etymology of ''London'']] is uncertain.&lt;ref name=&quot;mills_139&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Mills|2001|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an ancient name, found in sources from the 2nd century.{{Fix|text=AD?}} It is recorded {{circa}}121 as ''[[Londinium]]'', which points to [[Romano-British]] origin,&lt;ref name=&quot;mills_139&quot;/&gt; and hand-written Roman tablets recovered in the city originating from AD 65/70-80 include the word ''Londinio'' (&quot;in London&quot;).&lt;ref name=NameTablets&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-36415563 |title=UK's oldest hand-written document 'at Roman London dig' |work=BBC News |date=1 June 2016 |accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest attempted explanation, now disregarded, is attributed to [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;mills_139&quot;/&gt; This had it that the name originated from a supposed [[Lud son of Heli|King Lud]], who had allegedly taken over the city and named it ''Kaerlud''.&lt;ref name=london_009&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/02/books/chapters/02-1st-ackro.html?ex=1225339200&amp;en=b9c2c11ad6e1f435&amp;ei=5070&amp;pagewanted=3|title=London|last=Ackroyd|first=Peter|work=The New York Times |accessdate=28 October 2008 | date=2 December 2001|isbn=978-0-7011-7279-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1898, it was commonly accepted that the name was of [[Celts|Celtic]] origin and meant &quot;place belonging to a man called *Londinos&quot;; this explanation has since been rejected.&lt;ref name=&quot;mills_139&quot;/&gt; [[Richard Coates]] proposed in 1998 that it is derived from the pre-Celtic [[Old European hydronymy|Old European]] ''*(p)lowonida'', meaning &quot;river too wide to ford&quot;, and suggested that this was a name given to the part of the [[River Thames]] which flows through London; from this, the settlement gained the Celtic form of its name, ''*Lowonidonjon'';&lt;ref name=coates&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coates |first=Richard |year=1998 |title=A new explanation of the name of London |journal=Transactions of the Philological Society |volume=96 |issue=2 |pages=203–229 |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1467-968X.00027 |doi=10.1111/1467-968X.00027 |ref=harv |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0UqnAy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blackwell-synergy.com%2Fdoi%2Fpdf%2F10.1111%2F1467-968X.00027 |archivedate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; this requires quite a serious amendment however. The ultimate difficulty lies in reconciling the Latin form ''Londinium'' with the modern Welsh ''Llundain'', which should demand{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} a form ''*(h)lōndinion'' (as opposed to *londīnion), from earlier ''*loundiniom''. The possibility cannot be ruled out that the Welsh name was borrowed back in from English at a later date, and thus cannot be used as a basis from which to reconstruct the original name.

Until 1889, the name &quot;London&quot; officially applied only to the [[City of London]], but since then it has also referred to the [[County of London]] and now to [[Greater London]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mills_140&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Mills|2001|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prehistory===
Two recent discoveries indicate probable very early settlements near the Thames in the London area. In 1999, the remains of a [[Bronze Age]] bridge were found on the foreshore north of [[Vauxhall Bridge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Denison&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Denison |first=Simon |title=First 'London Bridge' in River Thames at Vauxhall |journal=British Archaeology |date=July 1999 |issue=46 |url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba46/ba46news.html |accessdate=15 April 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0WdLQ0?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.britarch.ac.uk%2Fba%2Fba46%2Fba46news.html |archivedate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This bridge either crossed the Thames, or gave access to a now lost island in the river. [[Dendrochronology]] dated the timbers to ca. 1500 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Denison&quot;/&gt; In 2010 the foundations of a large timber structure, dated to ca. 4500 BC, were found on the Thames foreshore, south of Vauxhall Bridge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milne&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Milne |first=Gustav |title=London's Oldest Foreshore Structure! |url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/frog-blog/london-s-oldest-find-discovered-at-vauxhall |work=Frog Blog |publisher=Thames Discovery Programme |accessdate=15 April 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0WtZpl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thamesdiscovery.org%2Ffrog-blog%2Flondon-s-oldest-find-discovered-at-vauxhall |archivedate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The function of the mesolithic structure is not known. Both structures are on the south bank, at a natural crossing point where the [[River Effra]] flows into the River Thames.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milne&quot;/&gt;

===Roman London===
[[File:Map of London, 1300.svg|thumb|In 1300, the [[City of London|City]] was still confined within the [[London Wall|Roman walls]]]]
Although there is evidence of scattered [[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] after the invasion of 43&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;roman&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=Roman London |last=Perring |first=Dominic |year=1991 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-203-23133-3|page=1 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This lasted only until around 61, when the [[Iceni]] tribe led by [[Boudica|Queen Boudica]] stormed it, burning it to the ground.&lt;ref name=london_010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/timeline/romanbritain_timeline_noflash.shtml |title=British History Timeline&amp;nbsp;—Roman Britain |publisher=BBC |accessdate=7 June 2008 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0V1GXn?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fhistory%2Fbritish%2Ftimeline%2Fromanbritain_timeline_noflash.shtml |archivedate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next, heavily planned, incarnation of Londinium prospered, and it superseded [[Colchester]] as the capital of the [[Roman Britain|Roman province]] of [[Britannia]] in 100. At its height in the 2nd century, Roman London had a population of around 60,000.

===Anglo-Saxon London (and Viking period)===
With the collapse of Roman rule in the early 5th century, London ceased to be a capital, and the walled city of Londinium was effectively abandoned, although Roman civilisation continued in the [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] area until around 450.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/EventsExhibitions/Past/MissingLink/Themes/TML_themes_Londinium.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108092449/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/EventsExhibitions/Past/MissingLink/Themes/TML_themes_Londinium.htm |archivedate=8 January 2009 |publisher=Museum of London |title=The last days of Londinium |accessdate=31 March 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; From around 500, an [[Anglo-Saxon]] settlement known as [[Anglo-Saxon London|Lundenwic]] developed in the same area, slightly to the west of the old Roman city.&lt;ref name=london_011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/EventsExhibitions/Past/MissingLink/Themes/TML_themes_Lundenwic.htm |title=The early years of Lundenwic |publisher=The [[Museum of London]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610043903/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/EventsExhibitions/Past/MissingLink/Themes/TML_themes_Lundenwic.htm |archivedate=10 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; By about 680, it had revived sufficiently to become a major port, although there is little evidence of large-scale production of goods. From the 820s the town declined because of repeated [[Viking]] invasions. There are three recorded Viking assaults on London; two of these were successful, in 851 and 886, although the Vikings were defeated during another attack in 994.&lt;ref name=&quot;Viking Attacks&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/viking_attacklist.html?showall=1|title=Viking Attacks|accessdate=19 January 2016| deadurl=no |last1=Wheeler |first1=Kip}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Siege of London (MS 1168).jpg|thumb|upright|The [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] siege of London in 1471 is attacked by a [[House of York|Yorkist]] sally]]

The Vikings established [[Danelaw]] over much of the eastern and northern part of England, with its boundary roughly stretching from London to [[Chester]]. It was an area of political and geographical control imposed by the Viking incursions which was formally agreed by the [[Danes|Danish]] [[warlord]], [[Guthrum]] and the [[Kingdom of the West Saxons|West Saxon]] king [[Alfred the Great]] in 886. The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' recorded that Alfred &quot;refounded&quot; London in 886. Archaeological research shows that this involved abandonment of Lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old Roman walls. London then grew slowly until about 950, after which activity increased dramatically.&lt;ref name=&quot;blackwell&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Vince|first= Alan|year=2001|title=London|editors= Lapidge, Michael; Blair, John; Keynes, Simon; Scragg, Donald |encyclopedia=The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England |publisher= Blackwell |isbn=978-0-631-22492-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 11th century, London was beyond all comparison the largest town in England. [[Westminster Abbey]], rebuilt in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style by King [[Edward the Confessor]], was one of the grandest churches in Europe. [[Winchester]] had previously been the capital of Anglo-Saxon England, but from this time on, London became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war. In the view of [[Frank Stenton]]: &quot;It had the resources, and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political self-consciousness appropriate to a national capital.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Frank Stenton|last=Stenton|first= Frank|year=1971|title=Anglo-Saxon England|pages=538–539|publisher= Oxford University Press|edition=3rd|isbn=978-0-19-280139-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Blair |first= John |year=2001|title=Westminster|editors= Lapidge, Michael; Blair, John; Keynes, Simon; Scragg, Donald |encyclopedia=The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England|publisher= Blackwell |isbn=978-0-631-22492-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 12th century, the institutions of central government, which had hitherto accompanied the royal English court as it moved around the country, grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed in one place. For most purposes this was Westminster, although the royal treasury, having been moved from Winchester, came to rest in the Tower. While the [[City of Westminster]] developed into a true capital in governmental terms, its distinct neighbour, the City of London, remained England's largest city and principal commercial centre, and it flourished under its own unique administration, the [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]]. In 1100, its population was around 18,000; by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000.&lt;ref name=london_019&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schofield|first=John|last2=Vince|first2=Alan|author2-link=Alan Vince|title=Medieval Towns: The Archaeology of British Towns in Their European Setting|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8264-6002-8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Qu7QLC7g7VgC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=london+population+1100+-+1300|page=26|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disaster struck in the form of the [[Black Death]] in the mid-14th century, when London lost nearly a third of its population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/black_01.shtml |title=Black Death |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0ZmE6P?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fhistory%2Fbritish%2Fmiddle_ages%2Fblack_01.shtml |archivedate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=no |publisher=BBC History |accessdate=3 November 2008 |ref=harv |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; London was the focus of the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381.&lt;ref name=london_020&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/richard_ii_king.shtml |title=Richard II (1367–1400) |publisher=BBC |accessdate=12 October 2008 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0aYnXz?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fhistory%2Fhistoric_figures%2Frichard_ii_king.shtml |archivedate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commercial route to [[Italy]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] normally lay through [[Antwerp]] and over the [[Alps]]; any ships passing through the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] to or from England were likely to be Italian or [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]]. Upon the re-opening of the [[Netherlands]] to English shipping in January 1565, there ensued a strong outburst of commercial activity.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, George Daniel (1986).

In the 16th century [[William Shakespeare]] and his contemporaries lived in London at a time of hostility to the development of the [[Elizabethan theatre|theatre]]. By the end of the Tudor period in 1603, London was still very compact. There was an assassination attempt on [[James I of England|James I]] in Westminster, in the [[Gunpowder Plot]] on 5 November 1605.&lt;ref name=london_023&gt;{{Cite book |title=James I |last=Durston |first=Christopher|year=1993 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-07779-8 |page=59 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[English Civil War]] the majority of Londoners supported the [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] cause. After an initial advance by the [[Cavaliers|Royalists]] in 1642, culminating in the battles of [[Battle of Brentford (1642)|Brentford]] and [[Battle of Turnham Green|Turnham Green]], London was surrounded by a defensive perimeter wall known as the [[Lines of Communication (London)|Lines of Communication]]. The lines were built by up to 20,000 people, and were completed in under two months.&lt;ref&gt;David Flintham.

In 1762, [[George III of Great Britain|George III]] acquired [[Buckingham Palace|Buckingham House]] and it was enlarged over the next 75 years.

The [[Metropolitan Board of Works]] oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some of the surrounding counties; it was abolished in 1889 when the [[London County Council]] was created out of those areas of the counties surrounding the capital. [[German strategic bombing during World War I|London was bombed by the Germans during the First World War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goebel | first1 = Stefan | last2 = White | first2 = Jerry | year = 2016 | title = London and the First World War | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03058034.2016.1216758 | journal = London Journal | volume = 41 | issue = 3| pages = 1–20 | doi=10.1080/03058034.2016.1216758}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the Second World War, [[the Blitz]] and other bombings by the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' killed over 30,000 Londoners, destroying large tracts of housing and other buildings across the city. Immediately after the war, the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] were held at the original [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], at a time when London had barely recovered from the war.

In 1951, the [[Festival of Britain]] was held on the [[South Bank]]. The [[Great Smog]] of 1952 led to the [[Clean Air Act 1956]], which ended the &quot;[[pea soup fog]]s&quot; for which London had been notorious. From the 1940s onwards, London became home to a large number of [[immigrants]], largely from [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries such as Jamaica, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, making London one of the most diverse cities in Europe.

[[File:London Thames (1930).jpg|thumb|left|A view from Victoria Tower, in late 1920s]]
Primarily starting in the mid-1960s, London became a centre for the worldwide [[youth culture]], exemplified by the [[Swinging London]] subculture associated with the [[King's Road]], [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] and [[Carnaby Street]]. The role of trendsetter was revived during the [[punk rock|punk]] era. In 1965 London's political boundaries were expanded to take into account the growth of the urban area and a new [[Greater London Council]] was created. During [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland, London was subjected to bombing attacks by the [[Provisional IRA]]. Racial inequality was highlighted by the [[1981 Brixton riot]].

Greater London's population declined steadily in the decades after the Second World War, from an estimated peak of 8.6&amp;nbsp;million in 1939 to around 6.8&amp;nbsp;million in the 1980s. The principal ports for London moved downstream to [[Port of Felixstowe|Felixstowe]] and [[Port of Tilbury|Tilbury]], with the [[London Docklands]] area becoming a focus for regeneration, including the [[Canary Wharf]] development. This was borne out of London's ever-increasing role as a major international financial centre during the 1980s. The [[Thames Barrier]] was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the [[North Sea]].

The Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, which left London as the only large metropolis in the world without a central administration. In 2000, London-wide government was restored, with the creation of the [[Greater London Authority]]. To celebrate the start of the 21st century, the [[Millennium Dome]], [[London Eye]] and [[Millennium Bridge (London)|Millennium Bridge]] were constructed. On 6 July 2005 London was awarded the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], making London the first city to stage the [[Olympic Games]] three times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/front_page/4655555.stm |title= London beats Paris to 2012 Games |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 July 2005 |accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 July 2005, three [[London Underground]] trains and a [[double-decker bus]] were bombed in a [[7 July 2005 London bombings|series of terrorist attacks]].&lt;ref name=london_031&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/uk/05/london_blasts/what_happened/html/default.stm |title=7&amp;nbsp;July Bombings: Overview |publisher=BBC News |location=London |accessdate=28 April 2008 |ref=harv |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5MchR94le?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.bbc.co.uk%2F1%2Fshared%2Fspl%2Fhi%2Fuk%2F05%2Flondon_blasts%2Fwhat_happened%2Fhtml%2Fdefault.stm |archivedate=13 February 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, London named alongside [[New York City]] and [[Hong Kong]] as [[Nylonkong]], being hailed as the world's three most influential [[global cities]]. In January 2015, Greater London's population was estimated to be 8.63 million, the highest level since 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;gla-pop-2015&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Population Growth in London, 1939–2015|url=http://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/population-change-1939-2015/resource/0a026346-960e-49e6-b968-a386d2cfe55f|archive-url=https://londondatastore-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/dataset/population-change-1939-2015/historical%20population%201939-2015.pdf|archive-date=Feb 2015|dead-url=no|website=London Datastore|publisher=Greater London Authority|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|Brexit referendum]] in 2016, the UK as a whole decided to leave the European Union, but a majority of London constituencies voted to remain in the EU. This led to over a hundred thousand Londoners petitioning Mayor [[Sadiq Khan]] to declare London's independence from the UK and rejoin the EU. Supporters cite London's status as a &quot;[[world city]]&quot; and its demographic and economic differences from the rest of the United Kingdom, and argue that it should become a city-state based on the model of [[Singapore]], while remaining an EU member state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/wouldnt-you-prefer-to-be-president-sadiq-thousands-back-campaign-for-sadiq-khan-to-declare-londons-a3280141.html|title=Thousands call on Sadiq Khan to declare London's independence|date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Thames Valley]] is a [[floodplain]] surrounded by gently rolling hills including [[Parliament Hill, London|Parliament Hill]], [[Addington Hills]], and [[Primrose Hill]]. The Thames was once a much broader, shallower river with extensive [[marsh]]lands; at high tide, its shores reached five times their present width.&lt;ref name=london_065&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=M9qvtYYhRtAC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=thames+%22iron+age%22+london+wide+geography+shallow+marsh |title=London: A History |first=Francis|last= Sheppard | page=10 |publisher= Oxford University Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-19-285369-1 |accessdate=6 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Victorian era]] the Thames has been extensively [[Thames Embankment|embanked]], and many of its London [[Tributaries of the River Thames|tributaries]] now flow [[Subterranean rivers of London|underground]].

Despite its reputation as being a rainy city, London receives less precipitation ({{convert|601|mm|0|abbr=on|disp=comma}}, in a year) than [[Rome]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Toulouse]], [[Naples]], [[Sydney]] and [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_066062_All.shtml|title=Climate statistics for Australian locations|work=bom.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldweather.org/176/c00604.htm |title=Weather Information for Naples |publisher=Worldweather.org |date=5 October 2006 |accessdate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theweathernetwork.com/ The Weather Network] 18 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://france.meteofrance.com/france/climat_france?CLIMAT_PORTLET.path=climatstationn%2F31069001 Prévisions météo de Météo-France – Climat en France]{{Dead link|date=October 2016}} 18 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldweather.org/062/c01058.htm World Weather Information Service – Toulouse] 18 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usclimatedata.com/climate/new-york/new-york/united-states/usny0996|title=Climate New York – New York and Weather averages New York|first=US Climate|last=Data}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temperature extremes for all sites in the London area range from {{convert|38.1|°C|°F|1}} at Kew during August 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1256/wea.10.04B/pdf|title=August 2003 weather|accessdate=18 September 2012 | doi=10.1256/wea.10.04B|volume=59|journal=Weather|pages=239–246}}&lt;/ref&gt; down to {{convert|-16.1|°C|°F|1}} at Northolt during January 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personal.dundee.ac.uk/~taharley/british_weather_in_january.htm |title=January 1962 weather |accessdate=18 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903235843/https://www.personal.dundee.ac.uk/~taharley/british_weather_in_january.htm |archivedate=3 September 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Summers are generally warm and sometimes hot. London's average July high is {{convert|24|°C|°F|1}}. On average London will see 31 days above {{convert|25|°C|°F|1}} each year, and 4.2 days above {{convert|30.0|°C|°F|1}} every year. During the [[2003 European heat wave]] there were 14 consecutive days above {{convert|30|°C|°F|1}} and 2 consecutive days where temperatures reached {{convert|38|°C|°F|1}}, leading to hundreds of heat related deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The impact of the 2003 heat wave on daily mortality in England and Wales and the use of rapid weekly mortality estimates|journal=Eurosurveillance|volume=10|issue=7|date=1 July 2005|first1=H|last1=Johnson|first2=RS|last2=Kovats|first3=G|last3=McGregor|first4=J|last4=Stedman|first5=M|last5=Gibbs|first6=H|last6=Walton6|url=http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winters are generally cool and damp with little temperature variation. Snowfall occurs occasionally and can cause travel disruption when this happens. Snowfall is more common in outer London. Spring and autumn are mixed seasons and can be pleasant. As a large city, London has a considerable [[urban heat island]] effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.london.gov.uk/mayor/environment/climate-change/docs/UHI_summary_report.pdf|title=London's Urban Heat Island: A Summary for Decision Makers|publisher=Greater London Authority|date=October 2006|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the centre of London at times {{convert|5|C-change|0|}} warmer than the suburbs and outskirts.

===Districts===
{{Main article|List of districts of London|London boroughs}}

London's vast urban area is often described using a set of district names, such as [[Bloomsbury]], [[Mayfair]], [[Wembley]] and [[Whitechapel]]. These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or [[Metropolitan boroughs of the County of London|former boroughs]].

Such names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without official boundaries. Since 1965 Greater London has been divided into 32 [[London borough]]s in addition to the ancient City of London.&lt;ref name=london_071&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/london-life/city-government/boroughs.jsp |title=London boroughs&amp;nbsp;— London Life, GLA |publisher=London Government |accessdate=3 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213025156/http://www.london.gov.uk/london-life/city-government/boroughs.jsp |archivedate=13 December 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=london_072&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Dogan |first1=Mattei |first2=John D. |last2=Kasarda |title=The Metropolis Era |publisher=Sage |year=1988 |page=99 |isbn=978-0-8039-2603-5 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=_GFPAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=1965,+32+boroughs+of+london&amp;dq=1965,+32+boroughs+of+london |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City of London is the main financial district,&lt;ref name=london_073&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/london-life/business-and-jobs/financial-centre.jsp |title=London as a financial centre |publisher=Mayor of London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106051217/http://www.london.gov.uk/london-life/business-and-jobs/financial-centre.jsp |archivedate=6 January 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Canary Wharf]] has recently developed into a new financial and commercial hub in the [[London Docklands|Docklands]] to the east.

The [[East End of London|East End]] is the area closest to the original [[Port of London]], known for its high immigrant population, as well as for being one of the poorest areas in London.&lt;ref name=&quot;East End&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/8487518/site/newsweek/ |date=6 July 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829024354/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/8487518/site/newsweek/ |archivedate=29 August 2006 |title=Tomorrow's East End |newspaper=Newsweek |author=Flynn, Emily |location=New York |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The surrounding [[North East (London sub region)|East London]] area saw much of London's early industrial development; now, [[brownfield land|brownfield]] sites throughout the area are being redeveloped as part of the [[Thames Gateway]] including the [[London Riverside]] and [[Lower Lea Valley]], which was developed into the [[Olympic Park, London|Olympic Park]] for the [[London 2012 Olympic bid|2012 Olympics and Paralympics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;East End&quot;/&gt;

===Architecture===
{{Main article|Architecture of London|List of tallest buildings and structures in London}}
[[File:Tower of london from swissre.jpg|thumb|The Tower, with Tower Bridge built 800 years later on the River Thames]]
London's buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular [[architectural]] style, partly because of their varying ages. Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the [[National Gallery]], are constructed from [[Portland stone]]. Some areas of the city, particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white [[stucco]] or whitewashed buildings. Few structures in central London pre-date the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] of 1666, these being a few trace [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] remains, the [[Tower of London]] and a few scattered [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] survivors in the City. Further out is, for example, the [[Tudor period|Tudor-period]] [[Hampton Court Palace]], England's oldest surviving Tudor palace, built by Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]] {{circa}}1515.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/tudors/hampton_court_01.shtml |title=Hampton Court: The Lost Palace |publisher=BBC History |date=29 March 2011 |author=Foyle, Jonathan |accessdate=16 June 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0pDL3i?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fhistory%2Fbritish%2Ftudors%2Fhampton_court_01.shtml |archivedate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Wren|Wren]]'s late 17th-century churches and the financial institutions of the 18th and 19th centuries such as the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] and the [[Bank of England]], to the early 20th century [[Old Bailey]] and the 1960s [[Barbican Estate]] form part of the varied architectural heritage.

The disused - but soon to be rejuvenated - 1939 [[Battersea Power Station]] by the river in the south-west is a local landmark, while some railway termini are excellent examples of [[Victorian architecture]], most notably [[St Pancras railway station|St. Pancras]] and [[Paddington railway station|Paddington]].&lt;ref name=london_078&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Paddington_Station.html |title=Paddington Station |publisher=Great Buildings |accessdate=6 June 2008 |ref=harv |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0pwi86?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.greatbuildings.com%2Fbuildings%2FPaddington_Station.html |archivedate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The density of London varies, with high employment density in the [[Central London|central area]], high residential densities in [[inner London]], and lower densities in [[Outer London]].

[[The Monument]] in the City of London provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the [[Great Fire of London]], which originated nearby. [[Marble Arch]] and [[Wellington Arch]], at the north and south ends of [[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]], respectively, have royal connections, as do the [[Albert Memorial]] and [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[Kensington]]. [[Nelson's Column]] is a nationally recognised monument in [[Trafalgar Square]], one of the focal points of central London. Older buildings are mainly brick built, most commonly the yellow [[London stock brick]] or a warm orange-red variety, often decorated with carvings and white plaster [[moulding (decorative)|mouldings]].&lt;ref name=london_077&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=A1&amp;xml=/property/2008/03/27/lpgreen127.xml |title=Eco homes: Wooden it be lovely... ? |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=12 October 2008 |location=London |first=Sarah |last=Lonsdale |date=27 March 2008 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0rvzUL?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/main.jhtml?view%3DDETAILS%26grid%3DA1%26xml%3D/property/2008/03/27/lpgreen127.xml |archivedate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- [[File:Buckingham Palace from gardens, London, UK - Diliff.jpg|left|thumb|[[Buckingham Palace]] is the official residence of the British monarch]] --&gt;
In the dense areas, most of the concentration is via medium- and high-rise buildings. London's [[skyscraper]]s, such as [[30 St Mary Axe]], [[Tower 42]], the [[Broadgate Tower]] and [[One Canada Square]], are mostly in the two financial districts, the [[City of London]] and [[Canary Wharf]]. High-rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct protected views of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and other historic buildings. Nevertheless, there are a number of very tall skyscrapers in central London (see [[Tall buildings in London]]), including the 95-storey [[Shard London Bridge]], the [[List of tallest buildings in the European Union|tallest building in the European Union]].

Other notable modern buildings include [[City Hall (London)|City Hall]] in [[Southwark]] with its distinctive oval shape&lt;ref name=london_079&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2129199.stm |title=Inside London's new 'glass egg' |date=16 July 2002 |work=BBC News |accessdate=26 April 2008 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0sZ57q?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.bbc.co.uk%2F1%2Fhi%2Fuk%2F2129199.stm |archivedate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[British Library]] in [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]]/[[Kings Cross, London|Kings Cross]]. What was formerly the [[Millennium Dome]], by the Thames to the east of Canary Wharf, is now an entertainment venue called the [[The O2 (London)|O2 Arena]].

===Natural history===
The London Natural History Society suggest that London is &quot;one of the World's Greenest Cities&quot; with more than 40 percent green space or open water. They indicate that 2000 species of flowering plant have been found growing there and that the [[Tideway|tidal Thames]] supports 120 species of fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lnhs.org.uk/index.htm|title=Wildlife in London, England: LNHS Home page|work=lnhs.org.uk}}{{Dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also state that over 60 species of bird nest in [[central London]] and that their members have recorded 47 species of butterfly, 1173 moths and more than 270 kinds of spider around London. London's [[wetland]] areas support nationally important populations of many water birds. London has 38 [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSIs), two [[National Nature Reserves]] and 76 [[Local Nature Reserves]].&lt;ref&gt;London Natural History Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amphibians]] are common in the capital, including [[smooth newt]]s living by the [[Tate Modern]], and common [[frog]]s, common [[toad]]s, [[palmate newt]]s and [[great crested newt]]s. On the other hand, native reptiles such as [[slow-worm]]s, [[common lizard]]s, [[grass snake]]s and [[Vipera berus|adders]], are mostly only seen in [[Outer London]].&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Tuffrey (27 July 2012).

[[File:Flickr - Duncan~ - Fox Trot.jpg|thumb|left|Fox on Ayres Street, [[Southwark]], [[South London]] ]]

Among other inhabitants of London are 10,000 foxes, so that there are now 16 foxes for every square mile (2.6 square kilometres) of London. These urban foxes are noticeably bolder than their country cousins, sharing the pavement with pedestrians and raising cubs in people's backyards. Foxes have even sneaked into the [[Houses of Parliament]], where one was found asleep on a filing cabinet. Another broke into the grounds of [[Buckingham Palace]], reportedly killing some of Queen Elizabeth{{nbsp}}II's prized [[pink flamingo]]s. Generally, however, foxes and city folk appear to get along. A survey in 2001 by the London-based [[Mammal Society]] found that 80 percent of 3,779 respondents who volunteered to keep a diary of garden mammal visits liked having them around. This sample cannot be taken to represent Londoners as a whole.&lt;ref name=mammalreport&gt;{{cite web|title=The Garden Mammal Survey Report 2001|url=http://www.mammal.org.uk/sites/default/files/Summary%20Report%20to%20participants%20August%202001.PDF|website=The Mammal Society|publisher=The Mammal Society|accessdate=23 November 2015}}{{Dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/05/foxes-london_2.html &quot;10,000 Foxes Roam London&quot;.

===Accent===
There are many accents that are traditionally thought of as London accents. The most well known of the London accents long ago acquired the [[Cockney]] label, which is heard both in London itself, and across the wider [[South East England]] region more generally.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Cracking Up!&quot;. p. 178. Lulu.com&lt;/ref&gt; The accent of a 21st-century Londoner varies widely; what is becoming more and more common amongst the under-30s however is some fusion of Cockney with a whole array of ethnic accents, in particular [[Caribbean]], which form an accent labelled [[Multicultural London English]] (MLE).&lt;ref name=&quot;MCLE&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/jafaican-and-tikkiny-drown-out-the-east-ends-cockney-twang-473688.html |title=Jafaican and Tikkiny drown out the East End's Cockney twang |first=Jonathan |last=Brown |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=11 April 2006 |accessdate=22 August 2008 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yoK682mq?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fuk%2Fthis-britain%2Fjafaican-and-tikkiny-drown-out-the-east-ends-cockney-twang-473688.html |archivedate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other widely heard and spoken accent is RP ([[Received Pronunciation]]) in various forms, which can often be heard in the media and many of other traditional professions and beyond, although this accent is not limited to London and South East England, and can also be heard selectively throughout the whole UK amongst certain social groupings.

London finance industry is based in the [[City of London]] and [[Canary Wharf]], the two major [[Central business district|Central Business Districts]] in London.

For many bankers established in Amsterdam (e.g. Hope, Baring), this was only time to move to London. The London financial elite was strengthened by a strong Jewish community from all over Europe capable of mastering the most sophisticated financial tools of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=Yor4DAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Olivier+Coispeau%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjY97am4trPAhXhAsAKHfAsCUAQ6AEIODAF#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Finance Masters: A Brief History of International Financial Centers in the Last Millennium|last=Coispeau|first=Olivier|date=10 August 2016|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=9789813108844|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This unique concentration of talents accelerated the transition from the Commercial Revolution to the Industrial Revolution. By the end of the 19th century, Britain was the wealthiest of all nations, and London a leading [[financial centre]]. Still, as of 2016 London tops the world rankings on both the Global Financial Centers Index (GFCI) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.longfinance.net/images/gfci/20/GFCI20_26Sep2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and The Global Cities Index.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.atkearney.com/documents/10192/8178456/Global+Cities+2016.pdf/8139cd44-c760-4a93-ad7d-11c5d347451a&lt;/ref&gt;

London's largest industry is finance, and its [[financial export]]s make it a large contributor to the UK's [[balance of payments]]. Around 325,000 people were employed in financial services in London until mid-2007. London has over 480 overseas banks, more than any other city in the world. It is also the world's biggest currency trading centre, accounting for some 37 percent of the $5.1 trillion average daily volume, according to the BIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-global-markets-bis-britain-idUKKCN11O0C4|title=London's core role in euros under spotlight after Brexit vote|first=Reuters|last=Editorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 85 percent (3.2&amp;nbsp;million) of the employed population of greater London works in the services industries. Because of its prominent global role, London's economy had been affected by the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]]. However, by 2010 the City has recovered; put in place new regulatory powers, proceeded to regain lost ground and re-established London's economic dominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/business/global/21rglofinuk.html|title=The London Banking Center Is Beginning to Feel Like Itself Again.|date=21 January 2010|work=International Herald Tribune|via=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with [[professional services]] headquarters, the [[City of London]] is home to the [[Bank of England]], [[London Stock Exchange]], and [[Lloyd's of London]] insurance market.

Over half of the UK's top 100 listed companies (the [[FTSE 100]]) and over 100 of Europe's 500 largest companies have their headquarters in central London. Over 70 per cent of the FTSE 100 are within London's metropolitan area, and 75 per cent of [[Fortune 500]] companies have offices in London.&lt;ref name=&quot;london_113&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonstockexchange.com/en-gb/ |title=London Stock Exchange |year=2008 |publisher=London Stock Exchange plc. |accessdate=27 April 2008 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yo1FWjWx?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.londonstockexchange.com%2Fen-gb%2F |archivedate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 he assumed responsibility for some local lines, which now form the [[London Overground]] network, adding to the existing responsibility for the London Underground, trams and buses. The public transport network is administered by [[Transport for London]] (TfL).

The lines that formed the London Underground, as well as trams and buses, became part of an integrated transport system in 1933 when the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] or ''[[London Transport (brand)|London Transport]]'' was created. Transport for London is now the statutory corporation responsible for most aspects of the transport system in Greater London, and is run by a board and a commissioner appointed by the [[Mayor of London]].&lt;ref name=stat_tfl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/help/faq.jsp#transport |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019055413/http://www.london.gov.uk/help/faq.jsp |archivedate=19 October 2007 |title=How do I find out about transport in London? |publisher=Greater London Authority |accessdate=5 June 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suburban====
[[File:King's Cross Western Concourse.jpg|thumb|[[King's Cross railway station]] Western Concourse]]
There are 366 [[railway stations]] in the [[London fare zones|London Travelcard Zones]] on an extensive above-ground suburban railway network. South London, particularly, has a high concentration of railways as it has fewer Underground lines. Most rail lines terminate around the centre of London, running into [[London station group|eighteen terminal stations]], with the exception of the [[Thameslink]] trains connecting [[Bedford]] in the north and [[Brighton]] in the south via [[London Luton Airport|Luton]] and [[Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] airports.&lt;ref name=&quot;london_127&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstcapitalconnect.co.uk/Main.php?sEvent=HomePage |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5nDd2BCwh?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.firstcapitalconnect.co.uk%2FMain.php%3FsEvent%3DHomePage |archivedate=1 February 2010 |title=First Capital Connect |publisher=First Capital Connect |accessdate=27 April 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; London has Britain's busiest station&amp;nbsp;by number of passengers – [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo]], with over 184&amp;nbsp;million people using the interchange station complex (which includes [[London Waterloo East railway station|Waterloo East]] station) each year.&lt;ref name=&quot;National Rail Station Usage&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/server/show/nav.1529 |title=Rail Station Usage |publisher=Office of Rail Regulation |accessdate=24 October 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5QO6kHRpk?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rail-reg.gov.uk%2Fserver%2Fshow%2Fnav.1529 |archivedate=16 July 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tube exits&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/corporate/modesoftransport/tube/performance/default.asp?onload=entryexit |title=Tube exits |publisher=Transport for London |accessdate=24 October 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5QW719FI3?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tfl.gov.uk%2Ftfl%2Fcorporate%2Fmodesoftransport%2Ftube%2Fperformance%2Fdefault.asp%3Fonload%3Dentryexit |archivedate=22 July 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rws|Clapham Junction}} is the busiest station in Europe by the number of trains passing.

====Inter-city and international====
[[File:St Pancras railway station MMB I8.jpg|thumb|[[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras International]] is the main terminal for high speed [[Eurostar]] and [[HS1]] services, as well as commuter suburban [[Thameslink]] and inter-city [[East Midlands Trains]] services]]

London is the centre of the [[National Rail]] network, with 70 percent of rail journeys starting or ending in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rail|url=http://londonfirst.co.uk/our-focus/londons-transport-infrastructure/rail/|work=London First|publisher=London First|accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like suburban rail services, regional and inter-city trains depart from several termini around the city centre, linking London with the rest of Britain including [[Birmingham]], [[Brighton]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Bristol]], [[Cardiff]], [[Derby]], [[Exeter]], [[Sheffield]], [[Southampton]], [[Leeds]], [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], [[Cambridge]], [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]], [[Edinburgh]] and [[Glasgow]].

Some international railway services to [[Continental Europe]] were operated during the 20th century as [[boat train]]s, such as the ''[[Admiraal de Ruijter (train)|Admiraal de Ruijter]]'' to [[Amsterdam]] and the ''[[Night Ferry]]'' to Paris and Brussels. The opening of the [[Channel Tunnel]] in 1994 connected London directly to the continental rail network, allowing [[Eurostar]] services to begin. Since 2007, high-speed trains link [[St Pancras railway station|St. Pancras International]] with [[Lille]], [[Paris]], [[Brussels]] and European tourist destinations via the [[High Speed 1]] rail link and the [[Channel Tunnel]].&lt;ref name=london_128&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurostar.com/dynamic/index.jsp;ERSPRDSession=LJqZB7nyKlW9lVLvZzK534LvMjL519fPDS4R0QGn51CprylVmjH8!685848002 |title=Eurostar |publisher=Eurostar |accessdate=6 June 2008 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yoJz4xiY?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurostar.com%2Fdynamic%2Findex.jsp%3BERSPRDSession%3DLJqZB7nyKlW9lVLvZzK534LvMjL519fPDS4R0QGn51CprylVmjH8%21685848002 |archivedate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Southeastern (train operating company)|high-speed domestic]] trains started in June 2009 linking [[Kent]] to London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southeastern Highspeed&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southeasternrailway.co.uk/highspeed/ |title=Highspeed |publisher=Southeastern |accessdate=5 February 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yoJzQVXK?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.southeasternrailway.co.uk%2Fhighspeed%2F |archivedate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are plans for a [[High Speed 2|second high speed line]] linking London to the Midlands, North West England, and Yorkshire.

====Freight====
Although [[rail freight]] levels are far down compared to their height, significant quantities of cargo are also carried into and out of London by rail; chiefly building materials and [[landfill]] waste.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freight Plan&quot;&gt;August 2007, [https://www.tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/rail-freight-strategy-aug-2007.pdf Rail Freight Strategy]{{dead link|date=December 2016}}, [[London Rail]]&lt;/ref&gt; As a major hub of the British railway network, London's tracks also carry large amounts of freight for the other regions, such as [[containerisation|container freight]] from the Channel Tunnel and [[English Channel]] ports, and [[nuclear waste]] for [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] at [[Sellafield]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Freight Plan&quot;/&gt;

===Buses and trams===
[[File:Arriva London bus DW262 (LJ59 GUA), 18 September 2010.jpg|thumb|The [[London buses|red double decker bus]] is an iconic symbol of London]]
London's [[London Buses|bus network]] is one of the largest in the world, running 24 hours a day, with about 8,500 buses, more than 700 bus routes and around 19,500 bus stops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buses&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=What we do – Buses|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/what-we-do/buses|work=Transport for London|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the network had more than 2 billion commuter trips per annum, more than the Underground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buses&quot;/&gt; Around £850&amp;nbsp;million is taken in revenue each year.

London has a modern tram network, known as [[Tramlink]], centred on [[Croydon]] in [[South London]]. The network has 39 stops and four routes, and carried 28&amp;nbsp;million people in 2013.&lt;ref name=Trams&gt;{{cite web|title=What we do – Trams|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/what-we-do/tramlink|work=Transport for London|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=5 April 2014}}{{Dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since June 2008 [[Transport for London]] has completely owned Tramlink, and it plans to spend £54m by 2015 on maintenance, renewals, upgrades and capacity enhancements.&lt;ref name=london_134&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/tramlink-factsheet.pdf |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5o8t78IGj?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tfl.gov.uk%2Fassets%2Fdownloads%2Ftramlink-factsheet.pdf |archivedate=11 March 2010 |date=Summer 2009 |publisher=Transport for London |title=Tramlink Factsheet |accessdate=19 February 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cable car===
London's first and only cable car, known as the [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|Emirates Air Line]], opened in June 2012. Crossing the [[River Thames]], linking [[Greenwich Peninsula]] and the [[Royal Docks]] in the east of the city, the cable car is integrated with London's Oyster Card ticketing system, although special fares are charged. Costing £60 million to build, it carries over 3,500 passengers every day, although this is very much lower than its capacity. Similar to the [[Santander Cycles]] bike hire scheme, the cable car is sponsored in a 10-year deal by the airline [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]].

===Cycling===
[[File:Belgrave Road, Victoria, London - Boris Bikes - Santander Cycles by Elliott Brown.jpg|thumb|Santander Cycle Hire near Victoria in Central London]]
[[Cycling in London|Cycling]] is an increasingly popular way to get around London. The launch of [[Santander Cycles|a cycle hire scheme]] in July 2010 has been successful and generally well received. The [[London Cycling Campaign]] lobbies for better provision.&lt;ref name=&quot;london_122&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcc.org.uk/ |title=London Cycling Campaign |date=20 November 2006 |publisher=Rosanna Downes |accessdate=27 April 2008 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yo1Hlskj?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lcc.org.uk%2F |archivedate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Port and river boats===
From being the largest port in the world, the [[Port of London]] is now only the second-largest in the United Kingdom, handling 45 million tonnes of cargo each year.&lt;ref name=handling&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/maritime/ports/provportstats2009 |title=ARCHIVED CONTENT&amp;#93; Provisional Port Statistics 2009 |publisher=Department for Transport&amp;nbsp;– Webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk |accessdate=26 April 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yoJx5cho?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwebarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk%2F%2B%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.dft.gov.uk%2Fpgr%2Fstatistics%2Fdatatablespublications%2Fmaritime%2Fports%2Fprovportstats2009 |archivedate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of this actually passes through the [[Port of Tilbury]], outside the boundary of Greater London.

London has frequent river boat services on the Thames known as [[Thames Clippers]]. These run up to every 20 minutes between [[Embankment Pier]] and [[North Greenwich Pier]]. The [[Woolwich Ferry]], with 2.5 million passengers every year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/27762.aspx Transport for London: Woolwich Ferry, 50 years on] Retrieved 8 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; is a frequent service linking the [[North Circular Road|North]] and [[South Circular Road, London|South Circular]] Roads. Other operators run both commuter and tourist boat services in London.

===Roads===
[[File:Rush hour on the A102 - geograph.org.uk - 205323.jpg|thumb|right|The [[A102 road|A102]], near [[Greenwich]]. This was one of the few routes proposed in the [[London Ringways|Ringways Plan]] within [[Inner London]] to be built.]]
Although the majority of journeys involving central London are made by public transport, car travel is common in the suburbs. The [[London Inner Ring Road|inner ring road]] (around the city centre), the [[A406 road|North]] and [[A205 road|South Circular]] roads (in the suburbs), and the outer orbital [[motorway]] (the [[M25 motorway|M25]], outside the built-up area) encircle the city and are intersected by a number of busy radial routes—but very few motorways penetrate into [[inner London]]. A plan for a comprehensive network of motorways throughout the city (the [[London Ringways|Ringways Plan]]) was prepared in the 1960s but was mostly cancelled in the early 1970s. The M25 is the longest ring-road motorway in the world at {{convert|121.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Ken (2000). &quot;Guinness World Records 2001&quot;. p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=london_143&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/threecounties/travel/m25/m25_facts.shtml |title=Beds, Herts and Bucks Travel&amp;nbsp;— All you need to know about the M25 |publisher=BBC |date=17 August 1988 |accessdate=20 February 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yoK0nLrV?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fthreecounties%2Ftravel%2Fm25%2Fm25_facts.shtml |archivedate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] and [[M1 motorway|M1]] connect London to [[Leeds]], and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Edinburgh]].

London is notorious for its traffic congestion, with the M25 motorway the busiest stretch in the country.
