Moscow is situated on the [[Moskva River]] in the [[Central Federal District]] of [[European Russia]]. In the course of its history the city has served as the capital of a progression of states, from the [[medieval]] [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and the subsequent [[Tsardom of Russia]] to the [[Soviet Union]]. Moscow is the site of the [[Moscow Kremlin]], a medieval city-fortress that is today the residence of the Russian president. The Moscow Kremlin is also one of several [[World Heritage Site]]s in the city. Both chambers of the Russian parliament (the [[State Duma]] and the [[Federation Council of Russia|Federation Council]]) also sit in Moscow.

The city is served by an extensive transit network, which includes four international airports, nine railway terminals, and one of the deepest underground metro systems in the world, the [[Moscow Metro]], third to [[Tokyo subway|Tokyo]] and [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway|Seoul]] in terms of passenger numbers. It is recognized as one of the city's landmarks due to the rich and varied architecture of its 188 stations.

Over time, Moscow has acquired a number of [[epithet]]s, most referring to its size and preeminent status within the nation: The [[Third Rome]] ({{lang|ru|Третий Рим}}), The Whitestone One ({{lang|ru|Белокаменная}}), The First Throne ({{lang|ru|Первопрестольная}}), and The Forty Forties ({{lang|ru|Сорок Сороков}}). In old Russian the word &quot;{{lang|ru|Сорок}}&quot; (''forty'') also meant a church administrative district, which consisted of about forty churches. The  [[demonym]] for a Moscow resident is &quot;{{lang|ru|москвич}}&quot; (''moskvich''), rendered in English as ''Muscovite''.

== History ==
{{main|History of Moscow}}

The city is named after the river (old {{lang-ru|гра́д Моско́в}}, literally &quot;the city by the Moskva River&quot;). The first reference to Moscow dates from 1147 when [[Yuri Dolgorukiy]] called upon the prince of the [[Novhorod-Siverskyi|Novgorod-Severski]] to &quot;come to me, brother, to Moscow&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;dolgorukiy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.oxy.edu/richmond/csp8/history_of_moscow.htm |title=The History of Moscow |publisher=Occidental College |last=Comins-Richmond |first=Walter |accessdate=2006-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine years later, in 1156, Prince Yuri Dolgorukiy of [[Rostov]] ordered the construction of a wooden wall, the Kremlin, which had to be rebuilt multiple times, to surround the emerging city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://russia.nypl.org/events/Kremlin.html |title=Russia Engages the World: The Building of the Kremlin, 1156–1516 |publisher=The New York Public Library |accessdate=2006-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the sacking of 1237–1238, when the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] burned the city to the ground and killed its inhabitants, Moscow recovered and became the capital of the independent [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] [[principality]] in 1327.&lt;ref name=&quot;golden-ring&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moscow-city.ru/download/source/Golden_Ring_Engl.pdf/8-11.pdf|format=PDF|title=Along the Moscow Golden Ring |publisher=Moscow, Russia Tourist Information center|accessdate=2006-07-05}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its favorable position on the headwaters of the [[Volga River]] contributed to steady expansion. Moscow developed into a stable and prosperous principality, known as Grand Duchy of Moscow, for many years and attracted a large number of refugees from across Russia.

Under [[Ivan I of Moscow]] the city replaced [[Tver]] as a political center of Vladimir-Suzdal and became the sole collector of taxes for the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol-Tatar rulers]]. By paying high tribute, Ivan won an important concession from the [[Khan (title)|Khan]]. Unlike other principalities, Moscow was not divided among his sons, but was passed intact to his eldest. Moscow's opposition against foreign domination grew. In 1380, prince [[Dmitry Donskoy]] of Moscow led a united Russian army to an important victory over the [[Golden Horde|Tatars]] in the [[Battle of Kulikovo]]. The battle, however, was not decisive and only two years later Moscow was sacked by khan [[Tokhtamysh]]. [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]], in 1480, [[Great stand on the Ugra river|finally broke the Russian people free]] from Tatar control, allowing Moscow to become the center of power in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iusb.edu/~journal/2002/vogel_2/vogel.html|title=The Mongol Connection: Mongol Influences on the Development of Moscow |last=Vogel|first=Michael|publisher=Indiana University South Bend|accessdate=2006-07-03 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060107213535/http://www.iusb.edu/~journal/2002/vogel_2/vogel.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate= 2006-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Ivan III the city became the capital of an empire that would eventually encompass all of present-day Russia and other lands.

In 1571, the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean Tatars]] attacked and [[Russo-Crimean Wars|sacked Moscow]], burning everything but the Kremlin.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=i85noYD9C0EC&amp;pg=PA260&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Unending Frontier: An Environmental History of the Early Modern World]''&quot;.

In 1609, the [[Sweden|Swedish]] army led by Count [[Jacob De la Gardie]] and [[Evert Horn]] started their march from [[Great Novgorod]] toward Moscow to help [[Tsar]] [[Vasili IV of Russia|Vasili Shuiski]], entered Moscow in 1610 and suppressed the rebellion against the Tsar, but left it early in 1611, following which the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish–Lithuanian]] army invaded. During the [[Polish–Muscovite War (1605–1618)]] [[hetman]] [[Stanisław Żółkiewski]] entered Moscow after defeating the Russians in the [[Battle of Klushino]]. The 17th century was rich in popular risings, such as the [[Time of Troubles|liberation of Moscow from the Polish–Lithuanian invaders]] (1612), the [[Salt Riot]] (1648), the [[Copper Riot]] (1662), and the [[Moscow Uprising of 1682]].

The [[Russian plague of 1770-1772|Plague of 1771]] was the last massive outbreak of plague in central Russia, claiming up to 100,000 lives in Moscow alone. During the [[French invasion of Russia]] in 1812, the Muscovites [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|burned the city]] and evacuated, as [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]’s forces were approaching on 14 September. Napoleon’s ''[[Grande Armée]]'', plagued by hunger, cold and poor supply lines, was forced to retreat and was nearly annihilated by the devastating Russian winter and sporadic attacks by Russian military forces. As many as 400,000 died during this time, and only a few tens of thousands of ravaged troops returned.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZQqQz3VjlxcC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Russian Army of the Napoleonic Wars]''&quot;. Albert Seaton, Michael Youens (1979). p.29. ISBN 0-88254-167-6&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1905, the institution of the City Governor, or [[List of heads of Moscow government|Mayor]], was officially introduced in Moscow, and Alexander Adrianov became Moscow’s first official mayor. Following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], on 12 March 1918&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9A02E0DF103BEE3ABC4E52DFB5668383609EDE LENINE’S MIGRATION A QUEER SCENE], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 16, 1918&lt;/ref&gt; Moscow became the capital of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] and of the Soviet Union less than five years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;embassy-geo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianembassy.org/RUSSIA/GEOGRAF.HTM|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080511023524/http://www.russianembassy.org/RUSSIA/GEOGRAF.HTM|archivedate=2008-05-11 |title=Geographi |publisher=The Russian Embassy |accessdate=2009-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]] (the period from June 22, 1941, to May 9, 1945, known in Russia as the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]]), after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion]] of the USSR, the Soviet [[State Defense Committee]] and the General Staff of the [[Red Army]] was located in Moscow.

In 1941, sixteen divisions of the national volunteers (more than 160,000 people), twenty-five battalions (18,500 people) and four engineering regiments were formed among the Muscovites. That November, the German [[Army Group Centre|Army Group Center]] was stopped at the outskirts of the city and then driven off in the [[Battle of Moscow]]. Many factories were evacuated, together with most of the government, and from 20 October the city was declared to be under [[siege]]. Its remaining inhabitants built and supervised [[Anti-tank warfare|antitank]] defenses, while the city was subjected to air bombing. [[Joseph Stalin]] refused to leave Moscow, meaning that the general staff and the council of people's commissars remained in the city as well. Despite the siege and the bombings, the construction of Moscow's metro system continued through the war, and by the end of the war several new metro lines were opened.

Both [[German casualties in World War II|German]] and [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|Soviet casualties]] during the battle of Moscow have been a subject of debate, as various sources provide somewhat different estimates. Total casualties between 30 September 1941, and 7 January 1942, are estimated to be between 248,000 and 400,000 for the [[Wehrmacht]] and between 650,000 and 1,280,000 for the Red Army.&lt;ref&gt;''Moscow Encyclopedia'', ed.

On 1 May 1944, a medal ''For the defense of Moscow'' and in 1947 another medal ''In memory of the 800th anniversary of Moscow'' were introduced. In commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the [[victory Day (9 May)|victory over Nazi Germany]], on May&amp;nbsp;8, 1965, Moscow became one of twelve Soviet cities awarded the [[Hero City]] title.

In 1980, it hosted the [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]], which were boycotted by the [[United States]] and several other Western countries due to the Soviet Union's involvement in [[Afghanistan]] in late 1979. In 1991, Moscow was the scene of the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|failed coup attempt]] by the government members opposed to the reforms of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. When the USSR ceased to exist in the same year, Moscow still continued to be the capital of Russia.

Since then, the emergence of a [[market economy]] in Moscow has produced an explosion of Western-style retailing, services, [[architecture]], and lifestyles. In 1998, Moscow hosted the first [[World Youth Games]] - see [[1998 World Youth Games]]. This city will host the [[2013 World Championships in Athletics]].

[[File:Time zones of Europe.svg|thumb|right|Time zones of [[Europe]]]]

Moscow serves as the reference point for the timezone used in most of Central Russia, including Saint Petersburg. The areas operate in what is referred to in international standards as ''Moscow Standard Time (MSK, мск)'', which is 4 hours ahead of [[UTC]], or [[UTC+4]]. [[Daylight saving time]] is no longer observed.
{{legend|#a5ffa5|Moscow Time (UTC+4)}}

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Moscow}}

Moscow has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with warm humid summers and fairly cold winters usually lasting from mid November through the end of March.

Moscow, being in the middle latitudes of the northern hemisphere, is a place with the most expressed signs of [[global warming]]. Thus the climate becomes less stable, but the average yearly temperature is growing. So, the period from July until the beginning of August has become considerably warmer. During this time periods of extreme heat are often observed in the city (2001, 2002, 2003, [[2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat wave|2010]], 2011). At the end of January–February it is often colder (2006, 2010, 2011). The last decade was the warmest in the history of meteorological observations of Moscow.

===Jewish community===

Jews began to settle in Moscow around the 17th century. In the 19th as the [[Pale of Settlement]]  was instructed Jews were forbidden to settle in the city except for those who served in the army and after their end of service allowed to stay in the city. In 1848 there were 313 Jews in Moscow. In 1861, during the reign of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]],  &quot;useful&quot; Jews, such as scholars, merchants and artisans, were allowed to settle in Moscow and the number of Jews grew rapidly, in 1890 they numbered 40,000 men and the community built synagogues, schools and charities, many located in the Zarayadye quarter on the Moskva River and in Marina Rostcha neighborhood.&lt;ref name=&quot;kehilalinks.jewishgen.org&quot;&gt;[http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/Moskva/MoskvaHistory.htm A Brief History of the Moscow Community]. Kehilalinks.jewishgen.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, after the assassination of Alexander II in 1881, a more radical policy was adopted towards the Jews. Jewish enrollment was restricted in schools and universities and in 1891 all Jews were forced out of Moscow.

After the [[Russian revolution]] in 1917 the pale of settlement was abolished and Jews were permitted to settle again in the city, many of whom were refugees. In the 1920s and 30s, the state promoted Yiddish-language arts and literature in an effort to influence its Jewish citizens. This resulted in a brief, rich cultural flourishing exemplified by the famed Moscow State Yiddish Theatre, whose inaugural production (1921) was a staging of Sholem Aleichem's stories with sets by Marc Chagall. In 1939 there were around 250,000 Jews in Moscow.&lt;ref name=&quot;kehilalinks.jewishgen.org&quot;/&gt;

During WWII many Jews fled to inner parts of the Soviet Union but most of them returned at the end of the war and by 1970 there were again around 250,000 Jews in Moscow.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union most of Jews immigrated from the city. in that period there was a revival of Jewish religious life, the leading bodies of Russia’s Jewish organizations were centered in Moscow and a number of synagogues re-opened. In 2010 there were 53,000 Jews living in Moscow although it is estimated that there are around 150,000 people of Jewish origin in the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Moscow YIVO | Moscow&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1991 there were several antisemitic attacks in Moscow- in 2006 a neo-Nazi stabbed 9 people at the Bolshaya Bronnaya Synagogue [http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/11250/rabbi-s-son-foils-bombing-attempt-at-moscow-shul/],&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1999 there was a failed bomb attack on the same synagogue [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/12/international/12briefs.html?oref=login]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
[[File:Sk345.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], demolished during the Soviet period, was reconstructed during 1990–2000.]]
Christianity is the predominant religion in the city, of which the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] is the most popular. Moscow is Russia's capital of [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]]. It has been the country’s traditional religion and was deemed a part of Russia's &quot;historical heritage&quot; in a law passed in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Imogen|title=Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EPP3ti4hysUC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=respecting+christianity+islam+buddhism+judaism+and+other&amp;source=web&amp;ots=pppIldMuS1&amp;sig=KikE3NJkzMEdWt4rU9EoeN03-6o|accessdate=2007-12-27 |isbn=978-1-85743-137-7 |year=2003 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other religions practiced in Moscow include [[Islam in Russia|Islam]], [[Rodnovery]], [[Protestantism in Russia|Protestantism]], [[Roman Catholicism in Russia|Catholicism]], [[Old Believers]], [[Buddhism in Russia|Buddhism]], and [[Judaism]].

The [[List of Metropolitans and Patriarchs of Moscow|Patriarch of Moscow]] serves as the head of the church and resides in the [[Danilov Monastery]]. Moscow was called the &quot;city of 40 times 40 churches&quot;—''&quot;город сорока сороков церквей&quot;''—prior to 1917. In 1918 Bolsheviks' government declared Russia a secular state, which actually meant that religion was outlawed and society was to become totally atheistic. During the period of 1920-1930s a great number of churches in Moscow were demolished, including historical [[Chudov Monastery]] in Kremlin, dating from the 14 century, [[Kazan Cathedral, Moscow|Kazansky Cathedral]] on the Red Square, the [[Cathedral of Christ the Savior]], constructed in the 19th century in memory of a victory over the Napoleon army in 1812, and many more. It still continued even after WW II, in 1940-1970s, when persecutions against religion in Soviet Union became less severe. Most of the surviving churches and monasteries were closed and then used as clubs, offices, factories and even warehouses. Since the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991 many of the destroyed churches have been restored and traditional religions are once again gaining popularity. Among the churches reconstructed in 1990s is an impressive Cathedral of Christ the Savior which once more has become one of the most picturesque landmarks of the city. People over 30 years old still remember a huge open swimming-pool which was located on the site of the demolished cathedral till 1994.

[[Muslim]]s constitute 4% of the population, around 1.2–1.5 million.&lt;ref name=Spie&gt;{{cite news|author=Maxim Kireev|title=Planned Mosque Sparks Controversy in Russia|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,723799,00.html|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four [[mosque]]s in the city.

Moscow's architecture is world-renowned. Moscow is also well known as the site of [[Saint Basil's Cathedral|Saint Basil’s Cathedral]], with its elegant [[onion dome]]s, as well as the Cathedral of Christ the Savior and the [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|Seven Sisters]]. The first Kremlin was built in the middle of the twelfth century.

Medieval Moscow's design was of concentric walls and intersecting radial thoroughfares. This layout, as well as Moscow's rivers, helped shape Moscow's design in subsequent centuries.

The Kremlin was rebuilt in the 15th Century. Its towers and some of its churches were built by Italian architects, lending the city some of the aura of the renaissance. From the end of the 15th century, the city was embellished by increasing numbers of masonry structures such as monasteries, palaces, walls, towers, and churches.

The city's appearance had not changed much by the eighteenth century. Houses were made of pine and spruce logs, with shingled roofs plastered with sod or covered by birch bark. The rebuilding of Moscow in the second half of the eighteenth century was necessitated not only by constant fires, but also the needs of the nobility. Much of the wooden city was replaced by buildings in the classical style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The architecture and planning of classical Moscow: a cultural history|last=Schmidt|first=Albert J|publisher=American Philosophical Society|date=1989-04-01|pages=5–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For much of its architectural history, Moscow was dominated by Orthodox churches. However, the overall appearance of the city changed drastically during Soviet times, especially as a result of [[Joseph Stalin|Joseph Stalin's]] large-scale effort to &quot;modernize&quot; Moscow. Stalin's plans for the city included a network of broad avenues and roadways, some of them over ten lanes wide, which, while greatly simplifying movement through the city, were constructed at the expense of a great number of historical buildings and districts. Among the many casualties of Stalin's socialist reforms was the [[Sukharev Tower]], a longtime city landmark, as well as numerous mansions and commercial buildings lining the major streets. The city's newfound status as the capital of a deeply [[secular]], [[totalitarian]] nation, made religiously significant buildings especially vulnerable to demolition. Many of the city's churches, which in most cases were some of Moscow's oldest and historical buildings, were destroyed; some notable examples include the [[Kazan Cathedral, Moscow|Kazan Cathedral]] and the Cathedral of Christ the Savior. During the 1990s, both were rebuilt. Many smaller churches, however, were lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1525/city.1998.10.1.269?cookieSet=1&amp;journalCode=ciso |title=blackwell-synergy.com |publisher=blackwell-synergy.com |date=2008-06-28 |accessdate=2010-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the later Stalinist period was characterized by the curtailing of creativity and architectural innovation, the earlier post-revolutionary years saw a plethora of radical new buildings created in the city. Especially notable were the constructivist architects associated with [[VKHUTEMAS]], responsible for such landmarks as Lenin's Mausoleum. Another prominent architect was [[Vladimir Shukhov]], famous for Shukhov Tower, just one of many [[Hyperboloid structure|hyperboloid towers]] designed by Shukhov. It was built between 1919 and 1922 as a transmission tower for a Russian broadcasting company.&lt;ref name=&quot;stako&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20080527154019/http://www.stako.ru/static.php?&amp;id=mem_shukhov&amp;lang=eng&amp;data=mem_shukhov |publisher=Melnikov Institute |title=Memorial |accessdate=2006-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shukhov also left a lasting legacy to the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]] architecture of early Soviet Russia. He designed spacious elongated shop galleries, most notably the [[GUM (department store)|GUM]] department store on [[Red Square]],&lt;ref name=&quot;stako&quot;/&gt; bridged with innovative metal-and-glass vaults.
[[File:Sk328.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Triumphal Arch of Moscow]], was built from 1829-34]]

Perhaps the most recognizable contributions of the Stalinist period are the so-called [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|Seven Sisters]], comprising seven massive skyscrapers scattered throughout the city at about an equal distance from the Kremlin. A defining feature of Moscow’s skyline, their imposing form was allegedly inspired by the [[Manhattan Municipal Building]] in [[New York City]], and their style—with intricate exteriors and a large central spire—has been described as [[Stalinist architecture|Stalinist Gothic architecture]]. All seven towers can be seen from most high points in the city; they are among the tallest constructions in central Moscow apart from the [[Ostankino Tower]], which, when it was completed in 1967, was the highest free-standing land structure in the world and today remains the world’s seventy-second tallest, ranking among buildings such as the [[Burj Khalifa]] in Dubai, [[Taipei 101]] in Taiwan and the [[CN Tower]] in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of tallest buildings in the world]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet goal of providing housing for every family, and the rapid growth of Moscow's population, led to the construction of large, monotonous housing blocks. These can often be identified by age, sturdiness of construction, or ‘style’ depending on the neighborhood and the materials used. Most of these date from the post-Stalin era and the styles are often named after the leader then in power (Brezhnev, Khrushchev, etc.). They are usually badly maintained.

Although the city still has some five-story apartment buildings constructed before the mid-1960s, more recent apartment buildings are usually at least 9 floors tall, and have [[elevator]]s. It is estimated that Moscow has over twice as many elevators as New York City and four times as many as [[Chicago]]. Moslift, one of the city's major elevator operating companies, has about 1500 elevator mechanics on call, to release residents trapped in elevators.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2012/12/the-elevator-rescue-teams-of-moscow.html

Stalinist-era buildings, mostly found in the central part of the city, are massive and usually ornamented with [[Socialist realism]] motifs that imitate [[classical architecture|classical]] themes. However, small churches – almost always [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]]– found across the city provide glimpses of its past. The Old [[Arbat Street]], a popular tourist street that was once the heart of a bohemian area, preserves most of its buildings from prior to the 20th century. Many buildings found off the main streets of the inner city (behind the Stalinist [[façade]]s of [[Tverskaya Street]], for example) are also examples of [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] architecture typical of Tsarist times. [[Ostankino Palace]], [[Kuskovo]], [[Uzkoye]] and other large estates just outside Moscow originally belong to nobles from the Tsarist era, and some [[:Template:Cloisters of Moscow|convents and monasteries]], both inside and outside the city, are open to Muscovites and tourists.

Attempts are being made to restore many of the city’s best-kept examples of pre-Soviet architecture. These restored structures are easily spotted by their bright new colors and spotless façades. There are a few examples of notable, early Soviet [[avant-garde]] work too, such as the house of the architect [[Konstantin Melnikov]] in the Arbat area. Many of these restorations were criticized for alleged disrespect of historical authenticity. [[Facadism]] is also widely practiced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maps-moscow.com/index.php?chapter_id=204&amp;data_id=92&amp;do=view_single |title=Moscow Architecture Preservation Society |publisher=Maps-moscow.com |date=2006-04-17 |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later examples of interesting Soviet architecture are usually marked by their impressive size and the semi-[[Modernist]] styles employed, such as with the [[Novy Arbat]] project, familiarly known as “false teeth of Moscow” and notorious for the wide-scale disruption of a historic area in central Moscow involved in the project.

Plaques on house exteriors will inform passers-by that a well-known personality once lived there. Frequently, the plaques are dedicated to Soviet celebrities not well-known outside (or often, like with decorated generals and revolutionaries, now both inside) of Russia. There are also many &quot;museum houses&quot; of famous Russian writers, composers, and artists in the city.

Moscow's skyline is quickly modernizing with several new towers under construction.

In recent years, the city administration has been widely criticized for heavy destruction that has affected many historical buildings. As much as a third of historic Moscow has been destroyed in the past few years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/arts-and-culture/2007/11/moscow-russia-buildings |title=Appetite for destruction |publisher=New Statesman |date=2007-11-29 |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; to make space for luxury apartments and hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zagraevsky.com/moscow_engl.htm |title=Dr. Sergey Zagraevsky.

There are on average {{convert|27|m2|sp=us}} of parks per person in Moscow compared with 6 for [[Paris]], 7.5 in [[London]] and 8.6 in New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;greendress&quot;&gt;{{Ru icon}} [http://www.screen.ru/moscow/zelen.htm Green dress of Moscow]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorky Park (officially the [[Gorky Park (Moscow)|Central Park of Culture and Rest]] named after [[Maxim Gorky]]), was founded in 1928. The main part (689,000 square meters{{\}} 170&amp;nbsp;[[acre]]s)&lt;ref name=&quot;greendress&quot;/&gt; along the Moskva river contains [[Architectural glossary#Estrade|estrades]], children's attractions (including the ''Observation Wheel'' water ponds with boats and water bicycles), dancing, tennis courts and other sports facilities. It borders the [[Neskuchny Garden]] (408,000 square meters{{\}} 101&amp;nbsp;acres), the oldest park in Moscow and a former imperial residence, created as a result of the integration of three estates in the 18th century. The Garden features the Green Theater, one of the largest open amphitheaters in Europe, able to hold up to 15 thousand people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mosday.ru/photos/?neskuchniy |title=Neskuchniy Garden |publisher=Mosday.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several parks include a section known as a &quot;Park of Culture and Rest&quot;, sometimes alongside a much wilder area (this includes parks such as Izmaylovsky, Fili and Sokolniki.  Some parks are designated as Forest Parks (lesopark).

[[Izmaylovsky Park]], created in 1931, is one of the largest urban parks in the world along with [[Richmond Park]] in London. Its area of {{convert|15.34|km2|sqmi}} is six times greater than that of [[Central Park]] in New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;greendress&quot;/&gt;

[[Sokolniki Park]], named after the [[falcon]] hunting that occurred there in the past, is one of the oldest parks in Moscow and has an area of {{convert|6|km2|sqmi}}. A central circle with a large fountain is surrounded by birch, maple and elm tree alleys. A labyrinth composed of green paths lies beyond the park's ponds.

[[Losiny Ostrov National Park]] (&quot;Elk Island&quot; National Park), with a total area of more than {{convert|116|km2|sqmi}}, borders Sokolniki Park and was Russia's first national park. It is quite wild, and is also known as the &quot;city taiga&quot; - elk can be seen there.

Tsytsin Main [[Moscow Botanical Garden of Academy of Sciences|Botanical Garden of Academy of Sciences]], founded in 1945 is the largest in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ru icon}} [http://www.gbsad.ru/ The Official Site of the Main Moscow Botanical Garden]. Retrieved on 2006-07-18.&lt;/ref&gt; It covers territory of {{convert|3.61|km2|sqmi}} bordering the All-Russia Exhibition Center and contains a live exhibition of more than 20 thousand different species of plants from different parts of the world, as well as a lab for scientific research. It also contains a rosarium with 20 thousand rose bushes, a dendrarium, and an oak forest, with the average age of trees exceeding 100 years. There is also a greenhouse taking up more than 5000 square meters of land.&lt;ref name=&quot;greendress&quot;/&gt;

The All-Russian Exhibition Center (Всероссийский выставочный центр), formerly known as the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition (VSKhV) and later Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy (VDNKh), though officially named a &quot;permanent trade show&quot;, is in fact one of the most prominent examples of Stalinist-era monumental architecture. Among the large spans of recreational park areas are scores of elaborate pavilions, each representing either a branch of Soviet industry and science or one of USSR's republics. Even though, during the 1990s, it was, and for some part still is, misused as a gigantic shopping center (most of the pavilions are rented out for small businesses), it still retains the bulk of its architectural landmarks, including two monumental fountains (''Stone Flower'' and ''Friendship of Nations'') and a 360 degrees panoramic cinema.

Moscow has always been a popular destination for tourists. Some of the more famous attractions include the city's UNESCO World Heritage Site, Moscow Kremlin and Red Square,&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO considers the Moscow Kremlin and Red Square to be part of a single World Heritage Site. See also [http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/545 UNESCO's profile] on this site.&lt;/ref&gt; which was built between the 14th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/545 |title=Kremlin and Red Square, Moscow |accessdate=2006-07-15 |publisher=UNESCO |work=World Heritage List}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kolomenskoye#The White Column of Kolomenskoe|Church of the Ascension]] at Kolomenskoye, which dates from 1532, is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site and another popular attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/634 |title=Church of the Ascension, Kolomenskoye |accessdate=2006-07-15 |publisher=UNESCO |work=World Heritage List}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the [[Tretyakov Gallery|new Tretyakov Gallery]] there is a sculpture garden, Museon, often called &quot;[[the graveyard of fallen monuments]]&quot; that displays statues of the former Soviet Union that were removed from their place after its dissolution.

Other popular attractions include the [[Moscow Zoo]], a zoological garden in two sections (the valleys of two streams) linked by a bridge, with nearly a thousand species and more than 6,500 specimens.&lt;ref name=&quot;moszoo&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowzoo.ru |title=General Information |publisher=Moscow Zoo |accessdate=2006-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, the zoo attracts more than 1.2 million visitors.&lt;ref name=&quot;moszoo&quot;/&gt;

Many of Moscow's parks and landscaped gardens are protected natural environments.

===Moscow Rings===
[[File:ISS-30 Moscow, Russia.jpg|thumb|right|The concentric and outward spanning roads of Moscow, as viewed from the [[International Space Station]].]]
Moscow's road system is centered roughly around the Kremlin at the heart of the city. From there, roads generally span outwards to intersect with a sequence of circular roads (&quot;rings&quot;).

The first and innermost major ring, Bulvarnoye Koltso ([[Boulevard Ring]]), was built at the former location of the 16th century city wall around what used to be called [[Bely Gorod]] (White Town).&lt;ref name=&quot;golden-ring&quot;/&gt; The Bulvarnoye Koltso is technically not a ring; it does not form a complete circle, but instead a [[horseshoe]]-like arc that begins at the Cathedral of Christ the Savior and ends at the [[Yauza River]].

The second primary ring, located outside the bell end of the Boulevard Ring, is the Sadovoye Koltso ([[Garden Ring]]). Like the Boulevard Ring, the Garden Ring follows the path of a 16th-century wall that used to encompass part of Moscow.&lt;ref name=&quot;golden-ring&quot;/&gt;

The third ring, the Third Transport Ring, was completed in 2003 as a high-speed [[freeway]].

The Fourth Transport Ring, another freeway, is under construction to further reduce traffic congestion.

The outermost ring within Moscow is the [[MKAD|Moscow Automobile Ring Road]] (often called the ''MKAD'' from the Russian ''Московская Кольцевая Автомобильная Дорога''), which forms the approximate boundary of the city, was established in the 1950s. Outside Moscow, some of the roads encompassing the city continue to follow this circular pattern seen inside city limits.

===Overview===
[[File:Bolshoi-after-renovation.png|left|thumb|The [[Bolshoi Theatre]] after its renovation]]
[[File:Moscow International House of Music.jpg|thumb|right|[[Moscow International House of Music]]]]

One of the most notable art museums in Moscow is the Tretyakov Gallery, which was founded by [[Pavel Tretyakov]], a wealthy patron of the arts who donated a large private collection to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tretyakovgallery.ru/en/ |title=The Official site of the Tretyakov Gallery |publisher=Tretyakovgallery.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tretyakov Gallery is split into two buildings. The Old Tretyakov gallery, the original gallery in the [[Tretyakov Gallery|Tretyakovskaya]] area on the south bank of the Moskva River, houses works in the classic Russian tradition.&lt;ref name=&quot;trety&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070927110355/http://www.tretyakovgallery.ru/english/about.shtml |title=About The State Tretyakov Gallery |accessdate=2006-07-10 |publisher=The State Tretyakov Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works of famous pre-[[October Revolution|Revolutionary]] painters, such as [[Ilya Repin]], as well as the works of early Russian [[icon painting|icon painters]] can be found here. Visitors can even see rare originals by early-15th century [[iconography|iconographer]] [[Andrei Rublev]].&lt;ref name=&quot;trety&quot;/&gt;
The New Tretyakov gallery, created in Soviet times, mainly contains the works of Soviet artists, as well as of a few contemporary paintings, but there is some overlap with the Old Tretyakov Gallery for early 20th-century art. The new gallery includes a small reconstruction of [[Vladimir Tatlin]]'s famous ''[[Tatlin's Tower|Monument to the Third International]]'' and a mixture of other avant-garde works by artists like [[Kazimir Malevich]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. Socialist realism features can also be found within the halls of the New Tretyakov Gallery.

[[File:Gmii.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Pushkin Museum|Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts]]]]
Another art museum in the city of Moscow is the [[Pushkin Museum|Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts]], which was founded by, among others, the father of [[Marina Tsvetaeva]]. The Pushkin Museum is similar to the [[British Museum]] in London in that its halls are a cross-section of exhibits on world civilisations, with many copies of ancient sculptures. However, it also hosts famous paintings from every major Western era; works by [[Claude Monet]], [[Paul Cézanne]], and [[Pablo Picasso]] are present in the museum's collection.

The [[State Historical Museum]] of Russia (Государственный Исторический музей) is a museum of Russian history located between Red Square and [[Manezhnaya Square, Moscow|Manege Square]] in Moscow. Its exhibitions range from relics of the prehistoric tribes inhabiting present-day Russia, through priceless artworks acquired by members of the Romanov dynasty. The total number of objects in the museum's collection numbers is several million. The [[Polytechnical Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;See also: {{Ru icon}} [http://eng.polymus.ru/rv/ The Official Site of the Polytechnical Museum] Retrieved on 2006-07-23.

It is a part of the large historical memorial commemorating the victory in the Patriotic War of 1812 over Napoleon’s army, that includes also the [[Triumphal Arch of Moscow|triumphal arch]], erected in 1827. There is also a military history museum not to be missed, it includes statues, military hardware, and one will surely hear many interesting stories.
[[File:Wiki Red Army Theater Moscow.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Red Army Theatre|Red Army Theater]] was built in the shape of a star]]

Moscow is also the heart of the Russian performing arts, including [[Russian ballet|ballet]] and film. There are 93 theaters, 132 cinemas and 24 concert halls in Moscow. Among Moscow’s many theaters and ballet studios is the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] and the Malyi Theatre as well as [[Vakhtangov Theatre]] and [[Moscow Art Theatre]]. The repertories in a typical Moscow season are numerous and modern interpretations of classic works, whether operatic or theatrical, are quite common.

[[Memorial Museum of Astronautics]] under the [[Monument to the Conquerors of Space]] in the end of [[Cosmonauts Alley]] is the central memorial place for the Russian space officials.

Soviet films are integral to Russian film history and the [[Mosfilm]] studio was at the heart of many classic films, as it is responsible for both artistic and mainstream productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070927063958/http://www.mosfilm.ru/index.php?File=units/eng/history.htm&amp;Style=text&amp;Lang=eng |title=History of the Mosfilm concern studios foundation |publisher=MosFilm |accessdate=2006-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the continued presence and reputation of internationally renowned Russian filmmakers, the once prolific native studios are much quieter. Rare and historical films may be seen in the Salut cinema, where films from the Museum of Cinema&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museikino.ru/ |title=The Official Site of the Museum of Cinema |language={{ru icon}} |publisher=Museikino.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; collection are shown regularly.

Forty other sport complexes are located within the city, including twenty-four with artificial ice. The [[Olympic Stadium (Moscow arena)|Olympic Stadium]] was the world's first indoor arena for [[bandy]] and hosted the [[Bandy World Championships]] twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwttEMCM-Y8 |title=Russia grabs World Bandy Championship |publisher=YouTube |date=|accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moscow was again the host of the competition in 2010, this time in Krylatskoye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://translate.google.se/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;u=http://www.rusbandy.ru/stadium/2/&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhttp://www.rusbandy.ru/stadium/2/%26hl%3Den%26tbo%3Dd%26biw%3D1024%26bih%3D545&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qyW7UPq6KKri4QS03YE4&amp;ved=0CC4Q7gEwAA |title=Google Translate |publisher=Translate.google.se |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; That arena has also hosted the [[World Speed Skating Championships]].

Moscow was the host city of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], although the [[yachting]] events were held at [[Tallinn]], in present-day [[Estonia]]. Large sports facilities and the main international airport, Sheremetyevo Terminal 2, were built in preparation for the 1980 Summer Olympics. Moscow had also made a bid for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]. However, when final voting commenced on 6 July 2005, Moscow was the first city to be eliminated from further rounds. The Games were finally awarded to [[2012 Summer Olympics|London]].

The most titled [[ice hockey]] team in the Soviet Union and in the world, [[HC CSKA Moscow]] comes from Moscow. Other big ice hockey clubs from Moscow are [[HC Dynamo Moscow]], which was the second most titled team in the Soviet Union, and [[HC Spartak Moscow]].

[[FC Lokomotiv Moscow]], [[FC Dynamo Moscow]] and [[FC Torpedo Moscow]] are other professional football teams also based in Moscow.

Moscow houses several equally prominent and award-winning football, ice hockey, basketball and many other sports teams, which is rather unusual for Russia as well as the world. Because sports organisations in the Soviet Union were highly centralized in the first place, two of the best-manned Union-level teams represented defence and law-enforcing agencies: the Armed Forces (CSKA) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs (Dinamo) and a Union-wide selection (there were &quot;army&quot; and &quot;police&quot; teams in most major cities) and Moscow being the center of both the sports organisations, DoD and police headquarters, Spartak, CSKA and Dinamo were equally the most prestigious, well-manned and best-funded teams in the USSR.

Because of Moscow's cold local climate, [[winter sport]]s have a large following as well. Many of Moscow's large parks offer marked trails for skiing and frozen ponds for skating.

Moscow also hosts the annual [[Kremlin Cup]], a popular tennis tournament on both the [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] and [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] tours. It is regarded as a very prestigious tournament and is one of the ten Tier-I events on the women's tour and a host of Russian players feature every year.

[[Slava Moscow]] is a professional [[rugby union|rugby]] club, competing in the national [[Professional Rugby League]]. Former [[rugby league]] heavyweights [[RC Lokomotiv Moscow|RC Lokomotiv]] have entered the same league as of 2011. The Luzhniki Stadium will host the [[2013 Rugby World Cup Sevens]].

{{Main|Administrative divisions of Moscow}}

The entire city of Moscow is headed by one mayor ([[Sergey Sobyanin]]). The city of Moscow is divided into twelve administrative okrugs and 123 districts.

The Russian capital's specific town-planning development began to show as early as the 12th century, when the city was founded. The central part of Moscow grew by consolidating with suburbs in line with medieval principles of urban development, when strong fortress walls would gradually spread along the circle streets of adjacent new settlements. The first circular defence walls set the trajectory of Moscow's rings, laying the groundwork for the future town-planning of the Russian capital.

The following fortifications served as the city's circular defense boundaries at some point in history: the Kremlin walls, Zemlyanoy Gorod (Earthwork Town), the Kamer-Kollezhsky Rampart, the Garden Ring, and the small railway ring. The Moscow Automobile Ring Road (MKAD) has been Moscow's boundary since 1960. Also in the form of a circle are the main Moscow subway line, the Ring Line, and the so-called Third Automobile Ring, which was completed in 2005. Hence, the characteristic radial-circle planning continues to define Moscow's further development. However, contemporary Moscow has also engulfed a number of territories outside the [[Moscow Ring Road|Ring Road]], such as Solntsevo, Butovo, and the town of [[Zelenograd]]. A part of Moscow Oblast's territory was merged into Moscow on July&amp;nbsp;1, 2012; as a result, Moscow is no longer surrounded by Moscow Oblast and now has a border with [[Kaluga Oblast]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Merger&quot;&gt;Official website of the Government of Moscow. [http://www.mos.ru/about/borders/ Draft of adopted measures of the capital and oblast governments with regards to the expansion of the borders of Moscow] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all, Moscow gained about {{convert|1500|km2|sp=us}} and 230,000 inhabitants. Moscow's Mayor Sergey Sobyanin lauded the expansion that will help Moscow and the neighboring region, a &quot;mega-city&quot; of twenty million people, to develop &quot;harmonically&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merger2&quot;/&gt;

All administrative okrugs and districts have their own [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] and flags as well as individual heads of the area.

In addition to the districts, there are Territorial Units with Special Status. These usually include areas with small or no permanent populations. Such is the case with the All-Russia Exhibition Centre, the [[Moscow Botanical Garden of Academy of Sciences|Botanical Garden]], large parks, and industrial zones. In recent years, some territories have been merged with different districts. There are no ethnic-specific regions in Moscow, as in the [[Chinatown]]s that exist in some [[North America]]n and [[East Asia]]n cities. And although districts are not designated by income, as with most cities, those areas that are closer to the city center, metro stations or green zones are considered more prestigious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Цены на Квартиры в Москве по Административным Районам и Станциям Метро|url=http://www.metrinfo.ru/area/|work=Metrinfo.ru|accessdate=27 September 2010|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moscow also hosts some of the government bodies of [[Moscow Oblast]], although the city itself is not a part of the oblast.&lt;ref name=&quot;MoscowO&quot;&gt;According to Article&amp;nbsp;24 of the [[Charter of Moscow Oblast]], the government bodies of the oblast are located in the city of Moscow and throughout the territory of Moscow Oblast. However, Moscow is not officially named the administrative centre of the oblast.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the map, Moscow that until the 2011 enlargement had the form of an irregular circle, turned into a &quot;comet&quot; and, interrupting its development according to a circular principle, began to grow along the axis. The city had expanded by adding territories in the southwest: twenty-one municipal formations, including two urban okrugs ([[Troitsk]] and [[Shcherbinka]]), and nineteen urban and rural settlements that used to be a part of Podolsky, Leninsky, and [[Naro-Fominsky District]]s of Moscow Oblast. Part of the territory of Odintsovsky and Krasnogorsky Districts was also added to the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itar-tass.com/en/c154/495470.html &quot;Putin to hold meeting on Moscow enlargement&quot;, August 14, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moscow has the lowest unemployment rate of all [[federal subjects of Russia]], standing at just 1% in 2010, compared to the national average of 7%. The average monthly wage in the city is 41,600 roubles (), which is almost twice the national average of 21,800 rubles (), and the fourth highest among the federal subjects of Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;bofit_42_2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bof.fi/NR/rdonlyres/A0C226F8-3D3F-4B6F-8AA3-B621E963D4CC/0/w201042.pdf|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5tmjrHFzM|archivedate=2010-10-27|title=BOFIT Weekly 42/2010|publisher=Bank of Finland's Institute for Economies in Transition|date=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moscow is the undisputed financial center of Russia and home to the country's largest banks and many of its largest companies, such as natural gas giant [[Gazprom]]. Moscow accounts for 17% of retail sales in Russia and for 13% of all construction activity in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;bofit_42_2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gks.ru/gis/tables%5CUROV-7.htm |publisher=Federal Service on State Statistics |title=Average monthly salaries |accessdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]], various business sectors in Moscow have shown exponential rates of growth. Many new business centers and office buildings have been built in recent years, but Moscow still experiences shortages in office space. As a result, many former industrial and research facilities are being reconstructed to become suitable for office use.

Overall, economic stability has improved in recent years; nonetheless, crime and corruption continue still hinder business development.

The Cherkizovskiy marketplace was the largest marketplace in Europe, with a daily turnover of about thirty million dollars and about ten thousand venders&lt;ref&gt;{{Ru icon}} {{cite news |url=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071106080038/http://www.newtimes.ru/artical.asp?n=3111&amp;art_id=6991|last=Aleksandrov |first=Yuri |date=2005-12-11 |title=Новые лимитчики |publisher=New Times |accessdate=2006-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; from different countries (including [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Turkey]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[India]]). It was administratively divided into twelve parts and covers a wide sector of the city. Since July 2009 it has been closed.

In 2008, Moscow had 74 billionaires with an average wealth of $5.9 billion, which placed it above New York's 71 billionaires. However, as of 2009, there are only 27 billionaires in Moscow compared with New York's 55 billionaires. Overall, Russia lost 52 billionaires during the recession [[List of Russian billionaires by net worth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.financemarkets.co.uk/2009/02/16/russia's-billionaires-hit-by-financial-crisis/ |publisher=www.financemarkets.co.uk |title=Russia's billionaires hit by financial crisis |accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topping the list of Russia's billionaires in 2009 is [[Mikhail Prokhorov]] with $9.5 billion, ahead of the more famous [[Roman Abramovich]] with $8.5 billion, in [[:ru:Список богатейших бизнесменов России (2009)|2nd place]]. Prokhorov's holding company, &quot;ОНЭКСИМ&quot; (''ONÈKSIM'') group, owns huge assets in hydrogen energy, nanotechnology, traditional energy, precious metals sector, while Abramovich, since selling his oil company Sibneft to Russian state-controlled gas giant Gazprom in 2005, has bought up steel and mining assets. He also owns [[Chelsea F.C.]]. Russia's richest woman remains [[Yelena Baturina]], the 50-year-old second wife of Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov. [[Oleg Deripaska]], the 1st on this list in 2008 with $28 billion, was only 10th in 2009 with [[:ru:Список богатейших бизнесменов России (2009)|$3.5 billion]]. Based on [[Forbes]]' 2011 list of the world's billionaires, Moscow is the city with the most billionaires in the world, with 79 from 115 in all of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.rickey.org/mexicos-carlos-slim-still-tops-forbes-richest-list/2638 |title=Mexico's Carlos Slim still tops Forbes' richest list |date=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[nouveau riche]], also called the &quot;New Russians&quot;, often in a derogatory sense, have a reputation for flaunting their wealth; the avenues for doing so have also increased in recent times - a sense of fashion and self-consciousness has instilled itself through the many [[haute couture]] and [[haute cuisine]] spots in Moscow.

===Industry===
Primary [[industry|industries]] in Moscow include the [[chemical industry|chemical]], [[metallurgy]], [[Food industry|food]], [[textile]], [[furniture]], [[energy production]], [[software development]] and [[machine]]ry industries.

The [[Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant]] is one of the leading producers of military and civil helicopters in the world. [[Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center]] produces various space equipment, including modules for space stations [[Mir]], [[Salyut]] and the [[ISS]] as well as [[Proton (rocket)|Proton launch vehicles]] and military [[ICBM]]s. [[Sukhoi]], [[Ilyushin]], [[Mikoyan]], [[Tupolev]] and [[Yakovlev]] aircraft design bureaus also situated in Moscow. Automobile plants [[ZiL]] and [[AZLK]], as well as the Voitovich Rail Vehicle plant, are situated in Moscow and [[Metrovagonmash]] metro wagon plant is located just outside the city limits. The [[Poljot|Poljot Moscow watch factory]] produces reliable military, professional and sport watches well known in Russia and abroad. [[Yuri Gagarin]] in his trip into space used &quot;Shturmanskie&quot;, produced by this factory.

There are also many other industries located just outside the city of Moscow, as well as many microelectronic industries in Zelenograd.

Gazprom, the largest extractor of [[natural gas]] in the world and the largest [[Economy of Russia|Russian company]], has head offices also in Moscow, as well as many other oil, gas and electricity companies.

Moscow also hosts headquarters of various software development companies, including such as:
* [[1C Company]]—business software and games producer
* [[ABBYY]] software house—developer of text recognition and translation software,
* [[Akella]]—game developer company
* [[Kaspersky Lab]]—worldwide-known producer of anti-virus software,

Additionally, some industry is now being transferred out of the city to improve the ecological state of the city. Nevertheless, Moscow remains one of Russia's major industrial centers.

===Living costs===

During [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times, apartments were lent to people by the government according to the square meters-per-person norm (some groups, including people's artists, heroes and prominent scientists had bonuses according to their honors). [[Private ownership]] of apartments was limited until the 1990s, when people were permitted to secure property rights to the places they inhabited. Since the Soviet era, estate owners have had to pay the service charge for their residences, a fixed amount based on persons per living area.

Due to the current economic situation, the price of [[real estate]] in Moscow continues to rise. Today, one could expect to pay $4000 on average per square meter (11&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;ft) on the outskirts of the city&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waybackmachine.org/*/http://rus.intermark.ru/about-us/press/mt_20_10/ |title=US$4,500 for a Square Meter of Apartment Space. The Moscow Times |publisher=Waybackmachine.org |date=2011-07-19 |accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; or US$6,500–$8,000 per square meter in a prestigious district. The price sometimes may exceed US$40,000 per square meter in a flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ru icon}} [http://www.regnum.ru/news/643249.html The absolute record of realty cost is broken]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Humphries |first=Conor |title=Dividing the Spoils of the Boom |url=http://www.stroi.ru/eng/default.aspx?d=5&amp;dr=901&amp;m=13 |publisher=The Moscow Times |date=2006-06-20 |accessdate=2006-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mosday.ru/info/article.php?realty-2006 |title=Costs of realty in Moscow (2006) |publisher=Mosday.ru |language=Russian |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It costs about US$2500 per month to rent a 1-bedroom apartment and about US$1500 per month for a studio in the center of Moscow.

A typical one-bedroom apartment is about thirty square meters (323&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;ft), a typical two-bedroom apartment is forty-five square meters (485&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;ft), and a typical three-bedroom apartment is seventy square meters (753&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;ft). Many cannot move out of their apartments, especially if a family lives in a two-room apartment originally granted by the state during the Soviet era. Some city residents have attempted to cope with the cost of living by renting their apartments while staying in [[dacha]]s (country houses) outside the city.

In 2006, Mercer Human Resources Consulting named Moscow the world's [[List of most expensive cities for expatriate employees|most expensive city for expatriate employees]], ahead of perennial winner Tokyo, due to the stable [[Russian ruble]] as well as increasing housing prices within the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/06/23/pf/expensive_cities/index.htm |last=Sahadi |first=Jeanne |date=2006-06-23 |accessdate=2006-07-04 |publisher=CNNMoney |title=World's most expensive cities}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moscow also ranked first in the 2007 edition and 2008 edition of the survey.

Although Moscow has a number of famous Soviet-era higher educational institutions, most of which are more oriented towards [[engineering]] or the fundamental sciences, in recent years Moscow has seen a significant growth in the number of commercial and private institutions that offer classes in [[Business school|business]] and [[management]]. Many state institutions have expanded their education scope and introduced new courses or departments. Institutions in Moscow, as well as the rest of post-Soviet Russia, have begun to offer new international certificates and postgraduate degrees, including the [[Master of Business Administration]]. [[Student exchange program]]s with different (especially, [[Europe]]an) countries have also become widespread in Moscow's universities, while many schools within the Russian capital also offer seminars, lectures and courses for corporate employees and businessmen.

Moscow is one of the largest science centers in Russia. The headquarters of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] are located in Moscow as well as numerous research and applied science institutions.
The [[Kurchatov Institute]], Russia's leading research and development institution in the fields of nuclear energy, where the first [[nuclear reactor]] in Europe was built, the [[Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics]], [[Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics]], [[Institute for Physical Problems|Kapitza Institute for Physical Problems]] and [[Steklov Institute of Mathematics]] are all situated in Moscow.

In regards to primary and secondary education, [[Clifford J. Levy]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said &quot;Moscow has some strong public schools, but the system as a whole is dispiriting, in part because it is being corroded by the corruption that is a post-Soviet scourge. Parents often pay bribes to get their children admitted to better public schools. There are additional payoffs for good grades.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Levy1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Clifford J. |last=Levy |authorlink=Clifford J.

==Transportation==
{{main|Transportation in Moscow}}

===Air===
There are five primary commercial airports serving Moscow:
[[File:Sheremyatervo-3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|View to [[Sheremetyevo International Airport]] terminal &quot;D&quot;, bottom - center of Moscow]]
* [[Sheremetyevo International Airport]] (SVO)
* [[Domodedovo International Airport]] (DME)
* [[Bykovo Airport]] (BKA)
* [[Ostafyevo International Airport]]
* [[Vnukovo International Airport]] (VKO)

Sheremetyevo International Airport is the most common entry point for foreign visitors, handling sixty percent of all international flights.&lt;ref name=&quot;4airports&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.go-russia.com/angela.php |publisher=Go-Russia |title=Moscow Airports |date=2007-10-07 |accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domodedovo International Airport is the leading airport in Russia in terms of passenger throughput, and is the primary gateway to long-haul domestic and CIS destinations and its international traffic rivals Sheremetyevo's. The three other airports particularly offer flights within Russia and to and from states from the former Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/travel/arriving/byplane.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060708154208/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/travel/arriving/byplane.html |archivedate=2006-07-08 |accessdate=2006-07-03 |title=Getting to Russia: Arriving by Plane |publisher=The Moscow Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moscow's airports vary in distances from the MKAD beltway: Bykovo is the farthest, at {{convert|35|km|0|abbr=on}}; Domodedovo is next at {{convert|22|km|0|abbr=on}}; Vnukovo is {{convert|11|km|0|abbr=on}}; Sheremetyevo is {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}}; and Ostafievo, the nearest, is about {{convert|8|km|mi}} from MKAD.&lt;ref name=&quot;4airports&quot;/&gt;

There are also several smaller airports near Moscow, such as [[Myachkovo Airport]], intended for private aircraft, helicopters and charters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ru icon}} [http://www.sostav.ru/news/2004/08/18/72/ Airport Myachkovo changed the owners]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water===

Moscow also has two passenger terminals, ([[South River Terminal]] and [[North River Terminal]] or Rechnoy vokzal), on the river and regular ship routes and cruises along the Moskva and [[Oka River|Oka]] rivers, which are used mostly for entertainment. The North River Terminal, built in 1937, is also the main hub for long-range river routes. There are also three freight ports serving Moscow.

===Railway===
[[File:Sapsan in Moscow, 2010.jpg|thumb|right|The high-speed [[Sapsan]] train links Moscow with [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Nizhny Novgorod]]]]
Moscow employs several train stations to serve the city. Moscow's nine rail terminals (or ''vokzals'')&amp;nbsp; are:
* [[Belorussky Rail Terminal]]
* [[Kazansky Rail Terminal]]
* [[Kiyevsky Rail Terminal]]
* [[Kursky Rail Terminal]]
* [[Leningradsky Rail Terminal]]
* [[Paveletsky Rail Terminal]]
* [[Rizhsky Rail Terminal]]
* [[Savyolovsky Rail Terminal]]
* [[Yaroslavsky Rail Terminal]]
The terminals are located close to the city center, along the metro ringline 5 or close to it, and all connect to a metroline to the centre of town. Each station handles trains from different parts of Europe and Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;mostimestrain&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/travel/arriving/bytrain.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060708154220/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/travel/arriving/bytrain.html |archivedate=2006-07-08 |publisher=The Moscow Times |title=Getting to Russia: Arriving by Train |accessdate=2006-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many smaller railway stations in Moscow. As train tickets are relatively cheap, they are the preferred mode of travelling for Russians, especially when departing to Saint Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city. Moscow is also the western terminus of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], which traverses nearly {{convert|9300|km|precision=0}} of Russian territory to [[Vladivostok]] on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast.

Suburbs and satellite cities are also connected by commuter [[elektrichka]] (electric rail) network. Elektrichkas depart from each of these terminals to the nearby (up to {{convert|140|km|mi|0|disp=or|abbr=on}}) large railway stations.

The [[Moscow Little Ring Railway]] is only used for cargo traffic. There are plans to use the railway for passenger trafic.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Moscow metro general plan 2025.jpg metro general plan 2025]]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a connecting railway line on the North side of the town wich connects Belorussky terminal with other railway lines. This is used by some suburban trains.

===Metro===
{{Main|Moscow Metro}}
[[File:Moscow metro map en sb.svg|thumb|[[Moscow Metro]], 2012]]
Local transport includes the Moscow Metro, a [[Rapid transit|metro]] system famous for its art, [[mural]]s, [[mosaic]]s, and ornate [[chandelier]]s. When it first opened in 1935, the system had just two lines. Today, the Moscow Metro comprise twelve lines, mostly underground with a total of 188 stations. The Metro is one of the deepest subway systems in the world; for instance the [[Park Pobedy (Moscow Metro)|Park Pobedy]] station, completed in 2003, at {{convert|84|m}} underground, has the longest [[escalator]]s in Europe. The Moscow Metro is [[Metro systems by annual passenger rides|one of the world's busiest]] metro systems, serving more than nine million passengers daily.&lt;ref name=&quot;metro&quot;&gt;{{Ru icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.mosmetro.ru/pages/page_0.php?id_page=99 |title=Московский метрополитен |accessdate=2006-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facing serious transportation problems, Moscow has extensive plans for expanding its Metro.

===Bus and trolleybus===
As Metro stations outside the city center are far apart in comparison to other cities, up to {{convert|4|km}}, an extensive bus network radiates from each station to the surrounding residential zones. Moscow also has a bus terminal for long-range and intercity passenger buses ([[Moscow Central Bus Terminal|Central Bus Terminal]]) with daily turnover of about 25 thousand passengers serving about 40% of long-range bus routes in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;See also: {{Ru icon}} [http://www.kvartirant.ru/news/?news_id=10891&amp;date=12.05.2006&amp;date2=2006-05-12] Realty news. Retrieved on 2006-07-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Every major street in the city is served by at least one bus route. Many of these routes are doubled by a [[trolleybus]] routes and have trolley wires over them.
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Moscow Bus.jpg
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Monorail===
{{Main|Moscow Monorail}}
[[File:Monorail Moskau - Einfahrt in Station Telezentrum.jpg|thumb|Moscow Monorail]]
There is also a short [[Moscow Monorail|monorail line]], operated by the Moscow Metro company. The line connects [[Timiryazevskaya (Metro)|Timiryazevskaya]] metro station and [[Sergeya Eisensteina Street]], passing close to [[All-Russia Exhibition Centre|VVTs]]. The line opened in 2004.

===Tram===
Moscow has an extensive tram system, which first opened in 1899. The newest line was built in 1984. Its daily usage by Muscovites is low, making up for approximately 5% of trips, because many vital connections in the network have been withdrawn.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Trams still remain important in some districts as feeders to Metro stations. The trams also provide important cross links between metro lines, for example between [[Universitet (Moscow Metro)|University station]] of [[Sokolnicheskaya Line]] (#1 red line) and [[Profsoyuznaya (Moscow Metro)|Profsoyuznaya station]] of [[Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya Line]] (#6 orange line) or between [[Voykovskaya]] and [[Strogino (Moscow Metro)|Strogino]].

There are three separate tram networks in the city:
* Krasnopresnenskoye depot network with the westernmost point at Strogino (depot location) and the easternmost point near platform Dmitrovskaya. This network became separated in 1973, but until 1997 it could easily have been reconnected by about one kilometer of track and three switches. The network has the highest usage in Moscow and no weak points based on turnover except to-depot lane (passengers serviced by bus) and tram ring at Dmitrovskaya (because now is neither a normal transfer point nor a repair terminal).
* The Apakov depot services the south-western part from the Varshavsky lane - Simferopolsky boulevard in the east to the University station in the west and Boulevard lane at the center. This network is connected only by the four-way Dubininskaya and Kozhevnicheskaaya street. A second connection by Vostochnaya (Eastern) street was withdrawn in 1987 due to fire at Dinamo plant and has not been recovered, remains lost (Avtozavodsky bridge) at 1992. The network may be serviced anyway by another depot (now route 35, 38).
* Main three depot networks with railway gate and tram-repair plant

In addition, tram advocates have suggested that the new rapid transit services (metro to City, Butovo light metro, Monorail) would be more effective as at-grade tram lines and that the current problems with trams are only due to poor management and operation, not the technical properties of trams. New tram models have been developed for the Moscow network despite the lack of expansion.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Taxi===
In Russia and Moscow, the difference between hailing a cab and simply hitchhiking is blurred. It's an old Russian tradition for drivers to offer rides to strangers for a fee. Generally, wherever you are, at any time of day or night, you can get a 'cab' in a matter of minutes or seconds by holding out your hand. Commercial taxi services are also available. In addition, [[route taxi]]s are also in widespread use.

===Roads===
There are over 2.6 million cars in the city on a daily basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;mosru-stats&quot;/&gt; Recent years have seen the growth in the number of cars, which have caused traffic jams and lack of parking space to become major problems.

The MKAD, along with the [[Third Ring Road (Moscow)|Third Transport Ring]] and the future Fourth Transport Ring, is one of only three [[freeway]]s that run within Moscow city limits. However, as one can easily observe from a map of the Moscow area, there are several other roadway systems that form [[concentric circles]] around the city.

==Future development==
[[File:Moscow, City May 2010 03.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Moscow International Business Center]]]]
[[File:Third Ring Road (Moscow).JPG|right|thumb|[[Third Ring Road (Moscow)|Third Ring]] near [[Moscow International Business Center|MIBC]]]]

The &quot;[[Moscow International Business Center]]&quot; is a projected new part of central Moscow. Geographically situated in [[Presnensky District]], located at the Third Ring, the Moscow City area is under intense development.
The goal of MIBC &quot;Moscow City&quot; is to create a zone, the first in Russia, and in all of Eastern Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Москва-Сити начинается строительство Города столиц |url=http://lenta.ru/news/2005/12/23/city/|agency=Lenta.ru|language=Russian |work=|publisher=|date=December 23, 2005|accessdate=May 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; that will combine business activity, living space and entertainment. It will be a city within a city. The project was conceived by the Moscow government in 1992.

The construction of MIBC &quot;Moscow-City&quot; takes place on the Krasnopresnenskaya embankment. The whole project takes up to 1 square kilometer (247&amp;nbsp;acres). This area is the only spot in downtown Moscow that can accommodate a project of this magnitude. Today, most of the buildings there are old factories and industrial complexes.

The [[Federation Tower]], now being built is to be completed in 2016, will become the tallest building in Europe when completed. Also to be included in the project are a [[water park]] and other recreational facilities; business and entertainment complexes, numerous prestigious office and residential buildings, the transport network and the [[City Hall and City Duma|new site of the Moscow government]]. The construction of four new metro stations in the territory has already been completed, two of which have already opened and two others are reserved for future metro lines crossing MIBC, some additional stations were planned. A rail shuttle service, directly connecting MIBC with the [[Sheremetyevo International Airport]] is also planned. Major thoroughfares through Moscow-City are the Third Ring and [[Kutuzovsky Prospekt]]. Three metro stations were initially planned for the [[Filyovskaya Line]]. The station Delovoi Tsentr opened in 2005, and was later renamed &quot;[[Vystavochnaya]]&quot; in 2009. The branch extended to the [[Mezhdunarodnaya (Moscow Metro)|Mezhdunarodnaya]] station in 2006, and all work on third station, Dorogomilovskaya (between [[Kiyevskaya (Filyovskaya)|Kiyevskaya]] and Delovoi Tsentr), has been postponed. It was recently announced that there are plans to extend the branch as far as the [[Savyolovskaya]] station, on the [[Serpukhovsko-Timiryazevskaya Line]].

A Fourth Ring freeway (in addition to Moscow Automobile Ring Road, [[Garden Ring]] and the Third Ring) has been designed and is being built around Moscow. It is to be completed by 2012 and will have a total length of {{convert|61|km|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/auto/2006/02/27_a_551381.shtml |title=Вербепрне Йнкэжн Опнахбюер Днпнцс - Цюгерю.Ru |publisher=Gazeta.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prime-realty.ru/cmi/c5/5.146..htm |title=Четвертое транспортное кольцо Москвы |language=Russian|publisher=Prime-realty.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roads.ru/4tk/4tk_rbk.php |title=Plan of the Fourth Transport Road |publisher=Roads.ru |date=|accessdate=2010-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rail connection linking the international airports at Vnukovo and [[Sheremetyevo Airport|Sheremetyevo]] with downtown terminals is also planned.

In March 2009 the Russian business newspaper &quot;Kommersant&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kommersant.ru/ |title=Издательский дом &quot;Коммерсантъ&quot; |publisher=Kommersant.ru |date=|accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=1087182 |title=Ъ-Санкт-Петербург – Девелопер на перепутье |publisher=Kommersant.ru |date=|accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ольга Ъ-Сичкарь |url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=1129754 |title=Ъ – Mirax Group проявила дар убеждения |publisher=Kommersant.ru |date=|accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc-rss.aspx?DocsID=1139873 |title=Ъ—ПИК построил меньше, а AFI Development получила убыток |publisher=Kommersant.ru |date=|accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that because of the Worldwide Economic Crisis, which started in 2008 and spread globally, many of the construction projects in Moscow (especially in the &quot;Moscow International Business Center&quot;) are frozen and may be cancelled altogether—like the ambitious &quot;Russia Tower&quot; in &quot;Moscow-city&quot;. Many of yesterday's monstrous development groups are now in a near-bankrupt state like the Mirax-group or AFI Development.

'''Tehran''' ({{pronunciation|Tehran.ogg}}) ({{lang-fa|تهران}} ''Tehrān''; {{IPA-fa|tehˈɾɒːn|pron}}), sometimes spelled '''Teheran''', is the [[Capital city|capital]] of [[Iran]] and [[Tehran Province]]. With a population of around 8.3 million and surpassing 14 million in the wider metropolitan area, Tehran is Iran's [[List of Iranian cities by population|largest city and urban area]], and one of the largest cities in [[Western Asia]].

In the 20th and 21st centuries, Tehran has been the subject to mass migration of people from all around Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/585619/Tehran |title=Tehran (Iran) : Introduction – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com|accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is home to many historic [[mosque]]s, [[Church (building)|churches]], [[synagogue]]s and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[fire temple]]s. However, modern structures, notably [[Azadi Tower|Azadi (Freedom) Tower]] and the [[Milad Tower]], have come to be symbolise the city. Tehran is ranked 29th in the world by the population of its [[metropolitan area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/urban_2006_1.html |title=World's largest urban areas in 2006 (1) |publisher=City Mayors |date= |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout [[history of Iran|Iran's history]], the capital has been moved many times, and Tehran is [[List of former national capitals#Central and South-West Asia|the 32nd national capital of Iran]] although it has been Iran's capital for about 220 years.  Although a variety of unofficial languages are spoken, notably [[Azeri Turkish]], roughly 98% of the population understand or speak [[Persian language|Persian]].&lt;ref&gt;Mareike Schuppe, &quot;Coping with Growth in Tehran: Strategies of Development Regulation&quot;, GRIN Verlag, 2008. pp 13: &quot;Besides Persian, there are Azeri, Armenian, Jewish and Afghani communities in Tehran.

==History==
{{See also|Timeline of Tehran history}}

An important historical city in the area of modern-day Tehran, now absorbed by it, is known as [[Rey, Iran|''Ray'']], which is etymologically connected to the [[Old Persian]] and [[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''Ragha''.&lt;ref&gt;Chahryar Adle, Bernard Hourcade, [http://books.google.com/books?id=BjJuAAAAMAAJ &quot;Téhéran: capitale bicentenaire&quot;], Institut français de recherche en Iran, 1992. p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;  The city was a major area of the Iranian speaking Medes and Achaemenids.  

In the Zoroastrian [[Avesta]], [[Vendidad|Videvdad]], i, 15, Ragha is mentioned as the twelfth sacred place created by [[Ahura-Mazda]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Minorsky&quot;&gt;V. Minorsky, C.E. Bosworth, &quot;Al-Rayy&quot;, Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Edition, vol 8:471–473&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Old Persian]] inscriptions ([[Behistun Inscription|Behistun]] 2, 10–18), Ragha appears as a province.  From Ragha, [[Darius the Great]] sent reinforcements to his father [[Hystaspes (father of Darius I)|Hystaspes]] (Vishtaspa), who was putting down the rebellion in [[Parthia]] (Behistun 3, 1–10).&lt;ref name=&quot;Minorsky&quot;/&gt;  

The [[Damavand]] mountain located near the city also appears in the [[Shahnameh]] as the place where Freydun bounds the dragon-fiend [[Zahhak]]. Damavand is important in Persian mythological and legendary events.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tafazolli&quot;&gt;A. Tafazolli, &quot;In Iranian Mythology&quot; in Encyclopaedia Iranica&lt;/ref&gt; Kayūmarṯ, the Zoroastrian prototype of human beings and the first king in the Shahnameh, was said to have resided in Damāvand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tafazolli&quot;/&gt;  In these legends, the foundation of the city of Damavand was attributed to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tafazolli&quot;/&gt;  [[Arash]], the archer who sacrificed his body by giving all his strength to the arrow that demarcated [[Iran]] and [[Turan]], shot his arrow from Mount Damāvand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tafazolli&quot;/&gt;  This Persian legend was celebrated every year in the [[Tiregan]] festival.  A popular feast is reported to have been held in the city of Damavand on 7 Šawwāl 1230, or in Gregorian calendar, 31 August 1815.  During the alleged feast the people celebrated the anniversary of Zahhak's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tafazolli&quot;/&gt;  In the Zoroastrian legends, the tyrant Zahhak is to finally be killed by the Iranian hero Garšāsp before the final days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tafazolli&quot;/&gt;  

In some Middle Persian texts, Ray (Ragha) is given as the birthplace of [[Zoroaster]]&lt;ref&gt;Vesta Sarkhosh Curtis, Sarah Stewart, &quot;Birth of the Persian Empire&quot;, I.B.Tauris, 2005. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; although modern historians generally place the birth of Zoraster in [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]].  In one Persian tradition, the legendary king Manūčehr was born in Damavand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tafazolli&quot;/&gt;

During the [[Sassanid]] era, [[Yazdegerd III]] in 641 issued from Ray his last appeal to the nation before fleeing to [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Minorsky&quot;/&gt; The sanctuary of Bibi Shahr-Banu situated in modern Tehran spur and accessible only to women is associated with the memory of the daughter of Yazdagird who, according to tradition, became the wife of al-Husayn b. Ali, the third [[Shi'ite]] Imam.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minorsky&quot;/&gt;  Ray was the fief of the Persian Mihran family and Siyawakhsh the son of Mihran the son of Bahram Chubin resisted the Arab invasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minorsky&quot;/&gt;  Because of this resistance, when the Arabs captured Ray, they ordered the town to be destroyed and ordered Farrukhan b. Zaynabi b. Kula to rebuild the town.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minorsky&quot;/&gt; 

In the 10th century, Ray is described in detail in the work of Islamic geographers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minorsky&quot;/&gt;  Despite the interest of [[Baghdad]] displayed in Ray, the number of [[Arabs]] there was insignificant, and the population consisted of [[Persian people|Persians]] of all classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minorsky&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Bulddan, Yackubl, 276)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oghuz Turks|Ghuzz Turks]] laid Ray to waste in 1035 and in 1042, but the city recovered during the Saljuqid and [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarazmian]] era.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minorsky&quot;/&gt;  The Mongols laid Ray to complete waste and according to Islamic historians of the era, virtually all of its inhabitants were massacared.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minorsky&quot;/&gt;  The city is mentioned in later Safavid chronicles&lt;ref name=&quot;Minorsky&quot;/&gt; as an unimportant city.

The origin of the name Tehran is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Behrooz, Samira; Karampour, Katayoun. [http://universityandheritage.net/SIFU/XII_Hanoi_2009/en/abstracts/html/14.html ''A Research on Adaptation of Historic Urban Landscapes ; The Case of The Historical City of Tehran.''] Tehran Historical City Office.&lt;/ref&gt; Tehran was well known as a village in the 9th century, but was less well-known than the city of [[Ray, Iran|Rhages]] (Ray) which was flourishing nearby in the early era. Najm al-Din Razi known as Dayya gives the population of Ray as 500,000 before the Mongol invasion.  In the 13th century, following the destruction of Ray by [[Mongols]], many of its inhabitants escaped to Tehran. In some sources of the early era, the city is mentioned as &quot;Rhages's Tehran&quot;. The city is later mentioned in [[Hamdollah Mostowfi]]'s ''Nuz'hat al-Qulub'' (written in 1340) as a famous village.

[[File:Azadi Monument.jpg|thumb|Azadi tower]]
There is also a shrine there, dedicated to commemorate Princess [[Shahr Banu]], eldest daughter of the last ruler of the [[Sassanid Empire]]. She gave birth to [[Ali Zayn al Abidin]], the fourth holy Imam of the [[Shia]] faith. This was through her marriage to [[Husayn ibn Ali]], the grandson of [[Muhammad]], the prophet of [[Islam]]. A nearby mountain is also named after her. However, some sources attribute the shrine to the goddess of water and fertility, [[Anahita]], claiming it was renamed in Islamic times to protect it from any possible harm after the conversion of Iranians to Islam.

Don [[Ruy Gonzáles de Clavijo]], a [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] ambassador, was probably the first European to visit Tehran, stopping in July 1404, while on a journey to [[Samarkand]] (now in [[Uzbekistan]]) the capital of [[Timur]], who ruled Iran at the time. At this time, the city of Tehran was unwalled.

In the early 18th century, [[Karim Khan|Karim Khan Zand]] ordered a [[palace]], and a government office to be built in Tehran, possibly to declare the city his capital, but later moved his government to [[Shiraz]]. Tehran finally became the capital of [[Persian Empire|Iran]] in 1795, when the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] king [[Agha Mohammad Khan]] was crowned in the city. It remains the capital to this day.

In the 1920s and 30s, the city essentially was rebuilt from scratch under the rule of the [[Shah of Iran]], [[Reza Shah]] Pahlavi. Reza Shah believed that ancient buildings such as large parts of the [[Golestan Palace]], Takieh-ye Dowlat, the [[Toopkhaneh|Toopkhaneh Square]], the city fortifications and the old citadel among others should not be part of a modern city. They were systematically destroyed and modern buildings in the pre-islamic Iranian style, such as the National Bank, the Police Headquarters, the Telegraph Office and the Military Academy were built in their place. The [[Tehran Bazaar]] was divided in half and many historic buildings were destroyed in order to build wide straight avenues in the capital. Many Persian gardens also fell victim to new construction projects.

During [[World War II]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] troops entered the city. Tehran was the site of the [[Tehran Conference]] in 1943, attended by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Soviet Premier]] [[Joseph Stalin]], and [[British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]].

In the 1960s and 70s Tehran was rapidly developing under the reign of [[Shah]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]]. Modern buildings altered the face of Tehran and ambitious projects were envisioned for the following decades. The majority of these projects were continued after the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic revolution]] of 1979 when Tehran's urbanization had reached its peak, and the new government started many other new projects, such as [[Milad Tower]].

During the 1980–88 [[Iran–Iraq War]], Tehran was the target of repeated [[Scud]] missile attacks and air strikes.

==Climate==

Tehran features a [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]], [[Continentality|continental]] climate ([[Köppen climate classification]]: [[Cold steppe|BSk]]). The northern parts can reach a mediterranean climate (Csa) bordering humid continental (Dsa). Tehran's climate is largely defined by its geographic location, with the towering [[Alborz]] Mountains to its north and the central desert to the south. It can be generally described as mild in the spring and autumn, hot and dry in the summer, and cold in the winter. Because the city is large with significant differences in elevation among various districts, the [[weather]] is often cooler in the hilly north than in the flat southern part of Tehran. For instance, the {{convert|17.3|km|abbr=on}} [[Valiasr|Vali E Asr]] street runs from the Tehran's railway station than, {{convert|1117|m|abbr=on}} elevation above see level, in the south of the city to the Tajrish square, {{convert|1612|m|abbr=on}} elevation above sea level, in the north.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} However, the elevation can even rise up to {{convert|1900|m|abbr=on}} at the end of the [[Velenjak]] street in the north of Tehran.

Summer is usually hot and dry with very little rain, but [[relative humidity]] is generally low and the nights are cool. Most of the light annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] occurs from late autumn to mid-spring, but no one month is particularly wet. The hottest month is July, mean minimum temperature {{convert|26|°C}}; mean maximum temperature {{convert|36|°C}}, and the coldest is January, mean minimum temperature {{convert|−1|°C}}; mean maximum temperature {{convert|8|°C}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;IranTour&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irantour.org/Iran/Climate.html |title=Climate of Tehran |publisher=Irantour.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Tehran enjoys a more moderate climate than other parts of the country, the weather can sometimes be unpredictably harsh. The record high temperature is {{convert|43|°C|0}} and the record low is {{convert|-17|°C|0}}. On January 5 and 6, 2008, after years of relatively little snow, a [[Winter storm|wave of heavy snow and low temperatures]] covered the city in a thick layer of snow and ice, forcing the Council of Ministers to officially declare a [[state of emergency]] and closing down the capital on January 6 and 7.&lt;ref name=&quot;IRNA&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080208071157/http://www1.irna.com/fa/news/view/line-2/8610166477213215.htm/ Heavy Snowfall in Tehran (in Persian)]. irna.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2005, heavy snow covered all of part of the city. Snow depth was {{convert|15|cm|0|abbr=on}} in south part of the city and {{convert|100|cm|0|abbr=on}} in the north of city. One newspaper said it had been the worst weather for 34 years. 10,000 bulldozers and 13,000 municipal workers deployed to keep the main roads open.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4250831.stm/ Heavy Snowfall in Tehran ( Feb 2005 )]. bbc.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chn&quot;&gt;[http://www.chn.ir/NSite/FullStory/News/?Id=74960&amp;Serv=0&amp;SGr=0/ Heavy Snowfall in Tehran (In Persian)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Tehran has seen an increase in relative humidity and annual precipitation since the beginning of the 21st century. This is most likely because of the afforestation projects, which also include expanding parks and lakes. The northern parts of Tehran are still more lush than the southern parts.

Tehran's climate can be described to have some monsoon influences; the summers&lt;!-- and winters --&gt; are very dry, and the spring and fall are rather lush, with the main precipitation occuring at this time.

On January 21, 2012, the local weather experienced a [[Extreme weather|turbulence]] unanticipated by weather forecasts. That day, the temperate fell to {{convert|-17|C}} and [[Cold wave|remained for 3 days]] at {{convert|-10|C}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;AccuWeather&quot;&gt;[http://www.accuweather.com/en/ir/tehran/210841/month/210841?monyr=1/01/2012/ January 2012 Tehran weather forecast].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ferdowsi Square (Tehran).jpg|thumb|left|[[Ferdowsi|Ferdowsi square]]]]
Tehran saw a drastic change in its ethno-social composition in the early 1980s. After the political, social and economic consequences of the [[Islamic Revolution of Iran]] in 1979 and the years that followed, some Iranian citizens, mostly Tehranis, left Iran due to mounting political, social and,religious pressure. Many Iranians moved to countries such as [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[France]], [[Sweden]] and other European countries. The highest Iranian emigration has been to the [[Iranian American|United States]], [[Iranians in France|France]] and [[Iranian Canadian|Canada]].

With the start of the [[Iran–Iraq War]] (1980–1988) following an Iraqi invasion, a second wave of inhabitants fled the city, especially during Iraqi air offensive on the capital. With most major powers backing Iraq at that time, economic isolation caused even more reasons for the inhabitants to leave the city (and the country). Having left all they had and having struggled to adapt to a new country and build a life, most of them never came back when the war was over. During the war, Tehran also received a great number of migrants from the west and the southwest of the country bordering Iraq.
[[File:TehranIranSkyline.jpg|thumb|Tehran's skyline in night]]
The unstable situation and the war in neighboring [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]] prompted a rush of refugees into the country who came in millions, with Tehran being a magnet for modest workers who helped the city to recover from war wounds, charging far less than local construction workers. Many of these refugees are being repatriated with the assistance of [[UNHCR]] but there are still sizable groups of Afghan and Iraqi refugees in Tehran who are reluctant to leave, being pessimistic about the situation in their respective country of origin. Afghan refugees are mostly Persian-speaking [[Hazara people|Hazara]] or [[Tājik people|Tajiks]], speaking a dialect of Persian, and Iraqi refugees, who are mainly [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslim]] [[Mesopotamian Arabic]]-speakers of Iranian origin.

The majority of Tehranis are followers of [[Twelvers|Twelver Shia Islam]], which is also the state religion. Religious minorities include followers of various sects of [[Sunni Islam]], [[Sufism|Mystic Islam]], [[Yârsânism]], [[Yârsânism| ]][[Zoroastrianism|Zo]][[Zoroastrianism|roastrianism]], [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] (including the adherents of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], Iranian Protestant churches like [[Jama'at-e Rabbani]] (Assemblies of God), [[Armenian Evangelical Church]], [[Armenian Brotherhood Church]], [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and the [[Presbyterian Church]]) and some from the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. Tehran also has small number of third generation Iranian [[Sikh]] community that has a [[gurudwara]] visited by Indian Prime Minister in 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indian Prime Minister in Tehran&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Lakshman|first=Nikhil|title=Indian Prime Minister in Tehran|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/slide-show/slide-show-1-how-to-organise-a-summit-the-iranian-way/20120830.htm|work=Rediff.com|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capital relocation==
{{See also|List of earthquakes in Iran}}
Plan to move the capital has been discussed many times in prior years. In 2010, the [[government of Iran]] announced that &quot;for security and administrative reasons&quot; the plan to move the capital from Tehran has been finalized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Relocation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/10/may/1322.html |title=For Security and Admnistrative [sic] Reasons: Plan to Move Capital From Tehran Finalized |publisher=Payvand.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Majlis]] named [[Shahroud]], [[Esfahan]] and [[Semnan (city)|Semnan]] as three of main candidates to replace Tehran as the capital. There are plans to relocate 163 state firms to the [[Provinces of Iran|provinces]] and several [[List of Iranian Universities|universities]] from Tehran to avoid damages from a potential [[earthquake]]. [[President Ahmadinejad]] suggested that 5 million residents should migrate out of Tehran.&lt;ref name=&quot;Relocation&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/10/jul/1064.html |title=Iran Moots Shifting Capital from Tehran |publisher=Payvand.com |date=2006-11-22 |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a starting point, Iranian authorities are relocating all defense-related industries out of the capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=137793&amp;sectionid=351020101 |title=No Operation |publisher=Presstv.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shopping====
Tehran has a wide range of shopping opportunities, from traditional bazaars to shopping districts and modern shopping malls. The great Bazaar of Tehran and the Tajrish bazaar are the biggest traditional bazaars in Tehran. Shopping districts such as Valiasr, Shariati, Mirdamad have shopping with a wide range of different shops. Big malls like Tirajeh, Golestan, Hyperstar and smaller shopping centers like Tandis, Golestan and Safavieh are popular among Tehran’s population and visitors. 
Most of the international brands and upper class shops are located in the northern and western part of the city, and the rest of the shops are distributed in all the areas of the city.
Tehran’s retail business is growing with new malls and shopping centers being built. The biggest malls under construction are the Tehran Mega Mall, Kourosh Mall and Tehran Mall and smaller “luxurious” shopping centers like Zafaranieh or Farmanieh shopping center.

==Food and restaurants==
{{See also|Cuisine of Iran}}
Tehran has many modern and chic restaurants, serving both traditional Iranian and cosmopolitan cuisine. The most popular dish of the city is the [[chelow kabab]] (kabob/kebab is originally a Persian word meaning grilled or roasted meat). However, Western-style [[fast food]] is becoming popular, especially within the younger generation. Pizza, sandwich and kebab shops make up the majority of other food outlets in the city.

==Economy==
[[File:Markazi bank Tehran.jpg|thumb|left|[[Central Bank of Iran]] building]]
{{See also|Economy of Iran|Industry of Iran|Communications in Iran}}
Tehran is the economic centre of Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/585619/Tehran/276311/Economy |title=Tehran (Iran) : People – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 30% of Iran's public-sector workforce and 45% of large industrial firms are located in Tehran and almost half of these workers work for the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/081006_iran_nuclear.pdf|author=Anthony H. Cordesman |title=The US, Israel, the Arab States and a Nuclear Iran. Part One: Iranian Nuclear Programs|format=PDF |date= September 23, 2008|work=Center for Strategic and International Studies|accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the remainder of workers are factory workers, shopkeepers, laborers, and transport workers. Few foreign companies operate in Tehran because of the Iranian government's relations to the west. But before the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic revolution]] many foreign companies were active in this region. Today many modern industries of this city include the manufacturing of automobiles, electronics and electrical equipment, weaponry, textiles, sugar, cement, and chemical products. It is also a leading center for the sale of carpets and furniture. There is an oil refinery near [[Ray, Iran|Ray]], south of the city. Tehran has four airports : [[Mehrabad International Airport]], [[Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport]], [[Ghal#ad Morghi airfield]] ([[Velayat Park]]) and [[Doshan Tappeh Air Base]].

Tehran relies heavily on private cars, buses, motorcycles, and taxis, and is one of the most car-dependent cities in the world. The [[Tehran Stock Exchange]], which is a full member of the [[World Federation of Exchanges|Federation Internationale des Bourses de Valeurs]] (FIBV) and a founding member of the [[Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchanges]], has been one of the world's best performing stock exchanges in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3129995.stm |title=Iran blocks share price gains |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-08-06 |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
{{See also|Transport in Iran|Tehran Monorail}}

===Cars===
{{see also|Automotive industry in Iran}}
According to the head of Tehran Municipality's Environment and Sustainable Development Office, Tehran has a capacity for 700,000 cars but currently more than 3 million cars are on the roads in the capital.The automation industry has recently developed but international sanctions influence the production processes periodically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/10/oct/1194.html |title='Tehran's overpopulation will cause ecological ruin' |publisher=Payvand.com |date=2006-11-22 |accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airport===
{{See also|Airlines of Iran}}
Tehran is served by two main airports. [[Mehrabad Airport]], an old airport which doubles as a military base, is used for domestic and charter flights. This airport is located in the Western part of the city. [[Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport]] located {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=off}} south of the city, handles all scheduled international flights.

===Metro===
{{See also|Tehran Metro}}
Tehran claims to have one of the cleanest and most convenient metro systems, in terms of accessibility to different parts of the city, in the region.{{Citation needed|date = August 2009}} The feasibility study and conceptual planning of the construction were started in 1970s. In 2001, the first two of the eight projected metro lines were opened. Tehran Metro has four operative lines and is {{convert|130|km|0|abbr=on}} long with another two lines under construction.

===Train===
{{See also|Iranian Railways}}
Tehran also has a [[Tehran Railway Station|central railway station]] with connecting services round the clock to various cities in the country. A Tehran-[[Europe]] train line is also running.

===Bus===
{{see also|Trolleybuses in Tehran}}
Tehran's transport system includes conventional buses, [[trolleybus]]es and [[Bus Rapid Transit]] (BRT). Buses have served the city since the 1920s. There are four bus terminals that also provide connections at low rates.{{Clarify|date = July 2009}} The terminals are located on the ''South'', ''East'', ''West'', and ''Bei-haghi Park-Drive''.

The [[trolleybus]] system opened in 1992, using a fleet of 65 [[articulated bus|articulated]] trolleybuses built by [[Škoda Works|Skoda]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot;&gt;Murray, Alan (2000). ''World Trolleybus Encyclopaedia'', pp. 57 and 99. Yateley, Hampshire, UK: Trolleybooks. ISBN 0-904235-18-1.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first trolleybus system in Iran and remains the country's only such system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot;/&gt; In 2005, trolleybuses were operating on five routes, all starting at Meydan-e-Emam-Hoseyn ([[Imam Hossein Square]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;tm265&quot;&gt;''Trolleybus Magazine'' No. 265 (January–February 2006), pp. 16–17. National Trolleybus Association (UK). {{issn|0266-7452}}.&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Imam Hossein Metro Station|Imam Hossein station]] of the [[Tehran Metro]] Line 2.  Two routes running northeastwards operate almost entirely in a segregated [[Bus Rapid Transit|busway]] located in the middle of the wide [[carriageway]] (along [[Damavand Street|Damavand Khiyaban]]), stopping only at purpose-built stops located about every 500 metres, effectively making these routes trolleybus-[[Bus Rapid Transit|BRT]] (but they are not called such).  The other three trolleybus routes run south from Meydan-e-Emam-Hoseyn and operate in mixed-traffic.  Both route sections are served both by [[limited-stop]] services and local (making all stops) services.&lt;ref name=&quot;tm265&quot;/&gt; A 3.2-km extension from Meydan-e-Shush to Meydan-e-Rah Ahan and the railway station there opened in March 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;tm298&quot;&gt;''Trolleybus Magazine'' No. 298 (July–August 2011), pp. 89–90. National Trolleybus Association (UK).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tehran Bus Rapid Transit]] (BRT) was officially inaugurated in 2008 by Tehran's mayor, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf. BRT has three lines with 60 stations in different areas of the city. As at 2011, BRT had a network of {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}}, transporting 1.8 million passengers on a daily basis. The city has also developed a [[bike share system]] which includes 12 stations in one of Tehran's districts.&lt;ref name=Turq5&gt;[http://www.turquoisepartners.com/iraninvestment/IIM-Feb11.pdf Turquoise Partners: Iran Investment Monthly (February 2011)] Retrieved April 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Highways and streets===

The metropolis of Tehran enjoys a huge network of highways (280&amp;nbsp;km) and of interchanges, ramps, and loops (180&amp;nbsp;km). In 2007 there were {{convert|130|km|0|abbr=on}} of highways and {{convert|120|km|0|abbr=on}} of ramps and loops under construction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lycos.cs.cmu.edu/info/tehran.html Tehran]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}.

While the center of the city houses the government ministries and headquarters, the commercial centers are more located toward [[Valiasr Street|Valiasr Avenue]] (formerly known as Pahlavi Avenue), [[Taleghani Ave]], and [[Beheshti Ave]] further north. Although administratively separate, [[Ray, Iran|Rey]], [[Shemiran]], and [[Karaj]] are often considered part of the larger Tehran metropolitan area.

A number of streets in Tehran are names after international personalities:
*[[Henri Corbin]] Street – downtown Tehran
*[[Edward Granville Browne|Edward Browne]] Street – near the [[Tehran University|University of Tehran]]
*[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]] Street – northern Tehran
*[[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] Expressway – western Tehran

==Air pollution==
{{See also|Environmental issues in Iran|Automotive industry in Iran}}
[[File:Tehran Pollution.jpg|thumb|Tehran's [[air pollution]]]]
[[File:Tochal sport complex 5.jpg|thumb|Tehran's [[air pollution]] view from top of [[Tochal]] mountains in 3965 M.]]

Tehran suffers from severe [[air pollution]] and the city is often covered by [[smog]] making breathing difficult and causing widespread pulmonary illnesses. It is estimated that about 27 people die each day from pollution-related diseases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/story/2006/09/060909_mv-pollution-tehran.shtml Har Ruz 27 Tehrāni be Dalile Āludegiye Hawā mimirand]. September 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; According to local officials, 3,600 people died in a single month due to the hazardous air quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6245463.stm Iran smog 'kills 3,600 in month']. [[BBC News Online]]. January 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 80% of the city's pollution is due to cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/09/jan/1007.html |title=Car exhaust fumes blamed for over 80% of air pollution in Tehran |publisher=Payvand.com |date=2006-11-22 |accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining 20% is due to [[industrial pollution]]. Other estimates suggest that motorcycles alone account for 30% of air and 50% of [[Noise pollution|sound pollution]] in Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/10/oct/1239.html |title=Motorcycles Account for 30% of Air Pollution in Tehran |publisher=Payvand.com |date=2006-11-22 |accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Iran [[2007 Gas Rationing Plan in Iran|imposed fuel rations]] but the plan has met little success in reducing the pollution levels. In 2011, with the improvements in the public transport system and the rise in fuel prices due to the new [[Iranian targeted subsidy plan|subsidies reform plan]], the Government is hoping to be able to improve the problems of pollution and traffic.&lt;ref name=Turq5/&gt;

The air pollution is due to several different reasons:
*Economical: most Iranian industries are located on the outskirts of Tehran. The city is also overrun with old and aging cars which do not meet today's emission regulations. Furthermore, Iran's busiest airport, [[Mehrabad International Airport]], is located in the west of the city;
*Most people are then obliged to either use private cars or hire taxis. This has created severe [[traffic congestion]];
*Geographical: Tehran is bound in the north by the massive [[Alborz]] mountain range that is stopping the flow of the humid Caspian wind. As a result, [[thermal inversion]] that traps Tehran's polluted air is frequently observed. The lack of humidity and clouds makes Tehran a very sunny city. The UV radiations then combined with the existing pollutants significantly raise the level of the [[ozone]]. In fact one of the urban landmarks in central Tehran is a giant air quality gauge.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Huffington Post]], &quot;Tehran Air Pollution Keeps Iran's Capital Shut Down Amid 'Unbreathable' Smog&quot;, 12 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the reportedly poor quality of Iranian-manufactured gasoline may also be contributing to the pollution.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Economist]]'', &quot;The smoggiest of all capitals&quot;, 1 January 2011, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tehran from Qeytariyeh.jpg|thumb|left|Tehran's view from [[Gheytarieh]]]]
However, the [[Government of Iran|government]], is engaged in a battle to reduce air pollution. It has, for instance, encouraged taxis and buses to convert from petrol engines to engines that run on [[compressed natural gas]]. Furthermore, since 1979 the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has set up a &quot;Traffic Zone&quot; (Tarhe Trāfik) covering the city center during peak traffic hours. Entering and driving inside this zone is only allowed with a special permit.
[[File:Northern-Tehran.JPG|thumb|Tehran and the [[Alborz]] Mountains seen on a day of relatively clean air]]
The government is also trying to raise people's awareness about the hazards of the pollution. One method that is currently being employed is the installation of Pollution Indicator Boards all around the city to monitor the current level of [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] (PM10), [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[carbon monoxide]] (CO). The board also displays the [[Pollutant Standards Index]] (PSI), which is a general indication of air quality based on the measurements of the above-mentioned five pollutants. The Pollution Indicator Boards classify the level of each pollutant as either safe, hazardous or dangerous.

==Education and research==

[[File:Darolfonun.jpg|thumb|[[Dar ul-Funun]] is one of the 
first modern institutions in the world, established by [[Amir Kabir]]]]Tehran is the largest and most important educational center of Iran. Today there are a total of nearly 50 major colleges and universities in [[Greater Tehran]].

Since the establishment of [[Darolfonoon]] in the mid-19th century, Tehran has amassed a large number of institutions of higher education. Some of these institutions have played crucial roles in the unfolding of Iranian political events. [[Samuel M. Jordan]], whom Jordan Avenue in Tehran was named after, was also one of the founding pioneers of the [[Alborz High School|American College of Tehran]].
Among major educational institutions located in Tehran, [[Tehran University|University of Tehran]], [[Tehran University of Medical Sciences]], [[Sharif University of Technology]] are the most prestigious universities of Iran. [[Tehran University|University of Tehran]] is also the oldest university in Iran and one of the oldest in [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[South Asia]].

[[File:UTEH gates.jpg|thumb|left|[[University of Tehran]]]]
[[Allameh Tabatabaei University]], [[Amirkabir University of Technology]] ([[Tehran Polytechnic]]), [[Shahid Beheshti University]] ([[Melli University]]), [[K.N.Toosi University of Technology]], [[Iran University of Science and Technology]], [[Iran University of Medical Sciences]], [[Islamic Azad University]], [[Iran Polymer and Petrochemical Institute]], [[Shahed University]] and [[Tarbiat Modarres University]] are other highly ranked universities of Iran located in Tehran.

Tehran is also home to Iran's largest military academy, and several religious schools and seminaries. Notable high schools in the city include 1. NODET (National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents ) which has two parts one for girls : [[Farzanegan School]],and one for boys: [[Allameh Helli High Schools]],2. [[Alavi High School]], 3. [[Nikan High School]], 4. [[Allameh Tabatabaei High School]] 5.[[Aboureihan High School]] and [[kherad high school]].

Tehran was the first city in the [[Middle East]] to host the [[Asian Games]]. The [[1974 Asian Games|7th Asian Summer Games in 1974]], was held with the participation of 2,363 athletes and officials from 25 countries.

Tehran is also the site of Iran's national football stadium on [[Azadi sports complex|Azadi Sport Complex]] with 100,000 [[seating capacity]]. Azadi Football Stadium is one of the largest in [[Southern Asia|Southern]] and [[Central Asia]] and one of the biggest in the World. Many of the top matches of Iran's Premier League are held here. In 2005, [[FIFA]] ordered Iran to limit spectators allowed into Azadi stadium because of a fatal crush and inadequate safety procedures. Other stadiums in Tehran are [[Shahid Dastgerdi Stadium]], [[Takhti Stadium (Tehran)|Takhti Stadium]], and Shahid Shirudi Stadium, among others.

[[File:Azadistadium tehran iran.jpg|thumb|left|[[Azadi Stadium]] is [[List of association football stadia by capacity|the 3rd]] biggest football stadium in the world and the 2nd largest in [[South Asia]].]]
The ski resort of [[Dizin]] is situated to the north of Tehran in the [[Alborz Mountains]]. [[Tochal Complex|Tochal Ski Resort]] is the world's fifth highest ski resort, at over 3,730 metres (12,240&amp;nbsp;ft) at its highest ''7th station''. The resort was completed in 1976 shortly before the overthrowing of the Shah.

Here, one must first ride the eight kilometre (five mile) long gondola lift which covers a huge vertical and is probably the longest line in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20081121200006/http://www.tochal.org/en/telecabin_introduction.asp   Lines of Telecabin]. tochal.org&lt;/ref&gt; The 7th station has three slopes. The resort's longest slope is the south side U shaped slope which goes from the 7th station to 5th station. The other two slopes are located on the north side of the 7th station. Here, there are two parallel chair ski lifts that go up to 3,900 metres (12,795&amp;nbsp;ft) near Tochal's peak (at 4,000&amp;nbsp;m/13,125&amp;nbsp;ft), rising higher than the gondola 7th station. This altitude is higher than any of the European resorts.

From the Tochal peak, one has a spectacular view of the Alborz range, including the {{convert|5610|m|ft|0}} high [[Mount Damavand]], a dormant volcano.

At the bottom of the lifts in a valley behind the Tochal peak is [[Touchal Complex|Tochal Hotel]], located at 3,500&amp;nbsp;metres (11,483&amp;nbsp;ft) altitude. From there a T lift takes skiers up the 3,800 metres (12,500&amp;nbsp;ft) of Shahneshin peak, where the third slope of Tochal is.

Tochal 7th station has skiing eight months of the year. But there are also some glaciers and year-round snow fields near Tehran where skiing began in 1938, thanks to the efforts of two German railway engineers. Today, 12 [[List of ski areas and resorts in Iran|ski resorts operate in Iran]], but the most famous are [[Tochal Complex|Tochal]], [[Dizin]], and [[Shemshak (ski resort)|Shemshak]], all within one to three hours of Tehran.

[[File:Tehran-Milad Tower2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Milad Tower]]]]
Tehran is a relatively old city; as such, it has an architectural tradition unique to itself. Archaeological investigations and excavations in Tehran demonstrate that this area was home to civilizations as far back as 6,000 years BC in the village of Ray which is now incorporated into the city.  Tehran served only as a village to a relatively small population for most of its history, but began to take a more considerable role in Iran after it was made the capital in the late 18th century.  Despite the occurrence of earthquakes during the [[Qajar Dynasty|Qajar]] period and before, some buildings still remain from Tehran's era of antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/articles/article/Iran/Tehran-Capital-City-of-Iran/128 Tehran Capital City of Iran]. ''Tehran''&lt;/ref&gt;  Today Tehran is Iran's [[primate city]], and has the most modernized infastructure in the country; however, the [[gentrification]] of old neighborhoods and the demolition of buildings of cultural significance has caused concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Urschel |first=Donna |url=http://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0408/iran.html |title=The Style of Tehran – Library of Congress |publisher=Loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Azadi Tower]] has been the longstanding symbol of Tehran. It was constructed to commemorate the [[2,500 year celebration of Iran's monarchy|2,500th anniversary of the Persian empire]], and was originally named &quot;Shahyad Tower&quot;; after the [[Iranian revolution]], its name changed to &quot;Azadi Tower,&quot; meaning &quot;Freedom Tower.&quot; The recently constructed [[Milad Tower]] may eventually replace the Azadi Tower as Tehran's new symbol. The Milad complex contains the world's [[list of towers|sixth tallest tower]], several restaurants, a five star hotel, a convention center, a world trade center, and an IT park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miladtowertehran.com/lang/index.php Milad Tower Official Website]. ''Milad Tower''&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally a low-rise city due to seismic activity in the region, modern high rise developments in Tehran have been undertaken in order to service its growing population. There have been no major quakes in Tehran since 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher=The Guardian | title= Women to blame for earthquakes, says Iran cleric | date=2010-04-19 | url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/apr/19/women-blame-earthquakes-iran-cleric }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tallest residential building in Iran is a 54-story building located North of [[Youssef Abad]] district, the [[Tehran International Tower]]. It is architecturally similar to [[Mandalay Bay]] Resort and Casino on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] in the [[Paradise, Nevada|Paradise]] community of [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]], [[Nevada]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.internationaltower.ir/ Tehran International Tower Website]. ''Tehran International Tower Website''&lt;/ref&gt; Appealing to the principle of vertical rather than horizontal expansion of the city, the Tehran International Tower is bound to the North by Youssef Abad, to the South By Hakim Highway, to the East by Kordesstan Highway and to the West by Sheikh Bahai Highway, all of which facilitate access to various parts of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;
