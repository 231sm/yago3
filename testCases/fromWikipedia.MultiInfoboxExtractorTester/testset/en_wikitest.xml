'''Campania''' ({{IPA-it|kamˈpaːnja}}) is a [[Regions of Italy|region]] in [[southern Italy]]. The region has a population of around 5.8 million people, making it the second-most-populous region of Italy; its total area of 13,590&amp;nbsp;km² makes it the most densely populated region in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://library.eb.co.uk/eb/article-9019840|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Campania|date=7 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located on the [[Italian Peninsula]], with the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] to the west, it includes the small [[Flegrean Islands]] and [[Capri]] for administration as part of the region.

Throughout much of its history Campania has been at the centre of [[Western culture|Western civilisation]]'s most significant entities. The area was colonised by [[Ancient Greeks]] and was within ''[[Magna Græcia]]'', until the [[Roman Republic]] began to dominate. During the [[Roman era]] the area was highly respected as a place of culture by the emperors, where it balanced [[Greco-Roman]] culture. The area had many [[Duchy|duchies]] and [[principalities]] during the [[Middle Ages]], in the hands of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and some [[Lombards]].

It was under the [[Normans]] that the smaller [[List of sovereign states|independent states]] were brought together as part of a sizable European kingdom, known as the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], before the mainland broke away to form the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. It was during this period that especially elements of [[Spain|Spanish]], [[France|French]] and [[Aragon]]ese culture touched Campania. Later the area became the central part of the [[Two Sicilies]] under the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], until the [[Italian unification]] of 1860 when it became part of the new state [[Italy]].

The capital city of Campania is [[Naples]]. Campania is rich in culture, especially in regards to [[gastronomy]], [[music]], [[architecture]], [[archeological]] and ancient sites such as [[Pompeii]], [[Herculaneum]] and [[Paestum]]. The name of Campania itself is derived from [[Latin]], as the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] knew the region as ''Campania felix'', which translates into English as &quot;fertile [[Rural|countryside]]&quot;. The rich natural sights of Campania make it highly important in the [[tourism]] industry, especially along the [[Amalfi Coast]], [[Mount Vesuvius]] and the island of [[Capri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lifeinitaly.com/tourism/campania/|publisher=LifeInItaly.com|title=Campania: Gateway to Southern Italy|date=7 October 2007|accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Campania has an area of 13,595&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;km and a coastline of 350&amp;nbsp;km on the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]. Campania is famous for its gulfs (Naples, Salerno and Policastro) as well as for three islands ([[Capri]], [[Ischia]] and [[Procida]]). 

Four other regions border Campania; [[Lazio]] to the northwest, [[Molise]] to the north, [[Apulia]] (Puglia) to the northeast and [[Basilicata]] to the east. 

The mountainous interior is fragmented into several [[massif]]s, rarely reaching 2,000 metres ([[Miltetto]] of 2,050&amp;nbsp;m), whereas close to the coast there are volcanic massifs: [[Vesuvio]] (1,277&amp;nbsp;m) and [[Campi Flegrei]].

The climate is typically [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] along the coast, whereas in the inner zones it is more continental, with low temperatures in winter. 51% of the total area is hilly, 34% mountainous and the remaining 15% is made up of plains. There is a high 'seismic' risk in the area of the region.

==History==
===Ancient tribes and Samnite Wars===
{{See also|Samnite Wars|Magna Græcia}}
[[File:Temple of Hera (c).jpg|thumb|Temple of Hera, [[Paestum]], built 550 BC]]
The original inhabitants of Campania were three defined groups of the [[Ancient peoples of Italy]], who all spoke the [[Oscan language]] which is part of the [[Italic languages|Italic family]]; their names were the [[Osci]], the [[Aurunci]] and the [[Ausones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.instoria.it/home/italia_antiqua_XV.htm|publisher=InStoria.it|title=Italia Antiqua - XV, Campania|date=7 October 2007|accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 8th century BC, people from [[Euboea]] in [[Greece]] known as [[Cumae]]ans began to establish [[colony|colonies]] in the area roughly around the modern day [[province of Naples]].&lt;ref name=&quot;campaniahistoryone&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iterteam.it/eng/campania/storia.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050505081832/http://www.iterteam.it/eng/campania/storia.html|archivedate=2005-05-05|publisher=Interteam.it|title=Campania: History|date=7 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Oscan tribe, the [[Samnium|Samnites]], had moved from [[central Italy]] down into Campania.  Since the Samnites were more warlike than the civilised Campanians, they easily took over the cities of [[Capua]] and Cumae, in the area which was one of the most prosperous and fertile in the [[Italian Peninsula]] at the time.&lt;ref name = &quot;samnite wars&quot;/&gt; During the [[340s BC]], the Samnites were engaging in warfare with the [[Roman Republic]] in a dispute known as the [[Samnite Wars]], with the Romans securing rich pastures of northern Campania during the [[Samnite Wars|First Samnite War]].&lt;ref name = &quot;pirat&quot;/&gt;

The major remaining independent Greek settlement was [[Naples|Neapolis]], and when the town was eventually [[Capture of Neapolis|captured by the Samnites]], the Neapolitans were in need of help.  However, [[Philip II of Macedon]] (father of [[Alexander the Great]]), the major Greek leader of the time, was busy fighting further east, so the Neapolitans could not look to the Greeks for assistance.&lt;ref name = &quot;samnite wars&quot;/&gt; This left them with no other option than to call on the [[Roman Republic|Romans]], with whom they established an alliance, setting off the [[Second Samnite War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;samnite wars&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unrv.com/empire/samnite-wars.php|publisher=UNRV.com|title=The Samnite Wars|date=7 October 2007|accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Consul|Roman consul]] Quintus Publilius Filo recaptured Neapolis by [[326 BC]] and allowed it to remain a Greek city with some autonomy as a ''[[civitas]] foederata'' while strongly aligned with Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;romannaples&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/Roman_Naples.html|publisher=Faculty.ed.umuc.du|title=Roman Naples|date=7 October 2007|accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Second Samnite War ended with the Romans controlling southern Campania and additional regions further to the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;pirat&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pirate.shu.edu/~vigorimi/genealogy/first_millenium_BC.html|publisher=Michael Vigorita|title=Ancient Times - 1st millennium B.C.|date=7 October 2007|accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman period===
{{See also|Roman Republic|Roman Empire|Italia (Roman Empire)}}
Campania was a full-fledged part of the [[Roman Republic]] by the end of the 4th century BC. It was highly valued for its useful [[pastures]] and rich countryside. Its [[Greek language]] and customs made it a centre of [[Hellenistic civilization]], creating the first traces of [[Greco-Roman]] culture.&lt;ref name = &quot;rome&quot;/&gt; [[Roman Empire|The Romans]] had established power on the entire Italian Peninsula. However, the [[Pyrrhic War]] and the rebellion of the major [[Magna Græcia]] cities under [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] in the south brought unrest. A [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|battle]] took place in Campania at [[Maleventum]] in which the Romans, led by consul [[Curius Dentatus]], were victorious. They renamed the city Beneventum (modern day [[Benevento]]), which grew in stature until it was second only to Capua in southern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =Oakley | first = Stephen P| title =A Commentary on Livy, Books VI-X| publisher =Oxford University Press | url =http://books.google.com/books?id=JqsqlajAPCoC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=in+verrem+cicero+verres| isbn =0199271437  | accessdate =2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Second Punic War]] in [[216 BC]], Capua saw an opportunity to levy for more power. The city demanded complete equality of power with the Romans. When that demand was rejected, Capua allied with [[Carthage]] against Rome.&lt;ref name = &quot;emps&quot;/&gt; The rebellious Capuans were isolated from the rest of Campania, which remained loyal allies of Rome. [[Naples]], for example, forced [[Hannibal]] to flee without ever having set foot in the city due to the imposing walls.&lt;ref name = &quot;rome&quot;/&gt; Capua was eventually starved into submission in the [[Battle of Capua (211 BC)|Roman retaking of 211 BC]], and the Romans were victorious in the overall wars.&lt;ref name=&quot;emps&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://roman-empire.info/roman-empire/13/|publisher=Roman-Empire.info|title=Second Punic War: Second Period, From The Revolt Of Capua To The Battle Of The Metaurus - b.C. 215-207|date=8 January 2008|accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Karl Briullov, The Last Day of Pompeii (1827–1833).jpg|left|thumb|''The Last Day of Pompeii'' – [[Karl Briullov]]]]
The rest of Campania, with the exception of Naples, adopted the [[Latin language]] as official and was [[Romanised]].&lt;ref name = &quot;littlehist&quot;/&gt; As part of the [[Roman Empire]], it was a comfortable period for Campania who, with [[Latium]], formed the most important region of the [[Augustus|Augustan]] divisions of [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italia]]; Campania was one of the main areas for [[grainery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;littlehist&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.emmeti.it/Cucina/Campania/Storia/Campania.ART.95.uk.html|publisher=Emmeti.it|title=Campania: A Little History|date=8 January 2008|accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The powerful [[Roman Emperor]]s chose Campania as an ideal holiday destination, amongst them [[Claudius]] and [[Tiberius]], the latter of whom is infamously linked to the island of [[Capri]].&lt;ref name = &quot;rome&quot;/&gt; It was also during this period that [[Christianity]] came to Campania. Two of the [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles]], [[Saint Peter|St. Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]], are said to have preached in the city of Naples, and there were also several [[martyr]]s during this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;catholi&quot;&gt;{{ws|&quot;[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Naples|Naples]]&quot; in the 1913 ''Catholic Encyclopedia''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the period of relative calm was violently interrupted by the epic eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]] in 79 which buried the cities of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/P/pompeii/index.htm|publisher=Channel4.com|title=Secrets of the Dead: Pompeii and Herculaneum|date=8 January 2008|accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Decline of the Roman Empire]], its last emperor, [[Romulus Augustus]], was put in a [[manor house]] prison near [[Castel dell'Ovo]], Naples, in 467, ushering in the beginning of the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] and a period of uncertainty in regards to the future of the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;rome&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://naples.rome-in-italy.com/history_naples_1.html|publisher=Naples.Rome-in-Italy.com|title=Antic Naples|date=8 January 2008|accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1281, with the advent of the [[Sicilian Vespers]], the kingdom split in half.

==Economy==
The agro-food industry is one of the main pillars of industry of Campania. The organisation of the sector is improving and leading to higher levels of quality and salaries. Campania mainly produces fruit and vegetables, but has also expanded its production of flowers grown in greenhouses, becoming one of the leading regions of the sector in Italy. The [[value added]] of this sector represents around 6.5% of the total value added of the region, equalling €213.7 million. Campania produces, furthermore, over 50% of Italy's nuts and is also the leader in the production of tomatoes, which reaches 1.5 million tonnes a year. A weak point however for the region's agriculture is the very reduced size of farms, equal to 3.53 hectares. [[Selective breeding|Animal breeding]] is widespread (it was done in 70,278 farms in 2000) and the milk produced is used to process typical products such as [[mozzarella]]. [[Olive|Olive trees]] cover over 74,604 hectares of the agricultural land and contribute by €620.6 million to the value added of agriculture, together with the production of fruit. Wine production has increased, together with the quality of the wine.&lt;ref name=&quot;regportraits2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itf3_eco.htm |title=Eurostat |publisher=Circa.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The region has a dense network of road and motorways, a system of maritime connections and an airport ([[Naples Airport]]), which connect it rapidly to the rest of the Country. Campania has a series of historical problems and internal contrasts, although they are improving. The regional capital, Naples, one of the most populated and interesting cities in Italy, rich in history and natural beauty, both artistic and archaeological, still represents the centre of regional life. The port connects the region with the whole [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean basin]], and brings tourists, as well as to the [[archaeological site]]s, to the cities of art (Naples and Caserta), to the beautiful coastal areas and to the islands. The services sector makes up for 78% of the region's gross domestic product.&lt;ref name=&quot;regportraits2&quot;/&gt;

The region, with a population of over 5.9 million inhabitants, is divided in five provinces: Naples, Benevento, Avellino, Caserta and Salerno. Over half of the population is resident in the province of Naples, where there is a population density of 2,626 inhabitants per km2. Within the province, the highest density can be found along the coast, where it reaches 13,000 inhabitants per km2 in the city of Portici, one of the most densely populated cities on the planet. The region, which was characterised until recently by an acute contrast between internal and coastal areas also under the economic aspect, in the last decade has shown an improvement thanks to the development of the provinces of Benevento and Avellino. At the same time, the provinces of Naples, Caserta and in part Salerno, have developed a variety of activities connected to advanced types of services.&lt;ref name=&quot;regportraits1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itf3_geo.htm |title=Eurostat |publisher=Circa.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike central and [[northern Italy]], in the last decade the region of Campania has not attracted large numbers of immigrants. The Italian national institute of statistics [[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]] estimated in January 2007 that 98,052 foreign-born immigrants live in Campania, equal to only 1.7% of the total regional population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.demo.istat.it/strasa2007/index.html |title=Statistiche demografiche ISTAT |publisher=Demo.istat.it |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the reason for this is in recent times, there have been more employment opportunities in northern regions than in the [[Southern Italy|Southern Italian]] regions.

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Campania}}
The [[Politics of Campania]], takes place in a framework of a [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy]], whereby the President of Regional Government is the [[head of government]], and of a pluriform [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the Regional Government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the Regional Council.

The Regional Council of Campania (''Consiglio Regionale della Campania'') is composed of 60 members, of which 47 are elected in provincial constituencies with [[proportional representation]], 12 from the so-called &quot;regional list&quot; of the elected President and the last one is for the candidate for President who comes second, who usually becomes the leader of the opposition in the Council. If a coalition wins more than 55% of the vote, only 6 candidates from the &quot;regional list&quot; will be elected and the number of those elected in provincial constituencies will be 53.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.consiglio.regione.lombardia.it/c/portal/layout?p_l_id=PRI.1046.1&amp;p_p_id=20&amp;p_p_action=1&amp;p_p_state=exclusive&amp;p_p_col_id=null&amp;p_p_col_pos=2&amp;p_p_col_count=3&amp;_20_struts_action=%2Fdocument_library%2Fget_file&amp;_20_folderId=69&amp;_20_name=l+cost+199_PDF.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pasta Puttanesca by koishikawagirl.jpg|thumb|left|[[Spaghetti alla puttanesca]], a spicy pasta dish made topped with a sauce made of tomatoes, olives, anchovies and capers, and which is a dish originally from Campania.]]
The cuisine of Campania is reflective of the many regional cuisines of Italy.  Campania's dishes have evolved and matured much like the people that live there.  The [[pizza]] in its modern aspect and taste was conceived in Naples.  Historical and original pizzas from Naples are [[pizza fritta]] (fried pizza); [[Calzone]] (literally &quot;trouser leg&quot;), which is pizza fritta stuffed with [[ricotta]] cheese; [[pizza Marinara]] (pizza seamans' style), with just [[olive oil]], [[tomato sauce]] and garlic; and [[pizza Margherita]], with olive oil, tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese and [[basil]] leaves. [[Spaghetti]] is also a well-known dish from southern Italy and Campania.  Neapolitans were among the first Europeans to use [[tomatoes]] not only as [[ornamental plant]], but also as food and garnish.

[[File:Eq it-na pizza-margherita sep2005 sml.jpg|thumb|right|An authentic Neapolitan pizza]]

Campania produces wines and is likewise known for its cheeses, including [[Lacryma Christi]], [[Fiano (cheese)|Fiano]], [[Aglianico]], [[Greco di Tufo]], [[Pere 'e palomma]], [[Ischitano]], [[Taburno]], [[Solopaca]], and [[Taurasi]].  The cheeses of Campania consist of [[Buffalo mozzarella|Mozzarella di Bufala (buffalo mozzarella)]] (mozzarella made from buffalo milk), fiordilatte (&quot;flower of milk&quot;) a mozzarella made from cow's [[milk]], [[ricotta]] from [[sheep]] or [[domestic buffalo|buffalo]] milk, [[provolone]] from cow milk, and [[caciotta]] made from goat milk. [[Domestic buffalo|Buffalo]] are bred in [[Salerno]] and [[Caserta]].

Several different cakes and pies are made in Campania. [[Pastiera]] pie is made during [[Easter]]. [[Casatiello]] and [[tortano]] are Easter bread-cakes made by adding lard or oil and various types of cheese to bread dough and garnishing it with slices of [[salami]]. [[Rum baba|Babà]] cake is a well known Neapolitan delicacy, best served with [[Rum]] or [[limoncello]] (a liqueur invented in the [[Sorrentine Peninsula|Sorrento peninsula]]).  It is an old [[Austria]]n cake which arrived in Campania during Austrian domination of the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and was modified there to became a &quot;walking cake&quot; for citizens always in a hurry for work and other pursuits.  [[Sfogliatella]] is another cake from the [[Amalfi Coast]], which is beginning to be known worldwide, as is [[Zeppole]], which is traditionally eaten on [[Saint Joseph]]'s day.  [[Struffoli]], little balls [[fried dough]] dipped in [[honey]], are enjoyed during the Christmas holidays.

[[File:Amalfi - limoni e peperoncini - &quot;lemons and red dried pepppers&quot;.jpg|thumb|left|Dried red peppers and lemons hanging from a shop in Amalfi.]]

Another well-known Campanian dish is the so-called [[Russian salad]] (which is based on similar dishes from [[France]]), made of potatoes in [[mayonnaise]] garnished with [[shrimp]] and vegetables in vinegar.  Russians call this same dish [[Olivier Salad]], and Germans call it [[Italian salad]]. Another French-derived dish is &quot;gattò&quot; or &quot;gateau di patate&quot; (oven-baked pie made of boiled potatoes).  As with the [[Russian salad]], Campania is home to other seafood-based dishes, such as &quot;[[insalata di mare]]&quot; ([[seafood salad]]), &quot;zuppa di polpo&quot; (octopus soup), and &quot;zuppa di cozze&quot; (mussel soup), are popular.  Other regional seafood dishes include &quot;frittelle di mare&quot; (fritters with seaweed), made with edible [[poseidonia]] algae, &quot;triglie al cartoccio&quot; (red mullet in the bag), and &quot;alici marinate&quot; (fresh anchovies in olive oil).  The island of Ischia is famous for its fish dishes, as well as for cooked rabbit. Campania is home to the beautiful and tasty lemons of [[Sorrento]], which were much loved by German writer Johann Wolfgang von [[Goethe]]: &quot;Kennst du das Land, wo die Zitronen blühn?&quot; (&quot;Do you know the land where the lemon-trees bloom?), Goethe, ''Mignon''. [[Rapini]] (or Broccoli rabe), known locally as friarielli, is often used in Campanian cooking.  Campania also produces many nuts, especially in the area of Salerno and Benevento. Campanian cuisine varies within the region.  While Neapolitan dishes center around seafood, Casertan and Aversana rely more on fresh vegetables and cheeses.  The cuisine from Sorrento combines the culinary traditions from both Naples and Salerno.

===Ancient, medieval, and early arts===
{{cleanup|section|2007-05-28|date=October 2007}}

[[File:Reggia Caserta parco 03-09-08 f01.jpg|thumb|The grand gardens of the baroque [[Palace of Caserta]]]]

The region of Campania is rich with a vast array of culture and history. From the [[Colonies in antiquity|Greek colony]] of [[Velia (town)|Elea]], now [[Velia]], in Campania came the philosophers of the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy]] school, [[Parmenides]] and [[Zeno of Elea]], who came to prominence around 490-480 BC. Zeno was famous for his [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]] and called by [[Aristotle]] the inventor of the [[dialectic]]. The [[Latin]] poet [[Virgilius]] (70 BC–19 BC) loved Campania so much that he decided to settle in Naples. Many parts of his [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] and immortal masterpiece [[Aeneid]] are located in Campania. Ancient scientist Plinius [[Pliny the elder]] who wrote a &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; (&quot;Pliny's History of the Nature&quot;) studied the Mount Vesuvius and was poisoned and killed by gas emitted from the volcano during the famous eruption in 79 AD. His nephew [[Pliny the younger]] described the eruption and the death of his uncle in a famous letter to one of his friends.

In Naples in 476 AD, [[Romulus Augustus]], the last emperor of the [[Western Roman Empire]], died as a prisoner of the German general [[Odoacer]]. In the [[Middle Ages]], the artist [[Giotto]] made some frescoes in [[Castel Nuovo]]. These works of art were subsequently destroyed by an earthquake.

By the end of the Middle Ages, the [[medical school]] of [[Salerno]], which combined ancient Roman and [[Medicine in ancient Greece|Greek medicine]] with Arab medicine, was known throughout Europe and its methods were adopted across the continent. Some have suggested that this may have been one of the first universities in Europe. [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]], the Tuscan poet, visited Naples on various occasions, and in the [[The Decameron|Decameron]] described it as a dissolute city. He also wrote a love story involving a noble woman close to the King of Naples.

[[File:PulcinellaGuitar.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Pulcinella]] with a guitar]]

In 1570, the famous writer [[Cervantes]], who wrote the [[romance novel]] &quot;[[Don Quixote]]&quot;, served as a Spanish soldier for a period in Naples and said that it was the most beautiful city he had ever visited. Poet [[Torquato Tasso]] author of the epic poem la &quot;[[Jerusalem Delivered|Gerusalemme Liberata]]&quot; was born in Sorrento in 1575. Years earlier in 1558, The first modern description and studies of the &quot;camera obscura&quot; (&quot;[[dark chamber]]&quot;), are firmly established in Italy with the availability of [[Giovanni Battista della Porta]] in its masterpiece [[Magiae Naturalis]], (&quot;[[Natural Magic]]&quot;). These studies then led to the first photo cameras in 1850 circa by French scientists [[Niepce]] and [[Daguerre]].

Philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]] was born in [[Nola]]. He was the first to theorize infinite suns and infinite worlds in the universe. He was burnt in [[Rome]] by [[Spanish Inquisition]] in 1600. Later, in 1606 ca. the famous painter [[Caravaggio]] established his studio in Naples. Famous Italian architect [[Cosimo Fanzago]] from [[Bergamo]] decided to live his life in Naples.

In the 18th century Naples was the last city to be visited by philosophers who created the &quot;Grand Tour&quot; which was the big touring voyage to visit all the important cultural sites of the European continent. Italian architect [[Luigi Vanvitelli]] son of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] architect  [[Kaspar van Wittel]] build the Kingdom Palace in [[Caserta]] in 1750 circa. He contributed to the construction of many [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassic-style]] palaces in which the nobles of Naples spent their holidays. These palaces are now known worldwide as &quot;[[Ville Vesuviane]]&quot;.

[[File:Overlooking Capri harbour from the rotunda in Villa San Michele hires.jpg|thumb|The island of Capri, often seen as a cultural symbol of Campania.]]

[[Raimondo di Sangro]], prince of Sansevero, was a scientist and one of the last alchemists.

'''Carlo Azeglio Ciampi''' ({{IPA-it|ˈkarlo adˈdzɛʎʎo ˈtʃampi|-|Carlo Azeglio Ciampi it.ogg}}; born 9 December 1920) is an Italian politician and banker. He was the [[List of Prime Ministers of Italy|49th]] [[Prime Minister of Italy]] from 1993 to 1994 and was the [[List of Presidents of the Italian Republic|tenth]] [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]] from 1999 to 2006. He is currently a [[Senator for life]] in the [[Italian Senate]].

==Biography==
===Education===
Ciampi was born in [[Livorno]] ([[Province of Livorno]]).&lt;ref name=Sen&gt;[http://www.senato.it/leg/15/BGT/Schede/Attsen/00000594.htm Page at Senate website] {{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving a doctorate in literature in 1941 from the [[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa]], one of the country's most prestigious universities, he was called to military duty in [[Albania under Italy|Albania]] as a lieutenant. On 8 September 1943, on the date of the [[Armistice with Italy|armistice with the Allies]], he refused to remain in the Fascist [[Italian Social Republic]], and took refuge in [[Abruzzo]], in [[Scanno, Italy|Scanno]]. He subsequently managed to pass the lines and reach [[Bari]], where he joined the [[Partito d'Azione]] (and thus the [[Italian resistance movement]]).

In 1946 he married Franca Pila. That same year, he obtained a doctorate in law from the [[University of Pisa]] and began working at the [[Banca d'Italia]]. He also joined the [[CGIL]] (Trade Union), which he left in 1980.

Oxford University awarded him an honorary [[Doctor of Civil Law]] degree in March 2005.

===Career in the Banca d'Italia===
In 1960, he was called to work in the central administration of the [[Banca d'Italia]], where he became Secretary General in 1973, Vice Director General in 1976, and Director General in 1978. In October 1979, he was nominated Governor of the Banca d'Italia and President of the Ufficio Italiano Cambi, positions he filled until 1993.

===Prime Minister===
From April 1993 to May 1994, he was the Italian [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]] overseeing a [[technical government]]. Later, as Treasury Minister from 1996 to May 1999 in the governments of [[Romano Prodi]] and [[Massimo D'Alema]], he was credited with adopting the euro currency. He personally chose the Italian design for the 1-euro coin, whereas all others were left to a television vote among some candidates the ministry had prepared. (See also: [[Italian euro coins]])

Ciampi chose the [[Vitruvian man]] of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], on the symbolic grounds that it represented man as a measure of all things, and in particular of the coin: in this perspective, money was at the service of man, instead of its opposite. The design also fitted very well on the [[Bimetallic coins|bimetallic]] material of the coin.

==President of Italy==
Ciampi was elected with a broad majority, and was the second president ever to be elected at the first ballot (when there is a requirement of a two-thirds majority) in a joint session of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]], the [[Italian Senate]] and representatives of the Regions.

He usually refrained from intervening directly into the political debate while serving as President. However, he often addressed general issues, without mentioning their connection to the current political debate, in order to state his opinion without being too intrusive. His interventions have frequently stressed the need for all parties to respect the constitution and observe the proprieties of political debate. He was generally held in high regard by all political forces represented in the parliament. The possibility of persuading Ciampi to stand for a second term as President – the so-called ''Ciampi-bis'' – was widely discussed, despite his advancing age, but it was officially dismissed by Ciampi himself on 3 May 2006, just a few days before [[Italian presidential election, 2006|his mandate expired]]. Ciampi resigned as President before the swearing-in ceremony of his successor, [[Giorgio Napolitano]].

As President, Ciampi was not considered to be close to the positions of the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and the Catholic Church, in a sort of alternance after the devout [[Oscar Luigi Scalfaro]]. He has often praised patriotism, not always a common feeling in Italy because of its abuse by the fascist regime; Ciampi, however, seems to want to stress [[self-confidence]] rather than nationalism.

On 5 May 2005, he received the [[Charlemagne Award]] of the city of [[Aachen]]. On 15 June 2005, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the [[École Normale Supérieure]] of Paris.

On 1 May 2008, he attended Charlemagne Award of the city of [[Aachen]].

==Name==
{{See|Roman Catholic (term)}}

The term &quot;catholic&quot;, derived from the Greek word καθολικός (''katholikos''), which means &quot;universal&quot; or &quot;general&quot;, was first used to describe the Church in the early 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, ''Christianity'', p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''katholikos'' is equivalent to καθόλου (''katholou''), a contraction of the phrase καθ' ὅλου (''kath' holou'') meaning &quot;according to the whole&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/catholic |title=Definition at www.Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date=|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the full name ''Catholic Church'' roughly means &quot;universal&quot; or &quot;whole&quot; church.

The combination &quot;the Catholic Church&quot; (''he katholike ekklesia'') is found for the first time in the letter of [[Ignatius of Antioch|St Ignatius]], written about the year 110. The words run: &quot;Wheresoever the bishop shall appear, there let the people be, even as where Jesus may be, there is the universal ''[katholike]'' Church.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia-Catholic&quot;/&gt; Later, in the &quot;Catechetical Discourses&quot; of [[St. Cyril of Jerusalem]] we see the name &quot;Catholic Church&quot; to identify the church from various sects. St Cyril writes, &quot;And if ever thou art sojourning in any city, inquire not simply where the Lord's house is--for the sects of the profane also attempt to call their own dens, houses of the Lord--nor merely where the church is, but where is the Catholic Church. For this is the peculiar name of the holy body the mother of us all.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia-Catholic&quot;&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03449a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[East-West Schism]] of 1054, the churches that remained in communion with the [[See of Rome]] (the diocese of Rome and its bishop, the Pope, the primal patriarch) continued to call itself &quot;Catholic&quot;, while the Eastern churches that rejected the Pope's primal authority have generally been known as &quot;Orthodox&quot; or &quot;Eastern Orthodox&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McBrien&quot;/&gt; Following the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in the 16th century, the Church continued to use the term &quot;Catholic&quot; to distinguish itself from the various [[Protestant]] denominations that split off.&lt;ref name=&quot;McBrien&quot;&gt;McBrien, Richard (2008). ''The Church''. Harper Collins. p. xvii. Online version available [http://browseinside.harpercollins.com/index.aspx?isbn13=9780061245213 Browseinside.harpercollins.com]. Quote: &quot;[T]he use of the adjective 'Catholic' as a modifier of 'Church' became divisive only after the East-West Schism&amp;nbsp;...and the Protestant Reformation&amp;nbsp;...In the former case, the Western Church claimed for itself the title ''Catholic'' Church, while the East appropriated the name ''Orthodox'' Church. In the latter case, those in communion with the Bishop of Rome retained the adjective &quot;Catholic&quot;, while the churches that broke with the Papacy were called ''Protestant''.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The name &quot;Catholic Church&quot; is the most common designation used in official church documents (e.g., the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'').&lt;ref&gt;''Libreria Editrice Vaticana'' (2003). [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_INDEX.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church''] Retrieved on: 1 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the term which [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]] used when signing the 16 documents of the Second Vatican Council.&lt;ref&gt;The Vatican. [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/ Documents of the II Vatican Council]. Retrieved on: 4 May 2009.

The Catechism of Pope Pius X published in 1908 also used the term &quot;Roman&quot; to distinguish the Catholic Church from other Christian communities who are not in full communion with [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cin.org/users/james/ebooks/master/pius/pcreed09.htm |title=The Catechism of St Pius X, The Ninth Article of the Creed, Question 20 |publisher=Cin.org |date=|accessdate=2010-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Papacy and Roman Curia===
{{Main|Catholic Church hierarchy}}
[[File:Christ Handing the Keys to St. Peter by Pietro Perugino (crop).jpg|thumb|left|alt=Painting a haloed Jesus Christ passing keys to a kneeling man. |The Church holds that Christ instituted the papacy, upon giving the keys of Heaven to [[Saint Peter]]. Represented in a painting by [[Pietro Perugino]].]]The [[Catholic Church hierarchy|Church's hierarchy]] is headed by the [[Diocese of Rome|Bishop of Rome]], the pope, a position which makes him the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church (which is composed of the [[Latin Rite]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] in [[full communion]] with the [[episcopal see|see]] of Rome). The current office-holder is [[Pope Benedict XVI|Pope Benedict&amp;nbsp;XVI]], who was elected in a [[Papal conclave, 2005|papal conclave]] on 19&amp;nbsp;April&amp;nbsp;2005.{{#tag:ref|The [[Annuario Pontificio]], the list of popes, does not assign numbers to the positions in its listing.|group=note}}

The office of the pope is known as the ''Papacy''. His [[ecclesiastical jurisdiction]] is often called the &quot;[[Holy See]]&quot; (''Sancta Sedes'' in Latin), or the &quot;[[Apostolic See]]&quot; (meaning the see of the Apostle [[Saint Peter]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jaroslav Pelikan, [http://books.google.com/books?id=S-Qve0IqI5YC&amp;pg=PA114 ''Christian Tradition: A History of the Development of Doctrine, Volume 4: Reformation of Church and Dogma (1300-1700)''] (University of Chicago Press 1985 ISBN 9780226653778), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Feduccia (editor), ''Primary Source Readings in Catholic Church History'' (Saint Mary's Press 2005 ISBN 9780884898689), p. 85.

The pope is also [[head of state]] of [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/State_and_Government/ |title=Vatican City State - State and Government |publisher=Vaticanstate.va |date=|accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; a sovereign [[city-state]] entirely [[Enclave and exclave|enclaved]] within the city of Rome.

Following the death or resignation of a pope,{{#tag:ref|The last resignation occurred in 1415, as part of the [[Council of Constance]]'s resolution of the [[Avignon Papacy]].&lt;ref name=duffy415&gt;Duffy (1997), p. 415&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} members of the [[College of Cardinals]] who are under age 80 meet in the Sistine Chapel in Rome to elect a new pope.&lt;ref name=duffy416&gt;Duffy (1997), p. 416&lt;/ref&gt; The position of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] is a rank of honour bestowed by popes on certain ecclesiastics, such as leaders within the Roman Curia, bishops serving in major cities and distinguished theologians. Although this election, known as a [[papal conclave]], can theoretically elect any male Catholic as pope, since 1389 only fellow cardinals have been elevated to that position.&lt;ref name=duffy417and18&gt;Duffy (1997), pp. 417–8&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--This claim is disputed is being temporarily hidden--&gt;

For advice and assistance in governing, the Pope may turn to the College of Cardinals, the next highest level in the hierarchy.&lt;ref name=McDonough227&gt;McDonough (1995), p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autonomous particular churches===
{{main|Latin Church|Eastern Catholic Churches}}
The Catholic Church is made up of 23 [[Particular Church#Autonomous particular Churches or Rites|autonomous particular churches]], each of which accepts the paramountcy of the [[Bishop of Rome]] on matters of doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_orientalium-ecclesiarum_en.html |title=''Orientalium Ecclesiarum'' |work=[[Vatican Council II]] |accessdate=2011-04-30 |at=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These churches, also known by the Latin term ''[[sui iuris]]'' churches, are communities of Catholic Christians whose forms of worship reflect different historical and cultural influences rather than differences in doctrine. In general, each ''sui iuris'' church is headed by a [[patriarch]] or high ranking bishop,&lt;ref&gt;CCEO, Canon 56. [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/_P1K.HTM English Translation]&lt;/ref&gt; and has a degree of self-governance over the particulars of its internal organisation, [[liturgical rites]], [[liturgical calendar]] and other aspects of its spirituality.

The largest of these is the [[Latin Church]] which reports over 1 billion members. The Pope and Roman Curia is head of the Latin Church, which developed in [[Western world]], particularly the Italian Peninsula and Southern France before spreading throughout the world. The Latin Church considered itself to be the oldest and largest branch of [[Christianity]], a heritage of certain beliefs and customs shared by many [[Christian denominations]] that trace their originals to Protestant Reformation.

Relatively small in terms of adherents compared to the Latin Church, but important to the overall structure of the Church, are the 22 self-governing Eastern Catholic Churches with a membership of 17.3 million as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnewa.org/default.aspx?ID=125&amp;pagetypeID=1&amp;sitecode=HQ&amp;pageno=1 |author=Ronald G. Roberson |title=Eastern Catholic Churches Statistics 2010 |work=CNEWA |accessdate=2011-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eastern Catholic Churches follow the traditions and spirituality of [[Eastern Christianity]] and are composed of Eastern Christians who have always remained in full communion with the Catholic Church or who have chosen to reenter full communion in the centuries following the East-West Schism and earlier divisions. Some Eastern Catholic Churches are governed by a patriarch who is elected by the [[synod]] of the bishops of that church,&lt;ref&gt;CCEO, Canons 55-150. [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/_P1R.HTM English Translation]&lt;/ref&gt; others are headed by a major archbishop,&lt;ref&gt;CCEO, Canons 151-154&lt;/ref&gt; others are under a metropolitan,&lt;ref&gt;CCEO, Canons 155-173&lt;/ref&gt; and others consist of individual eparchies.&lt;ref&gt;CCEO, Canons 174-176&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Curia has a specific department, the [[Congregation for the Oriental Churches]], to maintain relations with them.

===Dioceses, parishes and religious orders===
Individual countries, regions, or major cities are served by local [[particular church]]es known as '''[[diocese]]s''' or '''[[eparchy|eparchies]]''', each overseen by a Catholic bishop. Each diocese is united with one of the worldwide &quot;''sui iuris''&quot; particular churches, such as the Latin Church, or one of the many Eastern Catholic Churches. As of 2008, the Catholic Church altogether comprised 2,795 dioceses.&lt;ref name=&quot;sees&quot;&gt;Vatican, ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'' 2009, p. 1172.&lt;/ref&gt; The bishops in a particular country or region are often organised into an episcopal conference,&lt;ref&gt;Annuario Pontifico per l'anno 2010 (Città di Vaticano: Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; which aids in maintaining a uniform style of worship and co-ordination of social justice programmes within the areas served by member bishops.

Dioceses are further divided into numerous individual communities called [[parish]]es, each staffed by one or more [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priests]], [[deacons]], and/or [[lay ecclesial ministers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OneFaith52&quot;&gt;Barry, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Parishes are responsible for the day to day celebration of the sacraments and pastoral care of the Catholic laity.

Ordained Catholics, as well as members of the [[laity]], may enter into [[consecrated life (Catholic Church)|consecrated life]] either on an individual basis, as a [[hermit]] or [[consecrated virgin]], or by joining an [[institute of consecrated life]] (a [[religious institute]] or a [[secular institute]]) in which to take [[Religious vows|vows]] confirming their desire to follow the three [[evangelical counsels]] of chastity, poverty and obedience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canons573-746&quot;&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1Y.HTM Canon Law 573-746] Catholic Church Canon Law.

The increase was 33.02% in Africa, but only 1.17% in Europe. It was 15.91% in Asia, 11.39% in Oceania, and 10.93% in the Americas. As a result, Catholics were 17.77% of the total population in Africa, 63.10% in the Americas, 3.05% in Asia, 39.97% in Europe, 26.21% in Oceania, and 17.40% of the world population.

Of the world's Catholics, the proportion living in Africa grew from 12.44% in 2000 to 14.84% in 2008, while those living in Europe fell from 26.81% to 24.31%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zenit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Number of Catholics on the Rise|publisher=Zenit News Agency|date=27 April 2010|url=http://www.zenit.org/rssenglish-29058|accessdate=2010-05-02}}.

Membership in the Catholic Church is attained through baptism or [[Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults|reception into the Church]] (for individuals previously baptised in non-Catholic Christian churches).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 11.]. Retrieved 2008-03-09.&lt;/ref&gt; For some years until 2009, if someone [[actus formalis defectionis ab Ecclesia catholica|formally left the Church]], that fact was noted in the register of the person's baptism.

At the end of 2007, Vatican records listed 408,024 Catholic priests in the world, 762 more than at the beginning of the year. The main growth areas have been Asia and Africa, with 21.1 per cent and 27.6 per cent growth respectively. In North and South America, numbers have remained approximately the same, while there was a 6.8 per cent decline in Europe and a 5.5 per cent decrease in Oceania from 2000 to 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;cathstats&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Vatican: Priest numbers show steady, moderate increase|publisher=Catholic News Service|date=2 March 2009|url=http://www.americancatholic.org/news/newsreport.aspx?id=759|accessdate=2008-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following seems unrelated to membership and should, I think, be deleted:

==Worship and liturgy==
{{main|Catholic liturgy}}
[[File:St. Mary's Catholic Church altar, Alexandria, VA.jpg|thumbnail|Altar in St Mary's Church in Alexandria, Virginia. The altar is at the centre of Catholic worship because it is there that the &quot;Holy Sacrifice of the Mass&quot; takes place.]]Among the 23 autonomous (''sui iuris'') churches, numerous forms of worship and liturgical traditions exist, called &quot;rites&quot;, which reflect historical and cultural diversity rather than differences in belief.&lt;ref&gt;''CCC'', 1200–1209&lt;/ref&gt; In the definition of the [[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]], &lt;!--Exact Quote from an Unofficial Translation--&gt;&quot;a rite is the liturgical, theological, spiritual and disciplinary patrimony, culture and circumstances of history of a distinct people, by which its own manner of living the faith is manifested in each Church ''sui iuris''&quot;&lt;!--end quote--&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/__PS.HTM CCEO, canon 28 §1 in an unofficial English translation.] The [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-1_lt.html official text] is &quot;''Ritus est patrimonium liturgicum, theologicum, spirituale et disciplinare cultura ac rerum adiunctis historiae populorum distinctum, quod modo fidei vivendae uniuscuiusque Ecclesiae sui iuris proprio exprimitur''.&quot; (A rite is the liturgical, theological, spiritual and disciplinary heritage, differentiated by peoples' culture and historical circumstances, that finds expression in each ''sui iuris'' Church's own way of living the faith).&lt;/ref&gt; but the term is often limited to liturgical patrimony. The most commonly used liturgy is the [[Roman Rite]], but even in the Latin Catholic Church a few other [[Latin liturgical rites|rites]] are in use, and the Eastern Catholic Churches have distinct rites.

===Celebration of the Eucharist===
In all rites the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], or [[Divine Liturgy]], is the centre of Catholic worship. The Catholic Church teaches that at each Mass the bread and wine are supernaturally [[transubstantiation|transubstantiated]] into the [[Real Presence|body and blood of Christ]] by the [[Words of Institution|words of consecration]] spoken by the priest.&lt;ref&gt;''CCC'', 1324–1331&lt;/ref&gt; The words of consecration are drawn from the three [[synoptic Gospels]] and a [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|Pauline letter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wordsinstit&quot;&gt;See {{bibleverse||Luke|22:19}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|26:27–28}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|14:22–24}}, {{bibleverse||1Corinthians|11:24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church teaches that Christ established a [[New Covenant]] with humanity through the institution of the Eucharist at the [[Last Supper]], as described in these biblical verses.

Because the Church teaches that Christ is present in the Eucharist,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kreeft326&quot;&gt;Kreeft, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; there are strict rules about who may confect and who may receive the Eucharist. The sacrament can only be celebrated by an ordained Catholic priest or bishop. Those who are conscious of being in a state of mortal sin are forbidden from receiving the sacrament until they have received absolution through the [[sacrament of Reconciliation]] (Penance).&lt;ref name=&quot;Kreeft331&quot;/&gt; Catholics are normally obliged to abstain from eating for at least an hour before receiving the sacrament.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kreeft331&quot;&gt;Kreeft, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholics are not permitted to receive the Eucharist as celebrated in Protestant churches, which in the view of the Catholic Church lack the sacrament of Holy Orders, and thus also lack a valid Eucharist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P42.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1400 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Protestants are not normally permitted to receive communion in the Catholic Church. This is because unity with the Catholic faith is seen as necessary before one can partake of the Church's sacraments. In relation to the churches of Eastern Christianity not in communion with the Holy See, the Catholic Church is less restrictive, declaring that &quot;a certain communion in sacris, and so in the Eucharist, given suitable circumstances and the approval of Church authority, is not merely possible but is encouraged.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P42.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1399 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western liturgical rites===
{{Roman Rite of Mass}}
[[File:Palm-sunday-latin-mass.jpg|thumbnail|left|'''Tridentine Mass in a chapel of the Cathedral of the Holy Cross''', Boston in April 2009. This ancient form of the '''Roman Rite''' dates back to 1570; most elements are centuries older]]
The Roman Rite is the most common rite of worship used by the Catholic Church. Its use is found worldwide, spread by missionary activity originating in European Catholic nations throughout Christian history.&lt;ref name=AFAC&gt;{{cite book|last=Stuard-will|first=Kelly|title=A Faraway Ancient Country.|year=2007|publisher=Gardners Books|location=United States|isbn=978-0-615-15801-3|pages=216|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=q469xc7mbksC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=Emissary|editor=Karitas Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Two forms of the Roman Rite are authorised at present: that of the post-1969 editions of the [[Roman Missal]] ([[Mass of Paul VI]]), which is now the ordinary form of the rite and is celebrated mostly in the vernacular, i.e., the language of the people; and that of the 1962 edition (the ''[[Tridentine Mass]]''), now an [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite|extraordinary form]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kreeft326&quot;&gt;Kreeft, pp. 326–327&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The Tridentine Mass so called because standardised by [[Pope Pius V]] after the [[Council of Trent]] in the 16th century, was the ordinary form of the Roman-Rite Mass until superseded in 1969 by the Roman Missal of Paul VI; its continued use, in the version found in the 1962 edition of the Missal, is authorized by the 2007 motu proprio ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]''.|group=note}} An outline of the major liturgical elements of Roman Rite Mass can be found in the side bar.

In the United States, &quot;Anglican Use&quot; parishes have been created. They use a variation of the Roman rite that retains some of the wording of the Anglican liturgical rites.{{#tag:ref|In 1980, Pope John Paul II issued a [[Pastoral Provision|pastoral provision]] that allows establishment of personal parishes in which members of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] (the U.S. branch of the Anglican Communion) who join the Catholic Church retain many aspects of Anglican liturgical rites as a variation of the Roman rite. Such &quot;Anglican Use&quot; parishes, numbering fewer than ten, exist only in the United States.|group=note}}  Implementation is expected of the authorisation granted in 2009 for the creation wherever appropriate of [[Anglicanorum Coetibus|ordinariates]] for groups of [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] who have been approved for entrance into the Catholic Church and who may in the future use a rite that incorporates elements of Anglican tradition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anglicanorum Coetibus&quot;&gt;Apostolic Constitution of Pope Benedict XVI: [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_ben-xvi_apc_20091104_anglicanorum-coetibus_en.html ''&quot;Anglicanorum Coetibus'': Providing for Personal Ordinariates for Anglicans Entering into Full Communion with the Catholic Church&quot;]. November 4, 2009. Retrieved 2011-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Western liturgical rites (non-Roman) include the [[Ambrosian Rite]] and the [[Mozarabic Rite]].

===Eastern liturgical rites===
[[File:Kanjirappally Bishop Mathew Arackal at Tomb of Varghese Payapilly Palakkappilly.jpg|thumb|left|An Eastern Catholic bishop of the [[Syro-Malabar|Syro-Malabar Church]] holding the Mar Thoma Cross which symbolises the heritage and identity of the [[Saint Thomas Christians]] of [[Christianity in India|India]]]]
The liturgical rites of the Eastern Catholic Churches are very similar to, and often identical with, the rites used by the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and other Eastern Christian churches which historically developed in Russia, Caucasus and the Balkans, Northeastern Africa and the Middle East, but are no longer in communion with the Bishop of Rome, the Pope. The Eastern Catholic Churches are either groups of faithful which have restored full communion with the Bishop of Rome, while preserving their identity as Eastern Christians, or groups with which full communion has never been broken.

The rites used by the Eastern Catholic Churches include the [[Byzantine rite]], in its Antiochian, Greek and Slavonic varieties, the [[Alexandrian Rite|Alexandrian]] rite, the [[West Syrian Rite|Syriac rite]], the [[Armenian rite]], the [[Maronite]] rite and the [[Chaldean rite]]. In the past some of the rites used by the Eastern Catholic Churches were subject to some degree of [[liturgical Latinisation]]. However, in recent years Eastern Catholic Churches have returned to traditional Eastern practices in accord with the [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]] decree ''[[Orientalium Ecclesiarum]]''. Each church has its own [[liturgical calendar]].

==Doctrine==
{{primary sources|section|date=January 2012}}
{{See also|Catholic theology|Catholic social teaching}}
The fundamental beliefs of the Christian religion are summarised in the [[Nicene Creed]]. For Catholics, they are detailed in the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church''.&lt;ref name=&quot;cat&quot;&gt;Marthaler, preface&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=John Paul II|first=Pope|title=Laetamur Magnopere|publisher=Vatican|year=1997|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_15081997_laetamur_en.html|accessdate=2008-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the promises of Christ in the [[Gospel]]s, the Church believes that it is continually guided by the Holy Spirit and so protected [[Infallibility of the Church|infallibly]] from falling into doctrinal error.&lt;ref name=&quot;LumenG3&quot;/&gt; The Catholic Church teaches that the Holy Spirit reveals [[God]]'s truth through [[Books of the Bible|Sacred Scripture]], [[Sacred Tradition]] and the [[Magisterium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PL.HTM |title=''CCC'', 80-81, 84-86 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sacred Scripture consists of the 73 book [[Bible#Christian canons|Catholic Bible]]. This is made up of the 46 books found in the ancient Greek version of the [[Old Testament]]—known as the [[Septuagint]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Schreck21&quot;&gt;Schreck, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;—and the 27&amp;nbsp;[[New Testament]] writings first found in the [[Codex Vaticanus|Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209]] and listed in [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]]' [[Easter letter|Thirty-Ninth Festal Letter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schreck23&quot;&gt;Schreck, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The 73-book Catholic Bible contains the [[Deuterocanonical books|Deuterocanonicals]], books not in the modern [[Hebrew Bible]] and not upheld as [[Biblical canon|canonical]] by Protestants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schreck21&quot;/&gt; The [[Development of the Christian Biblical canon|process of determining which books were to be considered part of the canon]] took many centuries and was not finally resolved in the Catholic Church until the Council of Trent. |group=note}} Sacred Tradition consists of those teachings believed by the Church to have been handed down since the time of the Apostles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schreck16&quot;&gt;Schreck, pp. 15–19&lt;/ref&gt; Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition are collectively known as the &quot;deposit of faith&quot; (''depositum fidei''). These are in turn interpreted by the Magisterium (from ''magister'', Latin for &quot;teacher&quot;), the Church's teaching authority, which is exercised by the Pope and the College of Bishops in union with the Pope, the bishop of Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schreck30&quot;&gt;Schreck, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trinity===
[[File:Albrecht_Altdorfer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Crucifixion of Christ''&lt;br&gt;by Albrecht Altdorfer, 1526]]
The Catholic Church holds that there is one eternal God, who exists as a [[perichoresis|mutual indwelling]] of three persons: [[God the Father#Christianity|God the Father]]; [[God the Son]]; and the [[Holy Spirit]], which make up the [[Trinity]].

Catholics believe that Jesus Christ is the second person of the Trinity, God the Son. In an event known as the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]], through the power of the Holy Spirit, God became united with human nature through the conception of Christ in the womb of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]. Christ therefore is both fully divine and fully human. It is taught that Christ's mission on earth included giving people his teachings and providing his example for them to follow as recorded in the four Gospels.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGrath&quot;&gt;McGrath, pp. 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church teaches that through the [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]] (suffering) of Christ and his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] as described in the Gospels, all people have an opportunity for forgiveness and freedom from sin, and so can be [[Atonement in Christianity|reconciled to God]].&lt;ref&gt;''CCC'', 608&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Resurrection of Jesus]] gained for humans a possible spiritual immortality previously denied to them because of original sin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schreck113&quot;&gt;Schreck, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; By reconciling with God and following Christ's words and deeds, an individual can enter the [[Kingdom of God]], which is the &quot;...&amp;nbsp;reign of God over people's hearts and lives&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;OneFaith26&quot;&gt;Barry, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek term &quot;Christ&quot; and the Hebrew &quot;Messiah&quot; both mean &quot;anointed one&quot;, referring to the Christian belief that Jesus' death and resurrection are the fulfillment of the Old Testament's [[Jesus and Messianic prophecy|Messianic prophecies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kreeft71&quot;&gt;Kreeft, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apostolicity===
According to the Catechism, the Catholic Church professes to be the &quot;sole Church of Christ&quot;, which is described in the Nicene Creed as the [[Four Marks of the Church|One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;''CCC'', [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P29.HTM 811].&lt;/ref&gt; The church teaches that its founder is Jesus Christ, who appointed the [[twelve Apostles]] to continue his work as the Church's earliest bishops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kreeft98&quot;&gt;Kreeft, p. 98, quote &quot;The fundamental reason for being a Catholic is the historical fact that the Catholic Church was founded by Christ, was God's invention, not man's&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;As the Father gave authority to Christ (Jn 5:22; Mt 28:18–20), Christ passed it on to his apostles (Lk 10:16), and they passed it on to the successors they appointed as bishops.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic belief holds that the Church &quot;is the continuing presence of Jesus on earth&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Schreck131&quot;&gt;Schreck, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; and that all duly consecrated bishops have a lineal [[Apostolic Succession|succession]] from the apostles.&lt;ref name=&quot;OneFaith46&quot;&gt;Barry, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the Bishop of Rome (the Pope), is considered the successor to the apostle [[Simon Peter]], from whom the Pope derives his [[papal supremacy|supremacy]] over the Church.&lt;ref&gt;''CCC'', [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a9p4.htm 880]. Accessed Aug 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Church is further described in the papal encyclical ''[[Mystici Corporis Christi]]'' as the [[Mystical Body of Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Encyclical ''[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_29061943_mystici-corporis-christi_en.html Mystici Corporis Christi]'', Vatican City, 1943. Accessed Aug 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church teaches that the fullness of the &quot;means of salvation&quot; exists only in the Catholic Church, but the Church acknowledges that the Holy Spirit can make use of Christian communities separated from itself to &quot;impel towards Catholic unity&quot; and thus bring people to salvation. It teaches that anyone who is saved is saved through the Church but that people can be saved [[baptism of desire|ex voto]] and by [[baptism of blood|pre-baptismal martyrdom]] as well as when conditions of [[invincible ignorance]] are present,&lt;ref name=&quot;LumenG3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Paul VI|first=Pope|title=Lumen Gentium chapter 2|publisher=Vatican|year=1964|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html|accessdate=2008-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; although invincible ignorance in itself is not a means of salvation.

===Sacraments===
[[File:Battesimi0113.jpg|thumb|left|A priest during a [[baptism]] in [[Italy]]]]
According to the [[Council of Trent]], Christ instituted [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|seven sacraments]] and entrusted them to the Church.&lt;ref&gt;''CCC'', 1113-1114, 1117&lt;/ref&gt; These are [[Baptism]], [[Confirmation]], the [[Eucharist]], Reconciliation ([[Penance]]), [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|Anointing of the Sick]] (formerly called Extreme Unction, one of the &quot;[[Last Rites]]&quot;), [[Holy Orders]] and [[Catholic marriage|Holy Matrimony]]. Sacraments are visible rituals that Catholics see as signs of God's presence and effective channels of God's [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] to all those who receive them with the proper disposition (''[[ex opere operato]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Kreeft, pp. 298–299&lt;/ref&gt; The Catechism of the Catholic Church categorises the sacraments into three groups, the &quot;sacraments of Christian initiation&quot;, &quot;sacraments of healing&quot; and &quot;sacraments at the service of communion and the mission of the faithful&quot;. These groups broadly reflect the stages of people's natural and spiritual lives which each sacrament is intended to serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3E.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1210-1211 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sacraments of Christian initiation====
=====Baptism=====
As viewed by the Catholic Church, Baptism is the first of three sacraments of initiation as a Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3O.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1275 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It washes away all sins, both [[original sin]] and personal actual sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3N.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1263 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It makes a person a member of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3N.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1267 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a gratuitous gift of God that requires no merit on the part of the person who is baptised, it is [[infant baptism|conferred even on children]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3O.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1282 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; who, though they have no personal sins, need it on account of original sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3K.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1250 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a new-born child is in a danger of death, anyone - be it a doctor, a nurse, or a parent - may baptise the child {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}.

=====Confirmation=====
The Catholic Church sees the sacrament of confirmation as required to complete the grace given in baptism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3P.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1285 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; When adults are baptised, confirmation is normally given immediately afterwards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P31.HTM |title=Code of Canon Law, canon 883 |publisher=Intratext.com |date=2007-05-04 |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; a practice followed even for infants in the [[Eastern Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-2_lt.html |title=Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 695 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Latin Church|West]] confirmation of children is delayed until they are old enough to understand or even until they are in their teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P33.HTM |title=Code of Canon Law, canon 891 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Western Christianity, particularly [[Catholicism]], the sacrament is called ''confirmation'', because it confirms and strengthens the grace of baptism; in the Eastern Church, it is called ''chrismation'', because the essential rite is the anointing of the person with [[chrism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The%20Seven%20Sacraments%20of%20the%20Church |title=Compendium of the CCC, 267 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; a mixture of [[olive oil]] and some perfumed substance, usually [[Oleoresin|balsam]], blessed by a bishop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/councils/florence.htm#3 |title=Council of Florence: Bull of union with the Armenians |publisher=Ewtn.com |date=|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who receive confirmation must be in a state of grace, which for those who have reached the [[age of reason (canon law)|age of reason]] means that they should first be cleansed spiritually by the sacrament of Penance; they should also have the intention of receiving the sacrament, and be prepared to show in their lives that they are Christians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3T.HTM ''CCC'', 1310] and [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3V.HTM 1319]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sacraments of healing====
=====Penance=====
[[File:Convento de San Francisco - Ciudad de México - Creyente.jpg|left|thumbnail|A Catholic believer prays in a church in [[Mexico]].]]
The sacrament of penance (also called reconciliation, forgiveness, confession and conversion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The%20Sacraments%20of%20Healing |title=''Compendium of the CCC'', 296 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;) exists for the conversion of those who, after baptism, separate themselves from Christ by sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The%20Sacraments%20of%20Healing |title=''Compendium of the CCC'', 297 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essential to this sacrament are acts both by the sinner (examination of conscience, contrition with a determination not to sin again, confession to a priest, and performance of some act to repair the damage caused by sin) and by the priest (determination of the act of reparation to be performed and [[absolution]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The%20Sacraments%20of%20Healing |title=''Compendium of the CCC'', 302-303 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serious sins ([[mortal sin]]s) must be confessed within at most a year and always before receiving Holy Communion, while confession of [[venial sin]]s also is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The%20Sacraments%20of%20Healing |title=''Compendium of the CCC'', 304-306 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The priest is bound under the severest penalties to maintain the &quot;[[seal of confession]]&quot;, absolute secrecy about any sins revealed to him in confession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The%20Sacraments%20of%20Healing |title=''Compendium of the CCC'', 309 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Anointing of the Sick=====
While chrism is used only for the three sacraments that cannot be repeated (baptism, confirmation, ordination), a different oil is used by a priest or bishop to bless a Catholic who, because of illness or old age, has begun to be in danger of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The%20Sacraments%20of%20Healing |title=''Compendium of the CCC'', 316 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sacrament, known as Anointing of the Sick, is believed to give comfort, peace, courage and, if the sick person is unable to make a confession, even forgiveness of sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#The%20Sacraments%20of%20Healing |title=''Compendium of the CCC'', 319 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is not reserved for those in proximate danger of death, it is often administered as one of the Last Rites.

====Sacraments of service====
=====Ordination=====
Holy Orders is a sacrament in three degrees or orders, episcopate (bishops), presbyterate (priests) and diaconate (deacons), which consecrates and deputes some Christians to serve the whole body by these specific titles.&lt;ref&gt;Canons 1008-1009 of the Code of Canon Law as modified by the 2009 [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/apost_letters/documents/hf_ben-xvi_apl_20091026_codex-iuris-canonici_en.html motu proprio ''[[Omnium in mentem]]'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Church has defined rules on who may be ordained into the clergy. In the Latin Rite, the priesthood and diaconate are generally restricted to celibate men.&lt;ref name=&quot;CCL1031&quot;&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3Q.HTM Canon 1031] Catholic Church Canon Law.

=====Matrimony=====
Marriage, understood as an indissoluble union between a man and a woman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P53.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1626 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; if entered into validly by any baptised man and woman, is considered a sacrament by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P53.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1625 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church does not recognise divorce as ending a valid marriage and allows state-recognized divorce only as a means of protecting children or property, without allowing remarriage following such a divorce. Apart from the requirements such as freedom of consent that it sees as applicable to all, the church has established certain specific requirements for the validity of marriages by Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P53.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1631 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to observe the Church's regulations, as well as defects applicable to all marriages, may be grounds for a church declaration of the invalidity of a marriage, a declaration usually referred to as an [[annulment (Catholic Church)|annulment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P53.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1629 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judgement after death===
The Church teaches that, immediately after death, the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] of each person will receive a [[particular judgment]] from God.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;&gt;''CCC'', 1021–22, 1051&lt;/ref&gt; This teaching also attests to another day when Christ will sit in a universal judgment of all mankind. This [[Last Judgment|final judgment]], according to Church teaching, will bring an end to human history and mark the beginning of a new and better heaven and earth ruled by God in righteousness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;&gt;''CCC'', 1038–41&lt;/ref&gt; The basis on which each person's soul is judged is detailed in the Gospel of Matthew, which lists [[Works of Mercy|works of mercy]] to be performed even to people considered &quot;the least of Christ's brothers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matthew25&quot;&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|25:35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasis is upon Christ's words that &quot;Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schreck397&quot;/&gt;

According to the Catechism, &quot;The Last Judgement will reveal even to its furthest consequences the good each person has done or failed to do during his earthly life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schreck397&quot;&gt;Schreck, p. 397&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the judgement rendered, a soul may enter one of three states of afterlife:
*[[Heaven#In Roman Catholicism|Heaven]] is a time of glorious union with God and a life of unspeakable joy that lasts forever.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;&gt;''CCC'', 1023–29, 1042–50&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Purgatory]] is a temporary condition for the purification of souls who, although saved, are not free enough from sin to enter directly into heaven.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;&gt;''CCC'', 1030–32, 1054&lt;/ref&gt; Souls in purgatory may be aided in reaching heaven by the prayers of the faithful on earth and by the [[intercession of saints]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/Library/Liturgy/zlitur215.htm |title=Saints' Prayers for Souls in Purgatory |publisher=Ewtn.com |date=|accessdate=2010-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hell in Christian beliefs#Roman Catholicism|Final Damnation]]: Finally, those who persist in living in a state of mortal sin and do not repent before death subject themselves to hell, an everlasting separation from God.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;&gt;''CCC'', 1033–37, 1057&lt;/ref&gt; The Church teaches that no one is condemned to hell without having freely decided to reject God.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;&gt;''CCC'', 1058&lt;/ref&gt; No one is [[predestination|predestined]] to hell and no one can determine whether anyone else has been condemned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;&gt;''CCC'', 1037&lt;/ref&gt; Catholicism teaches that through God's mercy a person can repent at any point before death and be saved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Luke23&quot;&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|23:39–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Catholic theologians have speculated that the souls of unbaptised infants who die in original sin are assigned to [[limbo]] although this is not an official doctrine of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=7529&amp;CFID=32422018&amp;CFTOKEN=46037657 |title=Library : The Hope of Salvation for Infants Who Die Without Being Baptized |publisher=Catholic Culture |date=19 January 2007 |accessdate=2010-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virgin Mary===
[[File:LaPurisimaInmaculadaConcepciondeRibera.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] is highly regarded in the Catholic Church, proclaiming her as [[Theotokos|Mother of God]], sinless, free from [[original sin]] and as an [[intercessor]].]]

{{see also|Mary (mother of Jesus)}}

[[Catholic devotions|Devotions]] to [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Mary]] are part of Catholic piety but are distinct from the worship of God.&lt;ref&gt;Schreck, p. 199–200&lt;/ref&gt; The Church holds Mary, as [[Perpetual virginity|Perpetual Virgin]] and [[Theotokos|Mother of God]], in special regard. [[Marian doctrines of the Catholic Church|Catholic beliefs concerning Mary]] include her [[Immaculate Conception]] without the stain of original sin and bodily [[Assumption of Mary|assumption]] into heaven at the end of her life, both of which have been [[papal infallibility|infallibly]] defined as [[dogma]], by [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1854 and [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1950 respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barry, p. 106&quot;&gt;Barry, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman Catholic Mariology|Mariology]] deals not only with her life but also her veneration in daily life, prayer and [[Roman Catholic Marian art|Marian art]], [[Roman Catholic Marian music|music]] and [[Roman Catholic Marian architecture|architecture]]. Several liturgical Marian feasts are celebrated throughout the Church Year and she is honoured with many titles such as [[Queen of Heaven]]. [[Pope Paul VI]] called her [[Mother of the Church]] because, by giving birth to Christ, she is considered to be the spiritual mother to each member of the [[Body of Christ]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barry, p. 106&quot;/&gt; Because of her influential role in the life of Jesus, prayers and devotions such as the [[Rosary]], the [[Hail Mary]], the [[Salve Regina]] and the [[Memorare]] are common Catholic practices.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, p. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church has affirmed certain [[Marian apparitions]], as at [[Our Lady of Lourdes|Lourdes]], [[Our Lady of Fátima|Fátima]], [[Our Lady of Guadalupe|Guadalupe]]&lt;ref&gt;Schreck, p. 368&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Shrine of Our Lady of Good Help]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Wisconsin on the Map to Pray With Mary |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/24/us/24mary.html?_r=1 |work=The New York Times |first=Erik |last=Eckholm |date=23 December 2010|accessdate=2011-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pilgrimages to these sites are popular Catholic devotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Baedeker |first=Rob |title=World's most-visited religious destinations |work=USA Today |date=21 December 2007 |url=http://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2007-12-21-most-visited-religious-spots-forbes_N.htm |accessdate=2008-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apostolic period===
Catholic tradition and doctrine holds that the Catholic Church was founded by Jesus Christ in the 1st century AD in [[Judaea (Roman province)|Judea]] within the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[New Testament]] records Jesus' activities and teaching, his appointment of the [[twelve Apostles]] and [[Great Commission|his instructions to them to continue his work]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kreeft98O&quot;&gt;Kreeft, p. 980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bokenkotter30&gt;Bokenkotter, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Catholic Church teaches that the coming of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles, in an event known as [[Pentecost]], signalled the beginning of the public ministry of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;OneFaith46&quot;&gt;Barry, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catholic theology|Catholic doctrine]] teaches that the contemporary Catholic Church is the continuation of this early [[Christian Church|Christian community]]. It interprets the [[Confession of Peter]] found in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] as Christ's designation of [[Peter the Apostle|Saint Peter]] the Apostle and his successors, the [[bishop of Rome|Bishops of Rome]] to be the temporal head of his Church, a doctrine known as [[apostolic succession]].&lt;ref&gt;The Catholic Church recognizes as legitimate the episcopal consecrations of a number of other churches. However, it still insists that those churches are obligated to defer to the [[Primacy of the Roman Pontiff]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NatGeographic281&quot;&gt;Hitchcock, ''Geography of Religion'' (2004), p. 281, quote: &quot;Some (Christian communities) had been founded by Peter, the disciple Jesus designated as the founder of his church.&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;Once the position was institutionalized, historians looked back and recognized Peter as the first pope of the Christian church in Rome&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman11&quot;&gt;Norman, ''The Roman Catholic Church an Illustrated History'' (2007), pp. 11, 14, quote: &quot;The Church was founded by Jesus himself in his earthly lifetime.&quot;, &quot;The apostolate was established in Rome, the world's capital when the church was inaugurated; it was there that the universality of the Christian teaching most obviously took its central directive&amp;ndash;it was the bishops of Rome who very early on began to receive requests for adjudication on disputed points from other bishops.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Temporini |first=Hildegard |coauthors=Wolfgang Haase |title=[[Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt]] Principat.: Geschichte und Kultur Roms im Spiegel der neueren Forschung |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=1982 |page=480 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=kNPV4P5h1qgC&amp;pg=PA480&amp;dq=The+church+was+founded+by+jesus |doi=2008-06-26 |isbn=3110087006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spread throughout the Roman Empire===
Conditions in the Roman Empire facilitated the spread of new ideas. The empire's well-defined network of roads and waterways allowed for easier travel, while the ''[[Pax Romana]]'' made it safe to travel from one region to another. The government had encouraged inhabitants, especially those in urban areas, to learn Greek, and the common language allowed ideas to be more easily expressed and understood.&lt;ref name=bokenkotter24&gt;Bokenkotter, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most religions in the Roman Empire, however, Christianity required its adherents to renounce all other gods, a practice adopted from Judaism (see [[Idolatry]]). The Christians' refusal to join pagan celebrations meant they were unable to participate in much of public life, which caused non-Christians&amp;ndash;including government authorities&amp;ndash;to fear that the Christians were angering the gods and thereby threatening the peace and prosperity of the Empire. The resulting persecutions were a defining feature of Christian self-understanding until Christianity was legalised in the 4th century.&lt;ref name=macculloch155and164&gt;MacCulloch, ''Christianity'', pp. 155&amp;ndash;159, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- is this entire para cited to McCullough only from 3 pages? --&gt;

In 313, the struggles of the [[Early Church]] were lessened by the [[Edict of Milan|legalisation of Christianity]] by the [[Constantine I and Christianity|Emperor Constantine I]]. In 380, Christianity became the [[state religion]] of the Roman Empire by the [[Edict of Thessalonica|decree of the Emperor]], which would persist until the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] and, later, with the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] until the [[Fall of Constantinople]]. During this time (the period of the [[Seven Ecumenical Councils]]) there were considered five primary sees according to [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]]: Rome, [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]], [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] and [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Alexandria]], known as the [[Pentarchy]].

===Middle Ages===
After the destruction of the Western Roman Empire, the [[Western Christianity]] was a major factor in the preservation of [[Classical antiquity|classical civilisation]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} establishing [[monasteries]] and sending missionaries to convert the peoples of [[northern Europe]] as far as Ireland in the north. In the [[Eastern Christianity]], the Byzantine Empire preserved [[Orthodoxy]] well after the massive invasions of [[Islam]] in the [[Christianity in the 7th century|mid-7th century]]. The invasions of Islam devastated three of the five [[Patriarchal see]]s, capturing Jerusalem first, then Alexandria, and then finally, in the [[Christianity in the 8th century|mid-8th century]], Antioch. The whole period of the next five centuries was dominated by the struggle between [[Christianity and Islam]] throughout the [[Mediterranean Basin]]. The battles of Poitiers and Toulouse preserved the Catholic tradition even though Rome itself was ravaged in 850 and Constantinople was besieged.&lt;!-- this summary isn't cited, won't tag it, but needs sources --&gt;

===Doctrine disputes and schisms===

In the [[Christianity in the 11th century|11th century]], already strained relations between the primarily Greek church and the [[Latin]] church in the developed into the [[East-West Schism|Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity]] respectively, partially due to conflicts over [[Papal authority]].

In 1854 Pope Pius IX with the support of the overwhelming majority of Roman Catholic bishops, whom he had consulted from 1851 to 1853, proclaimed the [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]] of the Immaculate Conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/alpha/data/aud19930324en.html |title=John Paul II, General Audience, March 24, 1993 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=1993-03-24 |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870, the [[First Vatican Council]] affirmed the doctrine of [[papal infallibility]] when exercised in specifically defined pronouncements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leith&quot;&gt;Leith, ''Creeds of the Churches'' (1963), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Duffy232&quot;&gt;Duffy, ''Saints and Sinners'' (1997), p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Controversy over this and other issues resulted in a breakaway movement called the [[Old Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fahlbusch&quot;&gt;Fahlbusch, ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity'' (2001), p. 729&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Second Vatican Council]] in the 1960s introduced the most significant changes to Catholic practices since the [[Council of Trent]] four centuries before. Initiated by [[Pope John XXIII]], this ecumenical council modernised the practices of the Catholic Church, allowing the Mass to be said in the [[vernacular]] (local language), and encouraging &quot;fully conscious, and active participation in liturgical celebrations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html |title=CONSTITUTION ON THE SACRED LITURGY SACROSANCTUM CONCILIUM |publisher=Vatican.va |date=1963-12-04 |accessdate=2012-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It intended to engage the Church more closely with the present world (''[[aggiornamento]]''), which was described by its advocates as an &quot;opening of the windows&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duffy272&quot;&gt;Duffy, pp. 270–276&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to changes in the liturgy, it led to changes to the Church's approach to [[Catholic Church and ecumenism|ecumenism]],&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, ''Saints and Sinners'' (1997), p. 272, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; and a call to improved relations with non-Christian religions, especially [[Judaism]], in its document ''[[Nostra Aetate]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOSTRA AETATE&quot;&gt;Pope Paul VI. [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651028_nostra-aetate_en.html ''Nostra Aetate'': Declaration on the Relation of the Church to Non-Christian Religions]. October 28, 1965. Retrieved 2011-06-16. According to Section 4: &quot;True, the Jewish authorities and those who followed their lead pressed for the death of Christ; still, what happened in His passion cannot be charged against all the Jews, without distinction, then alive, nor against the Jews of today. Although the Church is the new people of God, the Jews should not be presented as rejected or accursed by God, as if this followed from the Holy Scriptures.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council, however, generated significant controversy in implementing its reforms; proponents of the &quot;[[Spirit of Vatican II]]&quot; such as [[Switzerland|Swiss]] theologian [[Hans Küng]] claimed Vatican II had &quot;not gone far enough&quot; to change church policies.&lt;ref&gt;Bauckham, p. 373&lt;/ref&gt; [[Traditionalist Catholics]], such as [[Archbishop]] [[Marcel Lefebvre]], however, strongly criticised the council, arguing that the council's liturgical reforms led &quot;to the destruction of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and the sacraments,&quot; among other issues.&lt;ref&gt;O’Neel, Brian.

San Diego: Catholic Answers, April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New evangelisation===
[[Pope John Paul II]] recognised the need to evangelise an increasingly secular world and used new means to reach the faithful. He instituted [[World Youth Day]], a &quot;worldwide encounter with the Pope&quot;, for young people from all over the world which is celebrated every two to three years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madrid11.com/en/what-is-wyd]&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled more than any other pope, visiting 129 countries and preaching the Gospel in nearly every part of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell-Stuart, P.G. (2006). Chronicle of the Popes: Trying to Come Full Circle. London: Thames &amp; Hudson. p. 234. ISBN 978-0-500-28608-6.&lt;/ref&gt; He also used television and radio as means of spreading the Gospel.

===Social justice issues===
{{main|Catholic social teaching}}
In 1978, [[Pope John Paul II]], formerly archbishop of [[Kraków]] in then-[[Communism|Communist]] [[Poland]], became the first non-Italian Pope in 455 years. His 27-year [[pontificate]] was one of the longest in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.co.uk/this-day-in-history/April-02.html;jsessionid=08931E713115A304B13BB1A6FA315A63.public1 |title=2&amp;nbsp;April - This Day in History |publisher=History.co.uk |date=|accessdate=2010-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], the last premier of the [[Soviet Union]], credited the Polish pope with hastening the fall of Communism in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Peter and Margaret Hebblethwaite, and Peter Stanford |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/apr/02/guardianobituaries.catholicism |title=Obituary: Pope John Paul II &amp;#124; World news &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=2 April 2005|accessdate=2010-10-28 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic nun [[Mother Teresa]] of Calcutta was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1979 for her humanitarian work among India's poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1979/press.html |title=Press Release - The Nobel Peace Prize 1979 |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=27 October 1979 |accessdate=2010-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop [[Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo]] won the same award in 1996 for &quot;work towards a just and peaceful solution to the conflict in [[East Timor]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1996/press.html |title=Press Release - Nobel Peace Prize 1996 |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=11 October 1996 |accessdate=2010-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexuality and gender issues===
{{see also|Catholic teachings on sexual morality|Catholic ordination of women}}
Soon after the close of the Second Vatican Council, Church teachings about sexuality became an issue of increasing controversy due to changing cultural attitudes in the [[Western world]] (see the [[Sexual Revolution]]). In his encyclical ''[[Humanae Vitae]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;humanae&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Paul VI|first=Pope|title=Humanae Vitae|publisher=Vatican|year=1968|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html|accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1968), Pope [[Paul VI]] rejected all artificial contraception (though he permitted the regulation of births by means of [[natural family planning]]), contradicting those voices in the Church that saw at the time the [[birth control pill]] as an ethically justifiable method of contraception. This teaching was continued especially by [[John Paul II]] in his encyclical ''[[Evangelium Vitae]]'', where he decried [[contraception]] and [[Catholic Church and abortion|abortion]] as well as [[euthanasia]] as symptoms of a &quot;culture of death&quot; and called for a &quot;culture of life&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bokenkotter493&quot;&gt;Bokenkotter, p. 27, p. 154, pp. 493–494&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts in support of the [[Catholic ordination of women|ordination of women]] led to several rulings by the Roman Curia or Popes against the proposal, as in ''[[Declaration on the Question of the Admission of Women to the Ministerial Priesthood]]'' (1976), ''[[Mulieris Dignitatem]]'' (1988) and ''[[Ordinatio Sacerdotalis]]'' (1994). According to the latest ruling, found in ''Ordinatio Sacerdotalis'', Pope John Paul II concluded, &quot;I declare that the Church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the Church's faithful.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_22051994_ordinatio-sacerdotalis_en.html ''Apostolic Letter ''Ordinatio Sacerdotalis'' of John Paul II to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on Reserving Priestly Ordination to Men Alone''] Copyright ©1994 Libreria Editrice Vaticana. Retrieved 2011-06-05&lt;/ref&gt; In defiance of these rulings, opposition groups such as [[Roman Catholic Womenpriests]] have performed alleged ordination ceremonies (with, reputedly, an ordaining male Catholic bishop in the first few instances) which, according to [[canon law]], are both illicit and invalid and considered mere ''simulations''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P54.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1379]&lt;/ref&gt; of the sacrament of Ordination.&lt;ref name=&quot;RCWP&quot;&gt;[http://www.romancatholicwomenpriests.org/ordained.htm &quot;Ordinations: Response Regarding Excommunication Decree&quot;]. © 2011 Roman Catholic Womenpriests-USA, Inc.

===Sex abuse cases===
In the 1990s and 2000s, the issue of [[Catholic sex abuse cases|sexual abuse of minors by Catholic clergy]] became the subject of media coverage and public debate in the United States, Ireland, Australia and [[Roman Catholic sex abuse cases by country|other countries]]. The Church was criticized for its handling of abuse complaints when it became known that some bishops had shielded accused priests, transferring them to other pastoral assignments where some continued to commit sexual offenses. In response to the scandal, the Church has established formal procedures to prevent abuse, encourage reporting of any abuse that occurs and to handle such reports promptly, although groups representing victims have disputed their effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=David Willey |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-10645748 |title=Vatican 'speeds up' abuse cases |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=15 July 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011, a submission was lodged with the [[International Criminal Court]] alleging that the Pope, Cardinal [[Angelo Sodano]] dean of the [[College of Cardinals]], Cardinal [[Tarcisio Bertone]] [[Vatican Secretary of State]] and Cardinal [[William Levada]] head of the [[Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith]], had committed a [[crime against humanity]] by failing to prevent or punish perpetrators of rape and sexual violence in a &quot;systematic and widespread&quot; concealment which included failure to co-operate with relevant law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Karen McVeigh. 'Pope Accused of Crimes Against Humanity by Victims of Sex Case' The Guardian. Tues 13 Sept 2011 http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/sep/13/pope-crimes-humanity-victims-abuse (accessed 14 Sept 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement to the Associated Press, the Vatican described this as a &quot;ludicrous publicity stunt and a misuse of international judicial processes.&quot; Lawyers and law professors emphasized that the case likely falls outside the court's jurisdiction. Additionally, forcing the Vatican to submit to the ICC could prove impossible to the court. David Chandler, professor of international relations at the University of Westminster in London, saw in the action &quot;more of an ethical statement before the international community than a real attempt at a court case&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2011/0915/Why-the-ICC-likely-won-t-charge-pope-over-Catholic-Church-sex-abuses |title=Why the ICC likely won't charge pope over Catholic Church sex abuses |publisher=The Christian Science Monitor |date=September 15, 2011 |accessdate=February 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''entrepreneur''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-entrepreneur.ogg|ˌ|ɒ|n|t|r|ə|p|r|ə|ˈ|n|ɜː}}) is an owner or manager of a business enterprise who makes money through risk and initiative.&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/entrepreneur&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{Cite book

The term was originally a [[loanword]] from [[French language|French]] and was first defined by the Irish-French [[economist]] [[Richard Cantillon]]. Entrepreneur in [[English language|English]] is a term applied to a person who is willing to help launch a new venture or enterprise and accept full responsibility for the outcome. [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], a French economist, is believed to have coined the word &quot;entrepreneur&quot; in the 19th century - he defined an entrepreneur as &quot;one who undertakes an enterprise, especially a contractor, acting as intermediatory between capital and labour&quot;.&lt;ref group=note&gt;''Guide to Management Ideas and Gurus'', Tim Hindle, The Economist, page 77,&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Profession==
Entrepreneurs become what they are for several reasons. Many, depending on the person, choose to do so to avoid workplace drama, [[discrimination]], being taken advantage of, or just to be their own boss.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/220439]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership attributes==
The entrepreneur leads the firm or organization and also demonstrates leadership qualities by selecting managerial staff.  Management skill and strong team building abilities are essential leadership attributes for successful entrepreneurs. Scholar [[Robert Reich|Robert. B. Reich]] considers [[leadership]], management ability, and [[team-building]] as essential qualities of an entrepreneur.  This concept has its origins in the work of Richard Cantillon in his ''Essai sur la Nature du Commerce en'' (1755) and Jean-Baptiste Say &lt;ref group=note&gt;See William J. Baumol, Robert E. Litan &amp; Carl J. Schramm. Good capitalism, bad capitalism, and the economics of growth and prosperity 3 (2007), citing generally Peter F. Drucker. Innovation and entrepreneurship (1985) (attributing coining and defining of “entrepreneur” to Jean-Baptiste Say, a treatise on political economy (1834)); but see Robert H. Brockhaus, Sr., The Psychology of the Entrepreneur, in Encyclopedia of Entrepreneurship 40 (Calvin A. Kent, et al. eds. 1982), citing J. S. Mill, Principles of political economy with some of their applications to social philosophy (1848). Note that, despite Baumol et al.'s citation, the Drucker book was published in 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; in his ''Treatise on Political Economy.

Entrepreneurs emerge from the population on demand, and become leaders because they perceive opportunities available and are well-positioned to take advantage of them.  An entrepreneur may perceive that they are among the few to recognize or be able to solve a problem.  [[Joseph Schumpeter]] saw the entrepreneur as innovators and popularized the uses of the phrase [[creative destruction]] to describe his view of the role of entrepreneurs in changing business norms. Creative destruction encompasses changes entrepreneurial activity makes every time a new process, product or company enters the markets.

==Influences, personality traits, and characteristics==
The most significant influence on an individual's decision to become an entrepreneur is workplace peers and the social composition of the workplace.{{cn|date=December 2011}}  The ability of entrepreneurs to innovate relates to innate traits such as extroversion and a proclivity for risk-taking. According to Schumpeter (1934), the capabilities of innovating, introducing new technologies, increasing efficiency and productivity, or generating new products or services, are characteristics of entrepreneurs.  Entrepreneurs are catalysts for economic change. Research has found entrepreneurs to be highly creative with a tendency to imagine new solutions by finding opportunities for profit or reward.&lt;ref&gt;Olakitan, O. (5 November 2011). [cscanada.net/index.php/ibm/article/download/j.ibm...075/2066 An Examination of the Impact of Selected Personality Traits on the Innovative Behaviour of Entrepreneurs in Nigeria]. CSC Canada: International Business and Management, Vol. 3, No. 2, pp. 112-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a complexity and lack of cohesion between research studies that explore the characteristics and personality traits of, and influences on, the entrepreneur.  Most studies, however, agree that there are certain entrepreneurial traits and environmental influences that tend to be consistent.  Although certain entrepreneurial traits are required, entrepreneurial behaviours are dynamic and influenced by environmental factors.  Shane and Venkataraman (2000) argue the entrepreneur is solely concerned with opportunity recognition and exploitation; although, the opportunity that is recognised depends on the type of entrepreneur which Ucbasaran et al. (2001) argue there are many different types dependent on their business and personal circumstances. However, it should also be noted that there are approaches that appear highly critical against valorized conceptions of entrepreneurs. For example, there are views that attribute pertinent conceptions to scholarly prejudices, such as unrealistically voluntaristic preconceptions on how a &quot;normal&quot; economic agent ought to behave (Ramoglou, 2011; Gartner, 2001). 

Psychological studies show that the psychological propensities for male and female entrepreneurs are more similar than different.  Perceived gender differences may be due more to gender stereotyping.  There is a growing body of work that shows that entrepreneurial behavior is dependent on social and economic factors. For example, countries which have healthy and diversified labor markets or stronger safety nets show a more favorable ratio of opportunity-driven rather than necessity-driven women entrepreneurs.  Empirical studies suggest that men entrepreneurs possess strong negotiating skills and consensus-forming abilities.

==Types of entrepreneurs==
The literature has distinguished among a number of different types of entrepreneurs, for instance:

===Social entrepreneur===
A [[Social entrepreneurship|social entrepreneur]] is motivated by a desire to help, improve and transform [[social]], [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]], [[educational]] and [[economic]] conditions.  Key [[traits]] and characteristics of highly effective social entrepreneurs include [[ambition]] and a lack of acceptance of the [[status quo]] or accepting the world &quot;as it is&quot;.  The social entrepreneur is driven by an [[emotional]] desire to address some of the big social and economic conditions in the world, for example, [[poverty]] and educational deprivation, rather than by the desire for [[Profit (economics)|profit]].  Social entrepreneurs seek to develop [[innovative]] solutions to global problems that can be copied by others to enact change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode

Social entrepreneurs act within a market aiming to create social value through the improvement of goods and services offered to the community. Their main aim is to help offer a better service improving the community as a whole and are predominately run as non profit schemes. Zahra et al. (2009: 519) said that “social entrepreneurs make significant and diverse contributions to their communities and societies, adopting business models to offer creative solutions to complex and persistent social problems”.

===Serial entrepreneur===
A serial entrepreneur is one who continuously comes up with new ideas and starts new businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/serial-entrepreneur.html Business dictionary definition]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the media, the serial entrepreneur is represented as possessing a higher propensity for risk, innovation and achievement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doeswhat.com/2011/06/02/25-intriguing-startup-quotes/ Serial Entrepreneur Quotes]&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Lifestyle entrepreneur===
A lifestyle entrepreneur places passion before [[Profit (economics)|profit]] when launching a business in order to combine personal interests and talent with the ability to earn a living. Many [[entrepreneurs]] may be primarily motivated by the intention to make their business profitable in order to sell to [[shareholders]].{{Examples|date=June 2011}}  In contrast, a lifestyle entrepreneur intentionally chooses a [[business model]] intended to develop and grow their business in order to make a long-term, sustainable and viable living working in a field where they have a particular interest, passion, talent, knowledge or high degree of expertise. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | url=http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/12/is-entrepreneurship-just-about-the-exit/
  | accessdate = 12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A lifestyle entrepreneur may decide to become [[self-employed]] in order to achieve greater personal freedom, more family time and more time working on projects or business goals that inspire them.  A lifestyle entrepreneur may combine a hobby with a profession or they may specifically decide not to expand their business in order to remain in control of their venture.  Common goals held by the lifestyle entrepreneur include earning a living doing something that they love, earning a living in a way that facilitates self-employment, achieving a good [[work/life balance]] and owning a business without shareholders.{{Elucidate|date=June 2011}} Many lifestyle entrepreneurs are very dedicated to their business and may work within the [[creative industries]] or [[tourism industry]],&lt;ref&gt;Peters, M, Frehse, J, Buhalis, D, The importance of lifestyle entrepreneurship: A conceptual study of the tourism industry, PASOS Vol. 7, No. 2 p393-405, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; where a passion before profit approach to [[entrepreneurship]] often prevails.  While many entrepreneurs may launch their business with a clear [[exit strategy]], a lifestyle entrepreneur may deliberately and consciously choose to keep their venture fully within their own control.  Lifestyle [[entrepreneurship]] is becoming increasing popular as technology provides [[small business]] owners with the digital platforms needed to reach a large [[global market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Theory-based Typologies===
Recent advances in entrepreneurship research indicate that the differences in entrepreneurs and heterogenity in their behaviors and actions can be traced back to their the founder's identity. For instance, Fauchart and Gruber (2011, Academy of Management Journal) have recently shown that -based on social identity theory - three main types of entrepreneurs can be distinguished: Darwinians, Communitarians and Missionaries. These types of founders not only diverge in fundamental ways in terms of their self-views and their social motivations in entrepreneurship, but also engage fairly differently in new firm creation.

'''Forza Italia'''&lt;ref&gt;The name is not usually translated into English: ''forza'' means &quot;force&quot; or &quot;strength&quot;, while ''Italia'' is [[Italy]]. The party's name seems originates from a common expression used by sports fans during sports events such as the [[Olympic Games]], and especially by supporters of the [[Italian national football team]], meaning  &quot;Go Italy!&quot;, but it is not to forget that this was also the slogan of [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] in [[Italian general election, 1987|1987 general election]] (see Giovanni Baccarin, ''Che fine ha fatto la DC?'', Gregoriana, Padova 2000).

The party was founded in December 1993 and won its first [[Italian general election, 1994|election]] soon afterwards in March 1994. It was the main member of the [[Pole of Freedoms]] and the [[House of Freedoms]] coalitions, and is considered (by both insiders and outsiders) to have been very different from the other Italian political parties.

In November 2008 the National Council of the party, presided by [[Alfredo Biondi]], officially ruled on the dissolution of Forza Italia into [[The People of Freedom]],&lt;ref name=&quot;National Council&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/politica/08_novembre_21/forza_italia_diventa_pdl_9a0f5cb6-b7e3-11dd-8fa8-00144f02aabc.shtml |title=Forza Italia si scioglie, ora è Pdl Berlusconi: «Dal '94 nulla è cambiato» - Corriere della Sera |publisher=Corriere.it |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlusconi's new political vehicle, whose official took place in early 2009.

==History==
===Foundation (1993–1994)===
Forza Italia was formed in 1993 by [[Silvio Berlusconi]], a successful [[businessman]] and owner of four of the main private [[television station]]s in Italy, along with [[Antonio Martino]], [[Mario Valducci]], [[Antonio Tajani]], [[Marcello Dell'Utri]], [[Cesare Previti]] and [[Giuliano Urbani]].

Italy was shaken by a series of corruption scandals known as ''[[Tangentopoli]]'' and the subsequent police investigation, called ''[[Mani pulite]]''. This led to the disappearance of the five parties which governed Italy from 1947: [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|DC]], [[Italian Socialist Party|PSI]], [[Italian Democratic Socialist Party|PSDI]], [[Italian Liberal Party|PLI]] and [[Italian Republican Party|PRI]] (they formed a successful five-party coalition called ''Pentapartito'' from 1983 to 1991, and then governed without PRI from 1991 to 1994) and to the end of the so-called [[History of the Italian Republic#The First Republic (1947-1992)|First Republic]].

Forza Italia's aim was to attract moderate voters who were &quot;disoriented, political orphans and who risked being unrepresented&quot; (as Berlusconi described them), especially if the ex-[[Italian Communist Party|Communist]] [[Democratic Party of the Left]] was to win the next election and enter in government for the first time since 1947.

===A short stint in power (1994–1995)===
A few months after its creation, Forza Italia came to national power after the [[Italian general election, 1994|1994 elections]] as the head of a political [[coalition]] called [[Pole of Freedoms]], composed of [[Lega Nord]], [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]], [[Christian Democratic Centre]] and [[Union of the Centre (1994)|Union of the Centre]].

Silvio Berlusconi was sworn in in May 1994 as prime minister of Italy in a [[Berlusconi I Cabinet|government]] in which the most important cabinet posts were held by fellow FI members: Antonio Martino was foreign minister, Cesare Previti defence minister, [[Alfredo Biondi]] justice minister and [[Giulio Tremonti]] (at the time an independent member of Parliament) finance minister.

The government had a short life and fell in December, when Lega Nord left the coalition, after disagreements over pension reform and the first ''avviso di garanzia'' (preliminary notice of an investigation) for Berlusconi, passed by Milan prosecutors. Forza Italia's leader was replaced as prime minister by [[Lamberto Dini]], an independent politician who had been the administration's treasury minister. No members of Forza Italia joined the new government and the party leader was relegated to opposition.

===Five years of opposition (1996–2001)===
In 1996 the Pole of Freedoms finally lost the [[Italian general election, 1996|elections]] and began what Berlusconi called &quot;the crossing of the desert&quot;, something that could have been proven fatal for a young and unstructured party such as Forza Italia. Between 1996 and 1998, the party started to strengthen its organization, under [[Claudio Scajola]], a former [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrat]] who was national coordinator of the party from 1996 to 2001. 

In 1999 Forza Italia gained full membership of the [[European People's Party]], of which [[Antonio Tajani]], party leader in the [[European Parliament]], was Vice President. In the same year, it scored very well (25.2%) in the [[European Parliament election, 1999 (Italy)|1999 European Parliament election]]. 

In 2000 regional elections the Pole of Freedoms, with the support of Lega Nord, won in 8 regions (the most popolous ones, except [[Campania]]) out of 15 and Forza Italia's members were elected President of Region in [[Piedmont]] ([[Enzo Ghigo]], confirmed), [[Lombardy]] ([[Roberto Formigoni]], confirmed), [[Veneto]] ([[Giancarlo Galan]], confirmed), [[Liguria]] ([[Sandro Biasotti]], newly elected), [[Puglia]] ([[Raffaele Fitto]], newly elected) and [[Calabria]] ([[Giuseppe Chiaravalloti]], newly elected).

The party regained power in the [[Italian general election, 2001|2001 elections]] (29.4% along with [[Giorgio La Malfa]]'s tiny [[Italian Republican Party]]), in a new coalition called [[House of Freedoms]] and composed mainly of National Alliance, Lega Nord, Christian Democratic Centre and [[United Christian Democrats]] (the last two parties merged in 2002 forming the [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]], UDC).

===Five years in government (2001–2006)===
In June 2001, after the huge success in May elections, Sivio Berlusconi was returned head of the Italian government, the longest-serving [[Berlusconi II Cabinet|cabinet]] in Italian Republican history. Again all ministerial key-posts were given to Forza Italia members: interior ([[Claudio Scajola]] 2001–2002, [[Giuseppe Pisanu]] 2002–2006), defence ([[Antonio Martino]] 2001–2006), finance ([[Giulio Tremonti]], 2001–2004 and 2005–2006), industry ([[Antonio Marzano]] 2001–2005, Claudio Scajola 2005–2006) and foreign affairs ([[Franco Frattini]], 2002–2004). Anyway [[Gianfranco Fini]], [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]]'s leader, was appointed vice-president of the government and foreign minister from 2004 to 2006, while [[Roberto Castelli]], senior figure of [[Lega Nord]] was justice minister from 2001 to 2006.

The government's popularity kept declining steadily year after year. Regional elections in April 2005 were a serious blow for the party, which however remained strong in the northern regions, such as [[Lombardy]] and [[Veneto]], and somewhere in the South, where [[Sicily]] is a stronghold. After this disappointing electoral performance the cabinet was reshuffled, due to the insistence of the [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]]'s leaders, and Berlusconi formed his [[Berlusconi III Cabinet|third cabinet]].

During his five years in office, Berlusconi government passed a series of reforms: a pension system reform, a labour market reform, a judiciary reform and a constitutional reform – the latter rejected by a referendum in June 2006. In foreign policy he shifted the country's position to more closeness to the [[United States]], while in economic policy he was not able to deliver the tax cuts he had openly promised throughout all 2001 electoral campaign.

===Toward The People of Freedom (2006–2009)===
[[File:Logo ForzaItalia 2006.png|thumb|120px|right|2008 logo]]
In the [[Italian general election, 2006|2006 general election]] the party was present with a slightly different logo, with the words &quot;Berlusconi President&quot; (''Berlusconi Presidente''). It was the only party to use the word &quot;President&quot; in its logo. In the election for the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]], FI scored 23.7% and 137 seats, in those for the [[Italian Senate|Senate]] 24.0%, without counting [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol|Trentino-Alto Adige]], whose seats were contested on [[first-past-the-post]] basis and which is a left-wing stronghold, due to its alliance with the autonomist [[South Tyrolean People's Party]]).

On 31 July 2007 Berlusconi's protegee and possible successor [[Michela Vittoria Brambilla]] registered the name and the logo of the &quot;Freedom Party&quot; (''Partito della Libertà'') apparently with Berlusconi's backing. On 18 November, after Forza Italia claimed to have collected the signatures of more than 7 million Italians (including [[Umberto Bossi]]) against the [[Prodi II Cabinet|Romano Prodi's second government]] in order to ask the [[President of the Italian Republic|President of the Republic]] [[Giorgio Napolitano]] to call a fresh election,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansa.it/opencms/export/site/notizie/rubriche/daassociare/visualizza_new.html_65041167.html ]{{dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlusconi announced that Forza Italia would have soon merged or transformed into [[The People of Freedom]] (PdL) party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skylife.it/html/skylife/tg24/politica.html?idvideo=56053 |title=Sky tg24 - Tutte le notizie in formato video |publisher=Skylife.it |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/politica/07_novembre_18/berlusconi_partito_popolo_italiano.shtml |title=«Oggi nasce il partito del popolo italiano».

After the sudden fall of [[Prodi II Cabinet]] on 24 January 2008, the break-up of [[The Union (political coalition)|The Union]] coalition and the subsequent political crisis paving the way towards a new general election, Berlusconi hinted on 25 January that Forza Italia would have probably contested its last election and the new party would have been officially founded only after that election. In an atmosphere of reconciliation with [[Gianfranco Fini]], Berlusconi also stated that the new party could have seen the participation of other parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/politica/08_gennaio_25/berlusconi_napoli_a48218f8-cb73-11dc-9e0e-0003ba99c667.shtml |title=«Via l'Ici e stretta sulle intercettazioni» Corriere della Sera |publisher=Corriere.it |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, on 8 February, Berlusconi and Fini agreed to form a joint list under the banner of the &quot;The People of Freedom&quot;, allied with Lega Nord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/politica/200802articoli/29934girata.asp |title=Svolta di Berlusconi, arriva il Pdl: &quot;Forza Italia-An sotto stesso simbolo&quot; |publisher=Lastampa.It |date=2008-02-08 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Italian general election, 2008|2008 general election]] the PdL won 37.4% and a majority in both chambers, thanks to the alliance with Lega Nord (8.3%). Soon after the election Berlusconi formed his [[Berlusconi IV Cabinet|fourth government]].

On 21 November 2008 the National Council of the party, presided over by [[Alfredo Biondi]] and attended by Berlusconi himself, officially decided the dissolution of Forza Italia into [[The People of Freedom]], whose official foundation took place on 27 March 2009.

==Ideology==
Forza Italia was a [[centre-right]] party, formed mainly by ex-[[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]], ex-[[Italian Liberal Party|Liberals]] and ex-[[Italian Socialist Party|Socialists]]. The ideology of the party ranged from [[libertarianism]] to [[social democracy]] (often referred to as &quot;liberal socialism&quot; in Italy), including elements of the [[Catholic social teaching]] and the [[social market economy]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.forzaitalia.it/images/cdv/cartadeivalori.pdf copertina860x280.qxd]{{dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was a member of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP) and presented itself as the party of renewal and modernization. The core values of Forza Italia were &quot;[[Political freedom|freedom]]&quot; and the &quot;[[individualism|centrality of the individual]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moroni&quot;/&gt; From a comparative perspective the ideology of Forza Italia has been characterized as both &quot;liberal conservative&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;EuroPol&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;intute&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Book1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=dJujgAT1s8AC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;dq=forza+italia+conservative-liberal |title=The organization of political ... - Google Libri |publisher=Books.google.it |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04|isbn=9780275956127|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Maine&quot;&gt;[http://academic.umf.maine.edu/~erb/classes/1eu3.htm European politics]{{dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Wolfram Nordsieck |url=http://www.parties-and-elections.de/italy.html |title=Retrieved on 2-5-2008 [http://books.google.it/books?id=e3J9Wjrh1KAC&amp;pg=PA260&amp;lpg=PA260&amp;dq=Forza+Italia+liberal-conservative&amp;source=web&amp;ots=MicFSEMIuR&amp;sig=kZK_66EBuFqAnKp0-mu6AdqP_tM&amp;hl=it A fatal attraction: public ... - Google Libri |publisher=Parties-and-elections.de |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;geocities&quot;&gt;[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://es.geocities.com/sucellus23/telos27.htm&amp;date=2009-10-25+03:26:19  What is Italy's National Alliance?]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;national conservative&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mair&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

[[Alessandro Campi]] wrote that &quot;the political culture of Forza Italia – a curious and, on many respects, untold mixture of &quot;liberalism&quot; and &quot;democratic [[populism]]&quot; – deserves to be described as an &quot;anti-ideologic ideology&quot;, [...] as a synthesis or fusion of very diverse political families and traditions (from [[liberal catholicism]] to [[social conservatism]], from [[reformism|reformist socialism]] to [[economic liberalism]]), kept together by the mobilizing appeal to &quot;freedom&quot;&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moroni&quot;/&gt; [[Chiara Moroni (professor)|Chiara Moroni]], who explains Forza Italia's ideology as a mixture of [[liberalism|liberal]], [[christian democracy|christian-democratic]] and [[social democracy|social-democratic]] values (united in the concept of &quot;popular liberalism&quot; in party documents), wrote that &quot;Berlusconi offered to voters liberal values through a populist style&quot; and that &quot;Forza Italia has made the liberal political ideal popular&quot; among voters, so that &quot;it was spread and shared by broad and heterogenous sectors of the Italian population&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moroni&quot;/&gt;

In fact the electoral base of Forza Italia was highly heterogeneous and the ideological differences among its voters are explained also by its different regional constituencies: while voters from the North tended to support the original [[libertarianism|libertarian]] line of the party, voters from the South tended to be more [[statism|statist]].&lt;ref&gt;Donatella Campus, ''L'anti-politica al governo. De Gaulle, Reagan, Berlusconi'', Il Mulino, Bologna 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Both its Northern strongholds ([[Lombardy]], [[Veneto]]) and its Southern strongholds ([[Sicily]], [[Apulia]]) were once dominated by the Christian Democracy party, but, while in the South most leading members of Forza Italia are former Christian Democrats, the party was highly influenced also by liberals in the North.&lt;ref&gt;Ilvo Diamanti, ''Bianco, rosso, verde... e azzurro. Mappe e colori dell'Italia politica'', Il Mulino, Bologna 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Forza Italia claimed to be a fresh-new party, with no ties with the last governments of the so-called [[History of the Italian Republic#The First Republic (1947-1992)|First Republic]], and at the same time to be the heir of the best political traditions of Italy: [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrat]] [[Alcide De Gasperi]], [[Italian Democratic Socialist Party|Social Democrat]] [[Giuseppe Saragat]], [[Italian Liberal Party|Liberal]] [[Luigi Einaudi]] and [[Italian Republican Party|Republican]] [[Ugo La Malfa]] were considered as party icons.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The &quot;Secular Creed&quot;, that was also the preable to the party's constitution, described the party in this way: {{quote|Forza Italia is a liberal party although not an elitist one, indeed a popular liberal-democratic party; it is a Catholic party although not a confessional one; it is a secular party, although not an intolerant and secularist one; it is a national party, although not a centralist one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forzaitalia.it/images/grafica-2007/chi-siamo/credolaico.pdf credo]{{dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forzaitalia.it/speciali/statutoforzaitalia04.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - statuto intero 1.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Forza Italia thus presented itself as a bridge between Catholics and non-Catholics, who have been previously divided in the political system of the First Republic, and &quot;the union of three political-cultural areas: that of liberal and popular Catholicism, that of secular, liberal and republican humanism and that of liberal socialism&quot;.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In a speech during a party congress in 1998, Berlusconi himself proclaimed: &quot;our liberal vision of the State is perfectly in agreement with the Catholic social teaching&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Berlusconi, Silvio, ''L'Italia che ho in mente'', Mondadori, Milan 2000, pp. 122-123&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Secular Creed&quot; of the party explains that FI was a party that primarily underlined freedom and the centrality of the individual, which are basic principles of both [[liberalism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/li/liberali.html liberalism. The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001-2008&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Catholic social teaching,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/justpeace/documents/rc_pc_justpeace_doc_20060526_compendio-dott-soc_it.html |title=Compendio della Dottrina Sociale della Chiesa |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; often connected in party official documents: {{quote|We believe in freedom, in all its several and vital forms: in the freedom of thought, in the freedom of expression, in religious freedom, of every religion, in the freedom of association. [...] Freedom is not graciously conceded by the State, because it comes before it. It is a natural right, which belongs to us as we are human beings and it itself rather lays the foundations of the State. [...] We believe that the State should be at the service of citizens, and not citizens at the service of the State. We believe that the State should be the servant of the citizen and not the citizen the servant of the State. The citizen is sovereign. For this, we believe concretely in the individual [...]. We believe in the values of our Christian tradition, in the life values which cannot be renounced, in common good, in freedom of education and learning, in peace, in solidarity, in justice, in tolerance [...].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forza-italia.it/images/grafica-2007/chi-siamo/credolaico.pdf credo]{{dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2008 Berlusconi stated that:
{{quote|We want a social market economy. A democracy cannot afford citizens in poor conditions. With our book on welfare we tackle the needs of the weakest families. It is decidedly a left-wing policy. This government which centrist, liberal, with Catholics and reformists, intends to advance with policies that the left-wing promises by word of mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/politica/08_luglio_25/berlusconi_conferenza_governo_b4134d24-5a33-11dd-bcb1-00144f02aabc.shtml |title=Berlusconi, via alle tre riforme «Facciamo una politica di sinistra» - Corriere della Sera |publisher=Corriere.it |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Sandro Bondi]], a leading member of the party, wrote:
{{quote|Forza Italia considers liberal classics as [[Benedetto Croce|Croce]], [[Luigi Sturzo|Sturzo]], [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]] and [[Luigi Einaudi|Einaudi]] as reference authors. In particular, it hark back to the [[social market economy]] of [[Wilhelm Röpke|Röpke]], which was conceived in reference to the [[Catholic social teaching|traditional social teaching of the Church]]. Forza Italia has imparted a deep cultural innovation, combining the language of the Church tradition with the liberal and reformist thought.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moroni&quot;/&gt;}}

The party included also non-[[Catholic]] members, but they were a minority, and it was less secular in its policies than [[Germany|German]] [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amconmag.com/larison/2005/09/21/merkels-cdu-fared-worse-than-expected/ |title=Eunomia » Merkel’s CDU Fared Worse Than Expected |publisher=Amconmag.com |date=2005-09-21 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in which there are also prominent [[Jew]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.literaturfestival.com/bios1_3_6_582.html |title=Michael Friedman |language={{de icon}} |publisher=Literaturfestival.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The party usually gave to its members freedom of conscience on moral issues (and hence a [[conscience vote|free vote]]), as in the case of the referendum on [[stem cell|stem-cell research]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2005/maggio/15/Fecondazione_divisi_vertici_Forza_Italia_co_8_050515047.shtml |title=Fecondazione, divisi i vertici di Forza Italia |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; but leading members of the party, including [[Silvio Berlusconi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2005/giugno/15/Berlusconi_Margherita_venga_con_noi_co_8_050615023.shtml |title=Berlusconi: la Margherita venga con noi moderati |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giulio Tremonti]] and [[Marcello Pera]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2005/maggio/29/Pera_difesa_dell_astensione_scontro_co_8_050529021.shtml |title=Pera e la difesa dell' astensione, scontro tra i poli |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; (who is himself non-Catholic, although friend of Pope [[Benedict XVI]]), spoke in favour of &quot;abstention&quot; (as asked by the Catholic Church,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2005/gennaio/18/Fecondazione_Ruini_chiama_all_astensione_co_9_050118017.shtml |title=Fecondazione, Ruini chiama all' astensione |publisher=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to not surpass the 50% of turnout needed for making the referendum legally binding). While Pera campaigned hard for the success of the boycott alongside with most FI members, both Berlusconi and Tremonti explicitly said that &quot;abstention&quot; was their personal opinion, not the official one of the party.

==Members==
:''See also [[List of Forza Italia leading members by political origin]]''

Most members of the party were former [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]] (DC): [[Giuseppe Pisanu]] (former member of the leftist faction of DC and Minister of Interior), [[Roberto Formigoni]] (President of [[Lombardy]]), [[Claudio Scajola]] (former Minister of the Interior and of Industry), [[Enrico La Loggia]], [[Renato Schifani]], [[Guido Crosetto]], [[Raffaele Fitto]], [[Giuseppe Gargani]], [[Alfredo Antoniozzi]], [[Giorgio Carollo]], [[Giuseppe Castiglione (politician)|Giuseppe Castiglione]], [[Francesco Giro]], [[Luigi Grillo]], [[Maurizio Lupi]], [[Mario Mantovani]], [[Mario Mauro]], [[Osvaldo Napoli]], [[Antonio Palmieri]], [[Angelo Sanza]], [[Riccardo Ventre]] and [[Marcello Vernola]] are only some remarkable examples.

Several members were former [[Italian Socialist Party|Socialists]] (PSI), as [[Giulio Tremonti]] (Vice President of the party and former Minister of Economy), [[Franco Frattini]] (Vice President of the [[European Commission]]), [[Fabrizio Cicchitto]] (national deputy-coordinator of the party), [[Renato Brunetta]], [[Francesco Musotto]], [[Amalia Sartori]], [[Paolo Guzzanti]] and [[Margherita Boniver]]. Berlusconi himself was a close friend of [[Bettino Craxi]], leader of PSI, in spite of his Christian Democratic and Liberal background (he was a DC's activist in occasion of the [[Italian general election, 1948|1948 general election]]).

Many were former [[Italian Liberal Party|Liberals]] (PLI), [[Italian Republican Party|Republicans]] (PRI) and [[Italian Democratic Socialist Party|Social Democrats]] (PSDI): [[Alfredo Biondi]] (President of Forza Italia's National Council) and [[Raffaele Costa]], both former PLI leaders, and former PSDI leader [[Carlo Vizzini]] were later MPs for Forza Italia. Also [[Antonio Martino]] and [[Giancarlo Galan]] were formers Liberals, [[Jas Gawronski]] was a leading Republican, while [[Marcello Pera]] has a Socialist and [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical]] background.

Even some former [[Italian Communist Party|Communists]] were leading members of the party, such as national party coordinator [[Sandro Bondi]] and [[Fernando Adornato]].

==Factions==
Members of Forza Italia were divided in factions, which were sometimes mutable and formed over the most important political issues, despite previous party allegiances. However it is possible to distinguish some patterns. The party was divided basically over ethical (between [[social conservatism|social conservative]]s and progressives), economic (between social-democrats and some Christian-democrats on one side and liberals on the other one) and institutional issues. 

Regarding the latter issue, generally speaking, northern party members were staunch proposers of [[federalism|political]], [[fiscal federalism]] and [[autonomy]] for the Regions (in some parts of [[Veneto]] and [[Lombardy]], it was sometimes difficult to distinguish a member of FI from a ''[[Lega Nord|leghista]]''), while those coming from the South were more cold on the issue. Also some former [[Italian Liberal Party|Liberals]], due to their role of unifiers of Italy in the XIX Century, were more centralist.

A scheme of the internal factions within Forza Italia could be this:
*'''[[Liberalism|Liberals.]]''' Supporters of [[free-market]], [[deregulation]], economic freedoms, [[civil rights]] and, in general, personal responsibility and freedom. This group was basically formed by two wings: '''[[classical liberals]]''' (former members of the [[Italian Liberal Party]], most of them organized in [[Popular Liberalism]], as [[Alfredo Biondi]], [[Raffaele Costa]], [[Egidio Sterpa]] and [[Enrico Nan]]); former [[Italian Socialist Party|Socialists]], as [[Renato Brunetta]] and [[Paolo Guzzanti]]; others like [[Stefania Prestigiacomo]] and [[Simone Baldelli]]) and '''[[Libertarianism|liberatarians]]''', as [[Antonio Martino]] (ex-PLI), [[Dario Rivolta]], [[Benedetto Della Vedova]] (ex-[[Italian Radicals|Radical]]) and his [[Liberal Reformers]]. The latter were more staunchly pro-[[United States]] than the former and supported the idea of transforming Italy into a federal State.
*'''[[Liberalism|Liberal]]-[[centrism|centrists.]]''' They were more moderate than Martino and Della Vedova on economic issues, and more social-conservative on ethical issues, although not being totally sided with the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]. To this broad group belong people of various origin: former Socialists (as [[Giulio Tremonti]], [[Franco Frattini]], [[Giampiero Cantoni]], [[Amalia Sartori]] and [[Jole Santelli]]), former [[Italian Republican Party|Republicans]] (as [[Luigi Casero]], [[Denis Verdini]] and [[Donato Bruno]]), former Liberals (as [[Giancarlo Galan]], [[Giuseppe Vegas]] and [[Paolo Romani]]), some former liberal [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]] ([[Giuseppe Cossiga]] and [[Basilio Germanà]]) and many others (as [[Giorgio Jannone]], [[Antonio Leone]], [[Gianfranco Micciché]] and [[Aldo Brancher]]). They were strong in Northern Italy and strong supporters of political and fiscal federalism.
*'''[[Christian democracy|Christian democrats.]]''' They believed in the [[social market economy]] model and were supporters of Catholic stances over ethical issues. Most former members of [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] were identifiable with this tendency (from [[Roberto Formigoni]] to [[Giuseppe Pisanu]], from [[Claudio Scajola]] to [[Enrico La Loggia]], from [[Guido Crosetto]] to [[Angelo Sanza]], from [[Maurizio Lupi]] to [[Giuseppe Gargani]], from [[Antonio Palmieri]] to [[Mario Mantovani]]), but also ex-[[Italian Communist Party|Communists]], such as [[Sandro Bondi]] and [[Fernando Adornato]], and an ex-Socialist as [[Gianni Baget Bozzo]], a Catholic priest who is in charge of cultural formation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Moroni&quot;/&gt; fitted the category, along with former Liberals, as [[Isabella Bertolini]]. Some were more socially conservative than others (for example Formigoni and '''[[theoconservative]]s''' like [[Marcello Pera]]) and many of them were close to Giulio Tremonti, indeed this group and that described before were very close on most political issues, so that the two factions were often undistinguishable. They are probably the most [[europeanism|europeanist]] wing of the party, along with former Socialists, but many of them were also the most [[atlanticism|atlanticists]] within it, as Adornato and Pera. In 2007 Adornato, Pisanu and Formigoni launched a faction named [[Liberal-Popular Union]], but, the faction soon was disbanded as Adornato left Forza Italia to join UDC. Formigoni had also his own group, [[Network Italy]], mainly composed of Catholics active in [[Communion and Liberation]], to which group both Crosetto and Fitto showed closeness.
*'''[[Social democracy|Social democrats.]]''' The most progressive wing of the party, especially about ethical issues. They were basically former Socialists, as [[Fabrizio Cicchitto]], [[Francesco Colucci]], [[Maurizio Sacconi]], [[Margherita Boniver]], [[Giorgio Stracquadanio]], [[Chiara Moroni]] and [[Stefania Craxi]], or former [[Italian Democratic Socialist Party|Social Democrats]], as [[Carlo Vizzini]], [[Nicola Cosentino]] and [[Paolo Russo]]. They considered themselves the true heirs of [[Pietro Nenni]], [[Giuseppe Saragat]] and [[Bettino Craxi]], continued to declare themselves 'Socialists' and were sided with [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s centre-right because they saw the Italian centre-left as too much hegemonized by the [[Democrats of the Left]], heir of the [[Italian Communist Party]], which was the harshest rival of the Italian Socialists from the Fifties to the Nineties. These Forza Italia's social democrats were organized in four sub-factions: [[We Blue Reformers]], [[Free Foundation]], [[Young Italy (current)|Young Italy]] and [[Circles of Reformist Initiative]].

Christian democrats and liberal-centrists were undoubtedly the strongest factions within the party, but all four were mainstream for a special issue: for example liberals and liberal-centrists were highly influential over economic policy, Christian democrats led the party over ethical issues (although there was a substantial minority promoting a more progressive outlook), while social democrats had their say in defining the party's policy over labour market reform and, moreover, it is thanks to this group (and to those around Tremonti, he himself a former Socialist) that constitutional reform was at the top of Forza Italia's political agenda. It is difficult to say to what faction Berlusconi was closer, what is sure is that his political record was a synthesis of all the political tendencies within the party.

==Internal structure==
Before being merged into the PdL, Forza Italia had a President (currently [[Silvio Berlusconi]]), two Vice-Presidents ([[Giulio Tremonti]] and [[Roberto Formigoni]]), a Presidential Committee (presided by [[Claudio Scajola]]) and a National Council (presided by [[Alfredo Biondi]]). 

As the President is the leader of the party, a national coordinator was in charge of internal organization and day-to-day political activity, similarly to the secretary-general in many European parties. Moreover the party had thematic departments and regional, provincial or metropolitan coordination boards plus a lot of affiliate clubs (Club Azzurro) all over Italy. 

It has been claimed that Forza Italia had no internal democracy because there was no way of changing the leader of the party from below (although the party's constitution makes it possible). Key posts in the party structure were appointed by Berlusconi or by his delegates. Forza Italia's organization was based on the idea of a &quot;party of the elected people&quot;, giving more importance to the whole electorate than to party's members.

Party national-level conventions did not have normally elections to choose the party leadership (although the National Congress elected some members of the National Council), and they seemed to be more like events arranged for propaganda purposes. However, Berlusconi was highly popular among his party fellows, and it was unlikely he could be overthrown if such an election were to occur.

Within the party there was a long debate over organization. The original idea was the so-called &quot;light party&quot; (''partito leggero''), intended to be different from Italian traditional, bureaucratic and self-referential, party machines. This was the line of the early founders of the party, notably [[Marcello Dell'Utri]] and [[Antonio Martino]]. However [[Claudio Scajola]] and most former [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]] supported a more capillary-based organization, in order to make participate as much people as possible, and a more collegial, participative and democratic decision-making process.

==Distinctive traits==
Since its birth Forza Italia used unconventional means for European politics (in fact resembling more the American model), such as stickering, SMS messaging and mass mailing of propaganda material, including the biography of its leader Berlusconi, &quot;An Italian story&quot; (''Una storia italiana''). 

The party was heavily dependent on Berlusconi's image. The party's anthem was sung in karaoke fashion at American-style conventions. There was nominally no internal opposition (although some critical voices raised up, such as those of Senators Paolo Guzzanti and [[Raffaele Iannuzzi]]). The party used TV advertising extensively, although this has been slightly restricted since 2000 by a law passed by the then centre-left majority.

'''Gianfranco Fini''' (born January 3, 1952 in [[Bologna]]) is an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[politician]], President of the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies]], leader of the [[center-right]] [[Future and Freedom]] party, and the former leader of the conservative [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] and the [[Neo-fascism|post-fascist]] [[Movimento Sociale Italiano|Italian Social Movement]]. He was [[Deputy Prime Minister]] and [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] in [[Silvio Berlusconi]]’s government from 2001 to 2006.

==Biography==
===Family origins===
His grandfather, a [[communist]] activist, died in 1970. His father, Argenio &quot;Sergio&quot; Fini (Bologna 1923 - [[Rome]] 1998), was a volunteer with the [[Italian Social Republic]] (the nazi Germany [[puppet state]] in Northern Italy in 1943-45); he later declared feeling close to the [[Italian Socialist Democratic Party]], but he withdrew from political activity after his son became involved in the [[Movimento Sociale Italiano]].

His mother, Erminia Marani ([[Ferrara]] 1926 - Rome 2008), was the daughter of Antonio Marani, who took part along with [[Italo Balbo]] in the [[march on Rome]], which signaled the beginning of [[Italian fascism|fascism]] in 1922. The name Gianfranco was chosen in remembrance of a cousin, who was killed when he was 20 years old by partisans soon after the liberation of Northern Italy on April 25, 1945.

===Personal events===
In the 1980s he met Daniela Di Sotto, at that time married to Sergio Mariani, a friend and party officer. Mrs. Di Sotto ended her marriage to stay with Fini. Mariani would try to kill himself soon after. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Piccolillo|first=Virginia|title=Gianfranco e Daniela e l’ostilità dei salotti|url=http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Cronache/2007/06_Giugno/17/gianfranco_daniela_ostilita_dei_salotti.shtml|publisher=corriere.it|accessdate=27 October 2011|language=Italian|date=17 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collettivamente.com/articolo/2150360.html Interview to Mariani]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 they had their only daughter, Giuliana. Fini and Di Sotto married in a civil ceremony in [[Marino]] in 1988. They separated in 2007.

Five months after his separation, his relationship with Elisabetta Tulliani, a lawyer, was revealed. In December 2007, they had a daughter, Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.corriere.it/cronache/07_dicembre_02/figlia_fini_d4bc67c4-a0fa-11dc-a70a-0003ba99c53b.shtml |title=È nata Carolina Fini |accessdate=2 December 2007 |editor=[[Corriere della Sera]] |date=2 December 2007|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their second daughter is called Martina.

==Political life==
===From the beginning to the role of Deputy of Giorgio Almirante===
Gianfranco Fini attended &quot;Laura Bassi&quot; high school in Bologna. His first known involvement with politics occurred in 1968 when, the 16-year-old Fini was involved in clashes with communist activists, among them a protest in front of a cinema against the screening of the [[John Wayne]] movie ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]''. At this time, he became involved with the [[Movimento Sociale Italiano|Italian Social Movement]] (MSI), a neo-fascist political party.

He then began his political career in the ''Fronte della Gioventù'' (Youth Front), the MSI youth organization.

Three years later, he moved with his family to Rome. In August 1976 he served his military service in [[Savona]], then in Rome at the [[Ministry of Defence (Italy)|Ministry of Defence]]. In 1977 he became national secretary of the ''Fronte della Gioventù'', chosen by [[Giorgio Almirante]], MSI secretary, notwithstanding his fifth place among seven candidates elected in the national secretariat of the youth movement.

In the meantime, Fini had also graduated with a degree in [[pedagogy]] from [[La Sapienza]] University in Rome. He also collaborated with the party's newspaper, ''[[Il Secolo d'Italia]],'' along with the youth movement magazine ''Dissenso.''

Fini was first elected to the [[Camera dei Deputati|Chamber of Deputies]] on June 26, 1983, as a member of the MSI. Re-elected in 1987, in September he was nominated by Almirante to be his successor as the party's secretary.

In 2009 it emerged that as early as 1980 Almirante had identified Fini as one among a group of young Italians who were &quot;young, non-fascist, non-nostalgic, who believe, as I do by now, in these institutions, in this [[Constitution of Italy|Constitution]]. Because only in this way the MSI can have a future&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniele Protti|url=http://www.corriere.it/europeo/politica/2009/03/protti-intervista-almirante_e08a8364-07ed-11de-805b-00144f02aabc.shtml|title= Almirante: &quot;Non voglio morire da fascista&quot;|accessdate= 6-03-2009|editor=''[[Corriere della Sera]]''|date= 3 March 2009|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===From the Italian Social Movement to National Alliance===
[[Giorgio Almirante]] died in May 1988, and at the party's congress in [[Sorrento]] that year, Fini defeated the right wing of the party, headed by [[Pino Rauti]], and was elected party secretary. He remained in the national secretariat of the MSI until January 1990, when at the next party congress in [[Rimini]], Pino Rauti was elected secretary. But in July 1991, after a tough electoral defeat in administrative and regional elections in [[Sicily]], Fini returned to his role as party secretary. He held this post until the dissolution of party in 1995.

During his time as national secretary, he confirmed the MSI’s role as the inheritors of [[Benito Mussolini]]’s [[Italian fascism|Fascist]] legacy with a number of famous polemical statements, including: &quot;Dear comrades, [[MSI-DN|MSI]] claims its right to refer to fascism&quot; (1988), &quot;We are fascists, the heirs of fascism, the fascism of the year 2000&quot; (1991), &quot;After almost half a century, the idea of fascism is alive&quot; (1992), &quot;There are phases where [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] is not among the key values&quot; (1994), &quot;[[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] was the greatest Italian statesman of the twentieth century&quot;, &quot;Fascism has a tradition of honesty, correctness and good government&quot; (1994). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=De Cesare|first=Corrado|title=Il fascista del Duemila. Le radici del camerata Gianfranco Fini|year=1995|publisher=Kaos edizioni|isbn=8879530461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the autumn of 1993, Fini ran for mayor of Rome, garnering enough votes to participate in a runoff election that resulted in the victory of [[Francesco Rutelli]]. Nevertheless, for the first time an MSI candidate received significant support in a major election. [[Silvio Berlusconi]], then an entrepreneur but not involved in politics, affirmed on that occasion his preference for Fini: &quot;If I had to vote in Rome, my preference would go to Fini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lussana|first=Massimiliano|url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/a.pic1?ID=258539 |title=Gianfranco il freddo |publisher=Ilgiornale.it |date=2008-05-01 |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Berlusconi's election in 1994, for the first time in Italy's political history, an Italian government included four ministers from the MSI party, including the Deputy Prime Minister [[Giuseppe Tatarella]], although Fini did not directly take part as a minister. (Fini was not a minister at that time.)

During the 1990s Fini gradually began to move the MSI away from its [[fascism|neo-fascist]] ideology to a more traditionally [[Conservatism|conservative]] political agenda. In January 1995, the Party's congress in [[Fiuggi]] marked a radical change, afterwards referred to as ''la svolta di Fiuggi'' (the turning point at Fiuggi) and merged the [[MSI-DN]] with conservative elements of the disbanded [[Democrazia Cristiana|Christian Democrats]] to form the [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] (AN), of which Fini assumed the presidency.

The new party took a decisive stance distancing itself from fascism, and some MSI members ([[Pino Rauti]], Erra, Staiti) dissented and seceded to form the new [[Tricolor Flame]] party.

===Government experiences===
Fini and his party have been part of Berlusconi's right-wing [[House of Freedoms]] coalition which won the [[Italian general election, 1994|1994]] and [[Italian general election, 2001|2001 parliamentary election]]. Fini became [[deputy prime minister]] in 2001 and [[foreign minister]] in November 2004.

From February 2002 to 2006, he represented the Italian Government at the [[Convention on the Future of Europe|European Convention]]. Following the [[Italian general election, 2008|April 2008 general election]], Fini was elected [[President of the Chamber of Deputies]] on April 30, 2008 on the fourth ballot, receiving 355 votes.

His most widely known legislative acts have been:
* The ''[[Umberto Bossi|Bossi]]-Fini Act'', a restrictive law on [[immigration]];
* The ''Fini-Giovanardi Act'' (2006), a restrictive law on [[drugs]]. The act abolishes any distinction between soft drugs ([[cannabis]]) and hard drugs ([[heroin]], [[cocaine]]), punishing the user on the base of the quantity of [[active ingredient]] in the dose. As administrative sanctions, personal use of drugs is punished with a fine and the suspension of passport, driving license and/or weapon carrying permit. The cultivation of a single plant is punished with 1 up to 6 years of [[imprisonment]].

===From National Alliance to the People of Freedom===
After some discord between the party's factions in 2005, a congress dismantled the factions and confirmed Fini as president of the party.

In 2006, Fini announced the removal of the symbol of the flame and of the &quot;M.S.I.&quot; writing from [[National Alliance (Italy)|AN]] symbol. The move, after facing opposition from party members such as [[Maurizio Gasparri]] was finally denied.

Fini began a personal evolution towards more liberal positions in the 2000s, notwithstanding the opposition of the rest of his party. In particular:
* in 2005 he announced a positive vote (three yes, one no) on a referendum on artificial insemination aimed at removing some limits introduced by the Act n.40/2004 of the same [[Berlusconi II Cabinet]].
* in December 2006 he declared he would be in favour of public acknowledgement of civil unions, including homosexual ones, although nonetheless in opposition to the centre-left government proposed bill on the theme.

At the end of January 2007, Berlusconi declared that Fini would be his only successor in case of unification of centre-right parties, provoking dissent from the [[Northern League]] and the [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]] (UDC).

In 2007 Berlusconi proclaimed the dissolution of his [[Forza Italia]] party and the birth of a new unitary party of the centre-right, [[the People of Freedom]]. At first, Fini reacted coldly, affirming that AN would not participate, judging the way the new party was born confused and superficial, and expressing open dissent against his ally of the &quot;former coalition&quot;.

However, two months later, he moved closer to Berlusconi again, soon after the fall of the [[Prodi II Cabinet]]. They agreed to present the two parties under the same symbol of [[the People of Freedom]] in the [[Italian general election, 2001|April 2008 parliamentary election]], and then to proceed towards a unitary centre-right party.

===Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies===
After the electoral victory, on 30 April 2008 after four rounds of voting, Fini was elected President (speaker) of the Chamber of Deputies, with 335 votes from a total of 611. He then resigned the presidency of AN in anticipation of unification with the new [[The People of Freedom|People of Freedom]] party.

Commenting on the homage to every victim of terrorism made by the President of the Republic, the former member of the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI) [[Giorgio Napolitano]], he announced &quot;the end of the post-war period&quot;, of &quot;the cleavage between the right and society&quot;, and of &quot;overcoming minority status&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Caselli|first=Dario|title=Fini spegne la fiamma ma scalda il cuore della destra|url=http://www.loccidentale.it/articolo/fini+spegne+la+fiamma+ma+scalda+il+cuore+della+destra|publisher=L'Occidentale|accessdate=27 October 2011|language=Italian|date=12 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pursuing his path of revision of the values of the Italian right, at the 2008 youth fest ''Atreju 2008'' he asserted that the Right has to acknowledge those rights &quot;present in the Constitution: freedom, equality and social justice. Values that determined and still determine the path of the Right, that are values of any democracy and that are fully anti-fascist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/politica/08_settembre_13/fini_antifascismo_ccb8bcec-8175-11dd-95db-00144f02aabc.shtml |title=«La destra si riconosca nell'antifascismo»|publisher=Corriere.it |date= |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his role of Speaker of the Chamber, he more than once rebuked the government, criticising their extensive use of the [[confidence vote]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [http://pezzedappoggio.ilcannocchiale.it/post/2141321.html ''Il Cannocchiale'', 13/01/2009]: L'ira di Fini: «Una cosa mai vista».&lt;/ref&gt;

He fought against the bad practices of absenteeism and double-voting by MPs in the Italian Parliament, promoting a digital voting system (to be implemented from March 2009) to prevent other MPs from voting on behalf of absent members, judging it &quot;immoral&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} {{cite web|author=|url=http://www.corriere.it/politica/09_gennaio_28/fini_dito_voto_camera_5dd5aae8-ed26-11dd-b7f1-00144f02aabc.shtml|title= Fini: si voterà solo con le impronte|accessdate= 6-03-2009|editor=''[[Corriere della Sera]]''|date= 28 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 19 MPs out of a total of 630 refused, however, to allow their [[Fingerprint recognition|fingerprints]] to be recorded, and the system was implemented on a voluntary basis.

He also negatively judged the desire of the Berlusconi government to intervene with a decree in the case of [[Eluana Englaro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [http://quotidianonet.ilsole24ore.com/cronaca/2009/02/05/149358-eluana_dubbi_napolitano_fini.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; and supported the need to defend the [[secularism]] of the State, being then criticized by members of UDC and of his own party.&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [http://it.notizie.yahoo.com/19/20090522/tpl-pdl-rotondi-ingiuste-critiche-a-fini-1204c2b_1.html ''Notizie Yahoo, 22May 2009]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent times he has become more and more vocally critical of the government platform, which he considers too biased towards the far-right federalist coalition party [[Lega Nord]]. This has brought him into conflict with Berlusconi himself.

He founded the parliamentarian group &quot;Futuro e libertà per l'Italia&quot; ([[Future and Freedom|Future and Freedom for Italy]]).

==Controversies==
The strongest criticisms of Fini from the Right are related to moves away from the traditional policies of the party. Apart from the &quot;Social Right&quot; area of his traditional rival [[Pino Rauti]], the right-wing intellectual [[Marcello Veneziani]] accused Fini of having lost any connection to right-wing thought (whether traditional, nostalgic, modern or conservative) and of representing an &quot;astral&quot; right, with no similarity to any other European right-wing group.&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [http://www.ilgiornale.it/a.pic1?ID=359582&amp;START=0&amp;2col= Veneziani: &quot;Fini? La sua è una destra marziana&quot;] Il Giornale - 17 giugno 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Further criticism of Fini came from the Lega Nord with respect to some aspects of [[federalism]] and [[Immigration to Italy#Immigration|immigration]], and from [[Forza Italia]] regarding justice.

Fini has lately been accused of being incoherent by some &quot;[[theo-con]]&quot; members, for holding socially conservative political positions while at the same time being separated and never married in Church.
* In 1999 Fini asked for forced hospitalization of drug users, without distinction between different illegal drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/scheda/191851/notiziario-antiproibizionista-del-25-ottobre-1999 |title=&quot;Ricovero coatto per i drogati&quot; - Le dichiarazioni di Granfranco Fini |language={{it icon}} |publisher=Radioradicale.it |date=1999-10-25 |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On January 29, 2006, after Senate approval of the Fini-sponsored drug bill which strengthened the law against [[marijuana]] and promoted it to a class 1 drug, putting it in the same category as [[heroin]] and [[cocaine]], giving dealers the same penalty as dealers in hard drugs and users the same fines for consumption, Fini, as a guest on the popular TV-Show ''Che tempo che fa'', hosted by [[Fabio Fazio]], admitted to having smoked [[marijuana]] while on vacation in [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIURAEHcbg0 Video]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In May 2008, he sparked outrage when he said that the burning of an Israeli flag was much worse than the murder of a 29-year-old man in Verona, savagely beaten to death by a local group of skinheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Israely |first=Jeff |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1737829,00.html |title=TIME |publisher=TIME |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* He ignited controversy when he stated that the racial laws were not the sole responsibility of the Fascist regime, but also that Italian civil society and the Roman Catholic Church had to have their share of the blame as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agi.it/italy/news/200812161317-pol-ren0032-art.html AGI]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At a press conference to the Foreign Press Association, he was asked for his thoughts on [[Benito Mussolini]]. A journalist reminded him that 15 years earlier he had called the dictator the greatest statesman of the century. Fini replied: &quot;I'm fascinated by your question.... clearly the answer is in what I've done in the past 15 years. Today my answer is no, I have changed my mind, otherwise I would be schizophrenic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agi.it/italy/news/200903251721-pol-ren0057-art.html AGI]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In August 2010, after becoming a leading critic of Berlusconi and threatening Berlusconi's majority in parliament, a newspaper owned by the Berlusconi family implicated Fini with a condo in [[Monte Carlo]]. The condo was previously owned by the [[National Alliance]] political party. The party sold the condo in 2008 to an offshore company and it was leased back to the younger brother of Fini's girlfriend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/02/silvio-berlusconi-giacomo-caliendo-vote Berlusconi minister faces parliamentary vote over corruption claims], [http://www.guardian.co.uk/ The Guardian - UK], 2 August 2010, Retrieved 17 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Giorgio Napolitano''' ({{IPA-it|ˈdʒordʒo napoliˈtaːno}}; born 29 June 1925) is an [[Italy|Italian]] politician who has been the [[List of Presidents of the Italian Republic|11th]] [[President of Italy]] since 2006. A long-time member of the [[Italian Communist Party]] and later the [[Democrats of the Left]], he served as [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|President of the Chamber of Deputies]] from 1992 to 1994 and as [[Italian Minister of the Interior|Minister of the Interior]] from 1996 to 1998.

Appointed as a [[Senator for life]] in 2005, he was subsequently [[Italian presidential election, 2006|elected as President of Italy]] on 10 May 2006; his term started with the swearing-in ceremony held on 15 May 2006. He is the first President of Italy to have been a member of the Italian Communist Party.

== Early life ==
Giorgio Napolitano was born in [[Naples]]. In 1942 he matriculated at the [[University of Naples Federico II]]. He adhered to the local University Fascist Youth (&quot;Gioventù Universitaria Fascista&quot;), where he met his core group of friends, who shared his opposition to [[Italian fascism]]. As he would later state, the group &quot;was in fact a true breeding ground of [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] intellectual energies, disguised and to a certain extent tolerated&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autobio&quot;&gt;{{cite book

 | publisher = Laterza | location = | language = Italian | isbn = 88-420-7715-1
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A theatre enthusiast since high school, during his university years he contributed a theatrical review to the ''[[IX Maggio (magazine)|IX Maggio]]'' weekly magazine, and had small parts in plays organised by the ''Gioventù Universitaria Fascista'' itself.  He played in a comedy by [[Salvatore Di Giacomo]] at [[Teatro Mercadante]] in Naples. Napolitano dreamed of being an actor and spent his early years performing in several productions at the Teatro Mercadante. {{citation needed|date=March 2011}} He later measured himself against [[James Joyce|Joyce]] and [[George Eliot|Eliot]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Napolitano has often been cited as the author of a collection of [[sonnet]]s in [[Neapolitan language]], published under the [[pseudonym]] Tommaso Pignatelli, entitled ''&quot;Pe cupià ’o chiarfo&quot;'' (&quot;To mimic the downpour&quot;). He denied this in 1997 and, again, on the occasion of his presidential election, when his staff described the attribution of authorship to Napolitano as a &quot;journalistic myth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=''[[La Repubblica]]'' | title=Governo, Napolitano annuncia &quot;Martedì inizio le consultazioni&quot; | url=http://www.repubblica.it/2006/05/sezioni/politica/nuovo-presidente-5/napolitano-attesa-lunedi/napolitano-attesa-lunedi.html | accessdate=13 May 2006 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he published his first book called Movimento operaio e industria di Stato, which can be translated to Workers' Movement and State Industry in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/statico/lingue/en/en-nap-biografia.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World War II ===

During the existence of the [[Italian Social Republic]], a puppet state of [[Nazi Germany]] in the final period of World War II, Napolitano and his circle of friends took part in several actions of the [[Italian resistance movement]] against German and Italian fascist forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;graziani&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Graziani, Nicola | title=Quirinale: Giorgio Napolitano, il compagno gentiluomo | url=http://www.agi.it/news.pl?doc=200605101328-1101-RT1-CRO-0-NF81&amp;page=0&amp;id=agionline.italyonline | accessdate=13 May 2006|language=Italian}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included occupying the offices of the ''IX Maggio'' magazine and using it to publish writings of [[Karl Marx]] masked as articles signed by the various components of the group.

=== From post-war years to the Hungarian revolution ===
Following the end of the war in 1945, Napolitano joined the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI). In 1947, he graduated in [[jurisprudence]] with a final dissertation on political economy, entitled ''&quot;Il mancato sviluppo industriale del Mezzogiorno dopo l'unità e la legge speciale per Napoli del 1904&quot;''. (Italian for &quot;The lack of industrial development in the [[Mezzogiorno]] following [[Italian unification|the unification of Italy]] and the special law of 1904 for Naples&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;off-bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=''Quirinale.it'' | title=Biography | url=http://www.quirinale.it/presidente/altrelingue/inglese/presidente-en.htm | accessdate=11 February 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070128072228/http://www.quirinale.it/presidente/altrelingue/inglese/presidente-en.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 28 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a member of the Sectariet of the Italian Economic Centre for southern Italy in 1946, which was represented by Senator Paratore, where he remained for two years. Napolitano played a major role in the Movement for the Rebirth of Southern Italy for over ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/statico/lingue/en/en-nap-biografia.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was first elected to the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]] in 1953 for the electoral division of [[Naples]], and was returned at every election until 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;off-bio&quot;/&gt; He was elected to the National Committee of the party during its eighth national congress in 1956, largely thanks to the support offered by [[Palmiro Togliatti]], who wanted to involve younger politicians in the central direction of the party. He became responsible for the commission for [[Southern Italy]] within the National Committee.&lt;ref name=&quot;camera&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=''Camera.it'' | title=Il Presidente Giorgio Napolitano | url=http://legxiv.camera.it/organiparlamentarism/6611/6558/6559/6570/documentotesto.asp | accessdate=11 February 2007|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on in the same year, the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and its military suppression by the [[Soviet Union]] occurred. The leadership of the Italian Communist Party labelled the insurgents as counter-revolutionaries, and the official party newspaper ''[[L'Unità]]'' referred to them as &quot;thugs&quot; and &quot;despicable agents provocateurs&quot;. Napolitano complied with the party-sponsored position on this matter, a choice he would repeatedly declare to have become uncomfortable with, developing what his autobiography describes as a &quot;grievous self-critical torment&quot;. He would reason that his compliance was motivated by concerns about the role of the Italian Communist Party as &quot;inseparable from the fates of the socialist forces guided by the USSR&quot; as opposed to &quot;imperialist&quot; forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;autobio&quot; /&gt;

The decision to support the USSR against the Hungarian revolutionaries generated a split in the Italian Communist Party, and even the [[Italian General Confederation of Labour|CGIL]] (Italy's largest [[trade union]], then supportive of the PCI) refused to conform to the party-sponsored position and applauded the revolution, on the basis that the eighth national congress of the Italian Communist Party had indeed stated that the &quot;Italian way to socialism&quot; was to be democratic and specific to the nation. These views were supported in the party by [[Giorgio Amendola]], whom Napolitano would always look up to as a teacher. Frequently seen together, Giorgio Amendola and Giorgio Napolitano would jokingly be referred to by friends as (respectively) ''Giorgio 'o chiatto'' and ''Giorgio 'o sicco'' (&quot;Giorgio the pudgy&quot; and &quot;Giorgio the slim&quot; in the [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan dialect]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;corriere&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' | title=&quot;Principe rosso&quot;, violò il tabù del Viminale | url=http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Politica/2006/05_Maggio/08/principe-rosso.shtml | accessdate=11 February 2007 | language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From the 1960s to the dissolution of the Italian Communist Party ===
Napolitano then became the party's federal secretary in Naples and [[Caserta]] and later, between 1966 and 1969, he was coordinator of the secretary's office and of the political office. During the 1970s and the 1980s he was the officer responsible first for culture and later for the [[economic policy]] and the [[international relations]] of the party.

Napolitano's political ideas were somewhat moderate in the context of the PCI: in fact he became the leader of the so-called [[meliorism (politics)|meliorist]] wing (''corrente migliorista'') of the party, whose members notably included [[Gerardo Chiaromonte]] and [[Emanuele Macaluso]]. The term ''migliorista'' (from ''migliore'', Italian for &quot;better&quot;) was coined with a slightly mocking intent.

In the mid-1970s, Napolitano was invited by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] to give a lecture, but the United States [[ambassador]] to Italy, [[John A. Volpe]], refused to grant Napolitano a [[visa (document)|visa]] on account of his membership of the PCI. Between 1977 and 1981 Napolitano had some secret meetings with the United States ambassador [[Richard N. Gardner|Richard Gardner]], at a time when the PCI was seeking contact with the US administration, in the context of its definitive break with its past relationship with the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and the beginning of [[eurocommunism]], the attempt to develop a theory and practice more adequate to the democratic countries of Western Europe. He was an active member of the party until it ended in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;mahalo.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mahalo.com/giorgio-napolitano/ |title=Giorgio Napolitano |publisher=Mahalo.com |date= |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, when Napolitano was elected President of the Italian Republic, Gardner stated to [[Associated Press|AP Television News]] that he considered Napolitano &quot;a real statesman&quot;, &quot;a true believer in democracy&quot; and &quot;a friend of the United States [who] will carry out his office with impartiality and fairness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=[[CNN]] | title=Italy finally agrees on president | url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/05/10/italy.president.ap/index.html | accessdate=13 May 2006}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to this role and in part by the good offices of [[Giulio Andreotti]], in the 1980s Napolitano was able to travel to the United States and give lectures at [[Aspen, Colorado]] and at [[Harvard University]]. He has since visited and lectured in the United States several times.

=== After the dissolution ===
[[Image:Nicolae Ceauşescu a lui Giorgio Napolitano.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] with Giorgio Napolitano]]
After the dissolution of the Italian Communist Party, in 1991, Napolitano joined the [[Democratic Party of the Left]], later [[Democrats of the Left]]. Successively, he served as President of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]] (1992–1994), and between 1996 and 1998 he was the first former Communist to become [[Italian Minister of the Interior|Minister of the Interior]], a role traditionally occupied by [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]]. In this capacity, he took part together with fellow lawmaker and Cabinet Minister [[Livia Turco]] in drafting the government-sponsored law on immigration control (Legislative Decree No. 40 of 6 March 1998), better known as the &quot;Turco–Napolitano bill&quot;. Napolitano also served a second term as a [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] from 1999 to 2004 as member of the [[Party of European Socialists]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/members/archive/term3/view.do?language=EN&amp;id=1103&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2005, he was named [[senator for life]], and was therefore one of the last two to be appointed by [[List of Presidents of the Italian Republic|President of the Republic]] [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]], together with [[Sergio Pininfarina]].

== Election as president ==
{{Main|Italian presidential election, 2006}}
In 2006, his name was frequently suggested for the office of President of the Italian Republic. Napolitano was the second person proposed by the [[centre-left]] majority coalition [[The Union (political coalition)|The Union]], in place of [[Massimo D'Alema]], after the chance of a joint vote on D'Alema had been rejected by leaders of the [[centre-right]] coalition the [[House of Freedoms]]. Even though Napolitano appeared at first a candidate that the House of Freedoms could converge on, the proposal was rejected much like that of D'Alema.

The centre-left majority coalition, on 7 May 2006, officially endorsed Giorgio Napolitano as its candidate in the [[Italian presidential election, 2006|presidential election]] that began on 8 May. The [[Holy See|Vatican]] endorsed him as President through its official newspaper, ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'', just after The Union named him as its candidate, as did [[Marco Follini]], former secretary of the [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]], a member party of the House of Freedoms.

Napolitano was elected on 10 May, in the fourth round of voting—the first of which required only an absolute majority, unlike the former three which required two-thirds of the votes—with 543 votes (out of a possible 1009).  At the age of 80, he became the first former Communist to become President of Italy, as well as the third Neapolitan after [[Enrico De Nicola]] and [[Giovanni Leone]]. He came out of retirement to accept.&lt;ref name=&quot;mahalo.com&quot;/&gt; After his election, expressions of esteem toward his person and his authority as future [[President of the Italian Republic]] were made by both members of The Union and of the House of Freedoms (who had issued a [[none of the above|blank vote]]), such as [[Pier Ferdinando Casini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=''[[La Repubblica]]'' | title=Da Berlusconi auguri con freddezza. Calderoli: &quot;Non lo riconosciamo&quot; | url=http://www.repubblica.it/2006/05/sezioni/politica/nuovo-presidente-4/commenti-centrodestra/commenti-centrodestra.html | accessdate=16 May 2006 | language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some Italian right-wing newspapers, such as ''[[il Giornale]]'', expressed concerns about his communist past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=''[[Il Giornale]]'' | title=Sul colle sventola bandiera rossa | format=PDF | url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/pag_pdf.php?ID=25532 | accessdate=14 May 2006 | language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started his term on 15 May.

== Tenure ==
On 9 July 2006, Napolitano was present at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]] final, in which the [[Italy national football team|Italian team]] defeated France and won its fourth World Cup, and afterwards he joined the players' celebrations. He is the second President of the Italian Republic to be present at a triumphal World Cup final, after [[Sandro Pertini]].

On 26 September 2006, Napolitano made an official visit to [[Budapest]], Hungary, where he paid tribute to the fallen in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 revolution]], which he initially opposed as member of the Italian Communist Party, by laying a wreath at Imre Nagy's grave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=''[[International Herald Tribune]]''|title=Italy's president pays tribute in Hungary to 1956 revolution|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/26/europe/EU_GEN_Hungary_Italy_1956.php|accessdate=6 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Obama Napolitano.jpg|left|thumb|[[Barack Obama]] and Napolitano at [[Quirinale Palace]] in [[Rome]]]]
On 10 February 2007 a [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] crisis arose between Italy and [[Croatia]], after President Napolitano took an official speech during celebration of the [[National Memorial Day of the Exiles and Foibe]] in which he stated:&lt;ref&gt;Presidenza della Repubblica, Giorgio Napolitano, official speech for the celebration of &quot;Giorno del Ricordo&quot; Quirinal, february 10, 2007 [http://www.quirinale.it/elementi/Continua.aspx?tipo=Discorso&amp;key=930 integral text from official website of the Italian President Bureau]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|...Already in the unleashing of the first wave of blind and extreme violence in those lands, in the autumn of 1943, summary and tumultuous justicialism, nationalist paroxysm, social retaliation and a plan to eradicate Italian presence intertwined in what was, and ceased to be, the Julian March.
There was therefore a movement of hate and bloodthirsty fury, and a Slavic annexationist design, which prevailed above all in the peace treaty of 1947, and assumed the sinister shape of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;.
What we can say for sure is that what was consumed – in the most evident way trough the inhuman ferocity of the ''foibe'' – was one of the barbarities of the past century.|&lt;small&gt;Italian president Giorgio Napolitano, Rome, 10 February 2007&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''«....Già nello scatenarsi della prima ondata di cieca violenza in quelle terre, nell'autunno del 1943, si intrecciarono giustizialismo sommario e tumultuoso, parossismo nazionalista, rivalse sociali e un disegno di sradicamento della presenza italiana da quella che era, e cessò di essere, la Venezia Giulia. Vi fu dunque un moto di odio e di furia sanguinaria, e un disegno annessionistico slavo, che prevalse innanzitutto nel Trattato di pace del 1947, e che assunse i sinistri contorni di una &quot;pulizia etnica&quot;. Quel che si può dire di certo è che si consumò – nel modo più evidente con la disumana ferocia delle foibe – una delle barbarie del secolo scorso.»'' from the official website of The Presidency of the Italian Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, [http://www.quirinale.it/elementi/Continua.aspx?tipo=Discorso&amp;key=930 official speech for the celebration of &quot;Giorno del Ricordo&quot;] Quirinal, Rome, february 10 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}} The European Commission did not comment on this event, but did comment on (and partly condemn) the response by Croatian president [[Stjepan Mesić]], who described Napolitano's statement as racist because Napolitano did not refer to either Slovenians or Croatians as a nation when he spoke about a &quot;Slavic annexationist design&quot; for the [[Julian March]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unita.it/view.asp?IDcontent=63512 |title=l'Unità.it – Giorgio Napolitano: «Foibe ignorate per cecità e calcolo» – Politica |publisher=Unita.it |date=20 September 2008 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (at the time, Slovenians and Croatians fought together in the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Yugoslav Resistance Movement]]). Another matter of debate in Croatia was that the Italian President made awards to relatives of 25 foibe victims, who included the last fascist Italian [[prefect]] in [[Zadar]], [[Vincenzo Serrentino]], convicted to death in 1947 in [[Šibenik]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ravennainforma.com/news.php?id=2965 Ravennainforma.com]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alleanzanazionalelodi.it/an2005/dettagli.asp?id=&amp;eventid=4420 Alleanzanazionalelodi.it]&lt;/ref&gt; That was seen by Mesić as &quot;historic revisionism&quot; and open support for [[revanchism]]. President Napolitano's remarks on the foibe massacres were praised by both centre-left and centre-right in Italy, and both coalitions condemned Mesić's statements, while the whole of Croatia stood by Mesić, who later acknowledged that Napolitano didn't want to put in discussion the [[Treaty of peace with Italy (1947)|Peace Treaty]] of 1947.

===2008 political crisis===

On 24 January 2008, [[Romano Prodi]] lost a vote of confidence in the Senate by a vote of 161 to 156 votes, after the [[UDEUR Populars for the South|UDEUR Populars]] ended its support for the [[Prodi II Cabinet|Prodi-led government]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC loses&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7208000.stm | title = Prodi loses crucial Senate vote  | publisher = BBC | author =   | date = 24 January 2008 | accessdate =24 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Napolitano requested the president of the Senate, [[Franco Marini]], to assess the possibility to form a [[caretaker government]]. On 4 February 2008, Marini acknowledged the impossibility of forming an interim government because the centre-right parties would not join,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aloisi |first=Silvia |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/world/20080204-1053-italy-government-.html |title=News World – Italy Senate speaker fails to form govt, vote looms |publisher=Signonsandiego.com |date=4 February 2008 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 6 February 2008 Napolitano dissolved the Parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ansa scioglimento&quot;&gt;{{it icon}} {{cite web | url = http://www.ansa.it/opencms/export/site/visualizza_fdg.html_12342748.html | title = Domani lo scioglimento delle camere  | publisher = [[Ansa]] | author = | date = 5 February 2008 | accessdate =5 February 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080204214404/http://www.ansa.it/opencms/export/site/visualizza_fdg.html_12342748.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 4 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italian general election, 2008|Elections were held]] on 13 April and 14 April 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jJDXtKn83PJ0X2f_f8ALmkK4-G7g |title=AFP: Italy heads towards fresh elections |publisher=Afp.google.com |date=5 February 2008 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with the administrative elections, and won by a coalition of facist, right-wing and center-right parties.

On 7 May 2008, President Napolitano offered [[Silvio Berlusconi]] the post of Head of the Italian government, following his victory in the general election. The cabinet was officially inaugurated one day later, with Berlusconi thus becoming the second Prime Minister under President Napolitano.

=== Eluana Englaro incident ===
On 6 February 2009, President Napolitano refused to sign an emergency decree made by the Berlusconi government in order to suspend a final court sentence allowing suspension of nutrition to 38-year old coma patient [[Eluana Englaro]]; the decree was enacted by Berlusconi himself despite being already notified by Napolitano regarding the unconstitutionality of such a measure. This caused a major political debate within Italy regarding the relationship between the President and the government in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7876961.stm |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=27 April 2009 |date=7 February 2009 |title=Italian right-to-die row deepens }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2011 political crisis and new government ===
In November 2011, after barely surviving a motion of no confidence in December 2010, Berlusconi resigned from his post as head of the government, having lost the trust of the Parliament following increasingly dramatic financial and economical conditions. President Napolitano then decided to appoint former EU commissioner [[Mario Monti]] as a senator for life, and then as prime minister designate. Monti was subsequently confirmed by an overwhelming majority of both houses of the Italian Parliament, in what was widely referred to as a &quot;government of the president&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;newyorktimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/03/world/europe/president-giorgio-napolitano-italys-quiet-power-broker.html |publisher=The New York Times |date=3 December 2011 |accessdate=1 January 2012 |title=From Ceremonial Figure to Italy’s Quiet Power Broker|author=Rachel Donadio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Napolitano's management of the events caused unprecedented worldwide media exposure regarding his role as President of the Italian Republic (usually referred to as nothing more than a ceremonial one) and also won him the nickname &quot;King George&quot; from ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;newyorktimes&quot; /&gt;

'''Giuliano Amato''' (born 13 May 1938 in [[Turin]]) is an Italian politician. He was [[Prime Minister of Italy]] twice, first from 1992 to 1993 and then from 2000 to 2001. He was more recently Vice President of the [[Convention on the Future of Europe]] that drafted the new [[European Constitution]] and headed the [[Amato Group]]. He is commonly nicknamed ''dottor Sottile'', (which means  &quot;[[Doctor Subtilis]]&quot;, the sobriquet of the Scottish Medieval philosopher John Duns Scotus, a reference to his political subtlety). From 2006 to 2008, he was the [[Italian Minister of the Interior|Minister of the Interior]] in [[Romano Prodi]]'s government.

==Biography==

Born in [[Turin]] into a [[Sicily|Sicilian]] family, Amato grew up in [[Tuscany]]. He received a first degree in law from the [[University of Pisa]] in 1960, while attending the prestigious Collegio Medico-Giuridico of the [[Scuola Normale Superiore]], which today is [[Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies]], and a masters degree in comparative law from [[Columbia Law School]] in 1963. After teaching at the [[University of Modena|Universities of Modena]], [[University of Perugia|Perugia]] and [[University of Florence|Florence]], he worked as professor of Italian and Comparative Constitutional Law at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]] from 1975 to 1997.

Amato began his political career in 1958, when he joined the [[Italian Socialist Party]]. He was a Member of Parliament from 1983 to 1993. He was Undersecretary of State to the Prime Minister's office from 1983 to 1987, Deputy Prime Minister from 1987 to 1988, and Minister for the Treasury from 1987 to 1989. 

From June 1992 to April 1993, Amato served as Prime Minister. During those ten months, a series of [[political corruption|corruption]] scandals rocked Italy and swept away almost an entire class of political leaders. Amato himself was never implicated, notwithstanding how close he was to [[Bettino Craxi]], a central figure in the corruption system.

As Prime Minister, Amato responded effectively to two [[devaluation]]s of the [[Italian lira|lira]] in the wake of [[currency speculation]] that led Italy to be expelled from the [[European Monetary System]] by cutting the [[budget deficit]] drastically, thus taking the first steps in the road that would bring Italy to adopt the [[Euro]].

At a point, his government was harshly contested because of a [[decree]] that suddenly moved the competence for corruption investigations into the hands of the [[police]], which, being controlled directly by the government, would have not been independent. Fearing that the new system would have effectively blocked investigations on political corruption, Italians took to the streets in massive, spontaneous rallies. President [[Oscar Luigi Scalfaro]] refused to sign the decree, deeming it blatantly unconstitutional. While his justice minister [[Giovanni Conso]] took the blame, it has been disputed whether Amato was a victim of circumstances or whether he really wanted to save the corruption-ridden system.

At the end of his period as Prime Minister, Amato gave a speech to the Parliament in which he solemnly promised that at end of his term he would retire from politics, stressing that his was a true commitment and that he would not break this promise as some politicians (whom he characterized as &quot;[[mandarin (China)|mandarin]]s&quot;) used to do. However, this promise was short-lived; Amato has regularly come under criticism for having made such a solemn commitment and failìng to keep it.

Amato was President of the Italian [[antitrust]] authority from November 1994 to December 1997, Minister for Institutional Reforms in [[Massimo D'Alema]]'s first government from October 1998 to May 1999, and, once again, Treasury Minister in D'Alema's second government from December 1999 to April 2000. Amato was nearly nominated for the Presidency of the Republic and was a close contender to replace [[Michel Camdessus]] as head of the [[International Monetary Fund]].

Amato served as Prime Minister again from April 2000 to May 2001. He promoted economic competitiveness as well as social protection. In addition to economic reforms, he pushed ahead with political and institutional reforms, trying to deal with a weak executive and fragmented legislature.

In December 2001, [[European Union]] leaders at the [[European Council]] in [[Laeken]] appointed Amato and former Belgian Prime Minister [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] to be Vice Presidents of the Convention on the Future of Europe to assist former French President [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] in the drafting of the new European Constitution. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amato was a Member of the Senate representing the constituency of [[Grosseto]] in [[Tuscany]] from 2001 to 2006. In 2006, he was elected to the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]] for the [[The Olive Tree (political coalition)|Olive Tree]] list, and he was named Minister of the Interior in Romano Prodi's centre-left government.

Since 2010, he also leads advanced seminar classes at the [http://sog.luiss.it/programs/mipa/ Master in International Public Affairs] of the [http://www.sog.luiss.it LUISS School of Government]. 

Amato is married to Ms Diana Amato, a professor of Family Law at the University of Rome. They have two children, Elisa and Lorenzo, and five grandchildren, Giulia, Marco, Simone, Elena and Irene.

'''Giulio Tremonti''' ({{IPA-it|ˈdʒuːljo treˈmonti}}) (born August 18, 1947) is an [[Italy|Italian]] politician. He served in the government of Italy as Minister of Economy and Finance under Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]] from 1994 to 1995, from 2001 to 2004, from 2005 to 2006, and from 2008 to 2011.
==Career==
Tremonti is a full professor of law at the [[University of Pavia]], Italy, and has been a Visiting Professor at the Institute of Comparative Law, Oxford. His particular fields of interest are fiscal and tributary law, as well as fiscal policies.

Born in [[Sondrio]], Northern [[Lombardy]], in a family of [[Veneto|Venetian]] ancestry (from [[Lorenzago di Cadore]], Northern [[Veneto]]), he was the man who facilitated the dialogue between billionaire entrepreneur/politician [[Silvio Berlusconi]] and [[Umberto Bossi]], leader of the federalist [[Northern League (Italy)|Northern League]] and a friend of Tremonti's, leading to the formation of the center-right coalition [[House of Freedoms]]. Although a  member of Forza Italia, on many issues he is closer to the League. In particular, he is a staunch [[federalism|political]] and [[fiscal federalism|fiscal federalist]], supporting a federal reform of the Italian political system and more autonomy for Lombardy and Veneto, where he has his core supporters.

He first ran for the [[Parliament of Italy|Italian Parliament]] in 1987 with the [[Italian Socialist Party]]. Elected for the first time in 1994 for the [[Pact for Italy]], he switched his allegiance to center-right [[Forza Italia]] soon after the Parliament held session, and obtained the Finance position in the first Berlusconi cabinet.

Tremonti again served as Finance Minister from 2001 to 2004 when Berlusconi came back to power. He was compelled to resign after internal disputes about the economic situation of the country within the House of Freedoms, particularly with conservative [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]]. In late 2005 he was then reappointed to the same position for a third time after his substitute [[Domenico Siniscalco]] resigned until the end of the Berlusconi III Cabinet. At 2008 general elections Berlusconi came back to power with a large majority in the parliament and assigned Tremonti the Economics and Finance position. At the end of 2011, following some rumors Tremonti would close to leave Pdl and to adhere to the [[Northern League]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailyblog.it/tremonti-alla-lega/29/12/2011/&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time in office,  Tremonti made the first and biggest across the board [[Income tax]] cuts in Italy by introducing a No-Tax-Area (2003) and reducing the top marginal tax rate (2005). He also made a significant reduction in the [[Corporate tax]] rate (from 36% to 33% now down to 27.5%) and has abolished taxes on reinvested profits. He has also completely abolished all Donation taxes, Estate/[[Inheritance]] taxes (2001) and more importantly [[Property taxes]] on Housing/Real Estate (2008) at the national level (property continues to be taxed at the local level). Nevertheless, after these measures, the [[OECD]] stated in its latest (2007) report on Italy that &quot;tax rates are high compared to other countries&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/LongAbstract/0,3425,en_33873108_33873516_38698716_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=Economic Survey of Italy 2007 |publisher=OECD |date=2007-06-04 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently he has been the promoter of the Global Legal Standards.

As an author, during his life Tremonti has written mostly on taxation and international trade. He expressed how high taxes are a drag for growth and how fiscal federalism can create territorial taxation competition between regions that can reduce the burden on families and workers. He has also been a critic of China's dumping trade policy that causes delocalization of jobs from Europe to Asia.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Tremonti was always fairly suspicious of globalization, once remarking that Europe would end up in the pot of a Chinese cook if it wasn’t careful.&quot; Tony Barber, Financial Times, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless in 2009 he gave an important lecture at the [[Central Party School of the Communist Party of China]].

He is currently Chairman of the [[Aspen Institute|Aspen Institute Italia]] and a frequent guest columnist on the ''[[Corriere della Sera]]''.

The [[Italy|Italian]] '''Chamber of Deputies''' ({{lang-it|'''Camera dei Deputati'''}}) is the [[lower house]] of the [[Parliament of Italy]] (the other being [[Italian_Senate|The Senate of the Republic]]). The two houses together form a perfect bicameral system, meaning they perform identical functions, but do so separately. Pursuant to article 56 of the [[Constitution_of_Italy|Italian Constitution]], the Chamber of Deputies has 630 seats, of which 618 are elected from Italian constituencies, and 12 from Italian citizens living abroad. Currently , a plurality of seats is controlled by the [[Liberal_conservatism|liberal-conservative]] party [[People of Freedom]]. Deputies meet in the [[Palazzo Montecitorio]], and a member of the Chamber of Deputies has the style of ''onorevole'' ([[honourable]]). Its current president (i.e. its [[Speaker (politics)|speaker]]) is [[Gianfranco Fini]], the leader of the [[Future and Freedom]] party.

== The Seat ==
[[File:Palazzo Montecitorio Rom 2009.jpg|300px|righr|thumb|The [[Palazzo Montecitorio]].]]
The seat of the Chamber of Deputies is the [[Palazzo Montecitorio]], where it has met since [[1871]], shortly after the capital of the [[Kingdom_of_Italy_(1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] was moved to [[Rome]].

The previous seat of the Chamber of Deputies of the Kingdom of Italy was the [[Palazzo Carignano]] in [[Torino]] ([[1861]]-[[1865]]) and the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] in [[Firenze]] (1865-1871). During the [[Italian_fascism|fascist]] regime, from [[1939]] to [[1943]], the Chamber of Deputies was abolished and replaced by the [[Chamber of Fasci and Corporations]].

==The Electoral System==
===Current System===

The election of members to the Chamber of Deputies is by voluntary, universal, direct suffrage by all citizens of age on election day. Terms last for a total of five years, unless an early dissolution of the Chamber is called by the [[President of Italy]] as a result of parliamentary deadlock, at which point a [[snap election]] is held. Unlike the Senate, which requires members to be 40 years of age, members of the Chamber of Deputies may be elected at 25.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.camera.it/4?scheda_informazioni=3&lt;/ref&gt;

Under current law, members of the Chamber of Deputies are elected through a [[Party-list_proportional_representation|party-list proportional system]]. They are eligible for the allocation of seats based on three criteria: first, they are eligible for seats if the coalition to which their party belongs has reached a minimum of 10% of total valid votes. Within the coalition, the party must also have 2% of total, valid votes to garner seats. Beside these two criteria, it is also possible to participate in the allocation of seats if a party does not belong to a coalition but still receives 4% of total, valid votes.  

Article 61 of the [[Constitution_of_Italy|Italian Constitution]] maintains that elections for the Chamber of Deputies must take place within 70 days of the dissolution of house, and that representatives must convene within 20 days of those elections.

==Normal Operation of the Assembly==
The Chamber is composed of all members meeting in session at the Montecitorio. The assembly also has the right to attend meetings of the Government and its ministers. If required, the Government is obligated to attend the session. Conversely, the Government has the right to be heard every time it requires.
 
The term of office of the House (as well as the Senate) is five years, but can be extended in two cases:
*The &quot;prorogatio&quot;, as provided by art. 61.2 of the Constitution, states that representatives whose term has expired shall continue to exercise their functions until the first meeting of the new Chamber.
*An extension of the term, provided for by art. 60.2, can be enacted only in case of war.

The '''Kingdom of Italy''' ({{lang-it|'''Regno d'Italia'''}}) was a state forged in 1861 by the [[Italian unification|unification of Italy]] under the influence of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], which was its legal predecessor state. It existed until 1946 when the Italians opted for a [[republic]]an [[constitution]].

Italy declared war on [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] in alliance with [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] in 1866: despite an unsuccessful campaign, it received the region of [[Venice]] following [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]'s victory. Italian troops entered [[Rome]] in 1870, ending more than one thousand years of Papal temporal power. Italy accepted Bismarck's proposal to enter in a [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] with Germany and Austria in 1882, following strong disagreements with France about the respective colonial expansions. However, even if relations with [[Berlin]] became very friendly, the alliance with [[Vienna]] remained purely formal. So, in 1915, Italy accepted the British invitation to join the Allies in [[World War I]] because the western allies promised territorial compensation (at the expense of Austria-Hungary) for participation that were more generous than Vienna's offer in exchange for Italian neutrality. Victory in the war gave Italy the status of a [[great power|major power]], with a permanent seat in the Council of the [[League of Nations]].

&quot;Fascist Italy&quot; is the era of [[National Fascist Party]] rule from 1922 to 1943 with [[Benito Mussolini]] as totalitarian leader. The fascists imposed totalitarian rule and crushed the political and intellectual opposition, while promoting economic modernization, traditional social values, and a rapprochement with the Catholic Church.  &quot;The Fascist regime passed through several relatively distinct phases,&quot; says Payne (1996). The first phase 1923-25 was nominally a continuation of the parliamentary system, albeit with a &quot;legally organized executive dictatorship.&quot; Then came the second phase, &quot;the construction of the Fascist dictatorship proper from 1925 to 1929.&quot; The third phase, with less activism, was 1929-34. The fourth phase. 1935-40, was characterized by an aggressive foreign policy, warfare in Ethiopia, confrontations with the [[League of Nations]] sanctions, growing economic autarchy, and semi-Nazification. The war itself (1940–43) was the fifth phase, and the rump Salo regime the final stage (1943–45).&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne, ''A History of Fascism, 1914-1945'' (1996) p 212&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy was allied with [[Nazi Germany]] in World War II until 1943. It switched sides to the Allies after ousting Mussolini and shutting down the Fascist party in areas (south of Rome) controlled by the Allied invaders. The remnant fascist state in northern Italy that continued fighting against the Allies was a puppet state of Nazi Germany, the &quot;[[Italian Social Republic]]&quot;, still led by Mussolini and his loyalist Fascists.  Shortly after the war, civil discontent led to the [[Italian constitutional referendum, 1946]] on whether Italy would remain a monarchy or become a republic. Italians decided to abandon the monarchy and form the [[Italy|Italian Republic]], which is the present form of Italy today.

== Territory ==
The Kingdom of Italy claimed all of the territory which is modern-day Italy. The development of the Kingdom's territory progressed under [[Italian unification]] until 1870. The state for a long period of time did not have [[Trieste]] or [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], which are in Italy today, and only annexed them in 1919. After the Treaties of [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] and [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|St Germain]], the state was granted [[Gorizia]], Trieste and [[Istria]] (now part of [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]]), and small parts of modern-day northwestern [[Croatia]] as well as a tiny portion of the Croatian province of [[Dalmatia]]. During the second World War, the Kingdom gained more territory in Slovenia and more territory from Dalmatia. After the Second World War, the borders of present-day Italy were founded and the Kingdom abandoned its land claims.

The Kingdom of Italy also held colonies and protectorates and puppet states, such as modern-day [[Eritrea]], [[Somalia]], [[Libya]], Ethiopia (occupied by Italy in 1936, and then occupied by the British in World War II), [[Albania]], [[Greece]] (occupied in World War II), [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] (Italian and German puppet state in World War II), [[Kosovo]] (occupied in World War II), and [[Kingdom of Montenegro (1941-1944)|Montenegro]] (occupied in World War II), and a small 46 [[hectare]] section of land from [[China]] in [[Tianjin]] (see [[Concessions in Tianjin#Italian concession|Italian concession in Tianjin]]).

==Government==
The Kingdom of Italy was theoretically a [[constitutional monarchy]]. Executive power belonged to the [[King of Italy|monarch]], as executed through [[Prime Minister of Italy|appointed]] [[Council of Ministers of Italy|ministers]]. Two chambers of [[Parliament of Italy|parliament]] restricted the monarch's power– an appointive [[Italian Senate|Senate]] and an elective [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]]. The kingdom's [[constitution]] was the [[Statuto Albertino]], the former governing document of the Kingdom of Sardinia. In theory, ministers were solely responsible to the king. However, in practice, it was impossible for an Italian government to stay in office without the support of Parliament.

Members of the Chamber of Deputies were elected by [[plurality voting system]] elections in uninominal districts. A candidate needed the support of 50% of those voting, and of 25% of all enrolled voters, to be elected on the first round of balloting. If not all seats were filled on the first ballot, a runoff was held shortly afterwards for the remaining vacancies.

After a brief multinominal experimentation in 1882, [[proportional representation]] into large, regional, multi-seat electoral constituencies, was introduced after World War I. [[Socialist]]s became the major party, but they were unable to form a government into a parliament split into three different factions, with Christian [[Populism|Populists]] and [[Classical liberalism|classical liberals]]. Elections took place in 1919, 1921 and 1924: in this last occasion, Mussolini abolished the PR replacing it with a block voting system on national bases, which gave to the Fascist Party the absolute majority of the Chamber seats.

Between 1925 and 1943, Italy was quasi-[[De jure|de-jure]] [[Fascism|Fascist]] dictatorship, as the constitution formally remained in effect without alteration by the Fascists, though the monarchy also formally accepted Fascist policies and Fascist institutions. Changes in politics occurred, consisting of the establishment of the [[Grand Council of Fascism]] as a government body in 1928, which took control of the government system, and the Chamber of Deputies being replaced with the [[Chamber of Fasci and Corporations]] as of 1939.

== Monarchs ==
The monarchs of the [[House of Savoy]] who led Italy were
* '''[[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]]''' (1861–78) – Former [[King of Sardinia]] and first king of united Italy.
* '''[[Umberto I of Italy|Umberto I]]''' (1878–1900) – Approved the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] with [[Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]]. Assassinated in 1900 by an anarchist.
* '''[[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]]''' (1900–46 )– King of Italy during the First World War and during the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini.
* '''[[Umberto II of Italy|Umberto II]]''' (1946) – The last King of Italy who was pressured to call a referendum on whether Italy would retain the monarchy, in which Italians voted for a republic.

=== Unification process (1848–1870) ===
[[Image:Italy unification 1815 1870.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Italian unification]] process.]]
The creation of the Kingdom of Italy was the result of concerted efforts of Italian nationalists and monarchists loyal to the [[House of Savoy]] to establish a united kingdom encompassing the entire [[Italian Peninsula]].

After the [[Revolutions of 1848]], the apparent leader of the Italian unification movement was Italian revolutionary [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]. He was popular amongst southern Italians and in the world was renowned for his extremely loyal followers.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, Dennis Mack (1997) ''Modern Italy; A Political History'', Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, ISBN 0-472-10895-6, p15)&lt;/ref&gt; Garibaldi led the Italian republican drive for unification in southern Italy, but the northern Italian monarchy of the [[House of Savoy]] in the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], a ''de facto'' [[Piedmont]]ese state, whose government was led by [[Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour]], also had ambitions of establishing a united Italian state. Though the kingdom had no physical connection to [[Rome]] (deemed the natural capital of Italy, but still capital of the [[Papal States]]), the kingdom had successfully challenged [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] in the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], liberating [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia|Lombardy-Venetia]] from Austrian rule. The kingdom also had established important alliances which helped it improve the possibility of Italian unification, such as [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and the [[Second French Empire]] in the [[Crimean War]]. Sardinia was dependent on France being willing to protect it and in 1860, Sardinia was forced to cede territory to France to maintain relations, including Garibaldi's birthplace [[Nice]].

[[Image:Francesco Hayez 041.jpg|thumbnail|150px|left|[[Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour|Count Camillo Benso di Cavour]], the first Prime Minister of the unified Italy.]]
Cavour moved to challenge republican unification efforts by Garibaldi by organizing popular revolts in the [[Papal States]]. He used these revolts as a pretext to invade the country, even though the invasion angered the [[Catholics]], whom he told that the invasion was an effort to protect the [[Roman Catholic Church]] from the anti-clerical secularist nationalist republicans of Garibaldi. Only a small portion of the Papal States around Rome remained in the control of [[Pope Pius IX]].&lt;ref&gt;(Smith (1997), pp23–24)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their differences, Cavour agreed to include Garibaldi's [[Southern Italy]] allowing it to join the union with Piedmont-Sardinia in 1860. Subsequently the Parliament declared the creation of the Kingdom of Italy on February 18, 1861 (officially proclaiming it on [[Italian Unification|March 17, 1861]])  composed of both [[Northern Italy]] and Southern Italy. King [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]] of [[Piedmont-Sardinia]] from the [[House of Savoy]] was then declared [[King of Italy]], though he did not renumber himself with the assumption of the new title. This title had been out of use since the abdication of [[Napoleon I of France]] on April 6, 1814.

[[Image:Tranquillo Cremona - Vittorio Emanuele II.jpg|thumbnail|150px|right|[[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]], the first King of the united Italy.]]
Following the unification of most of Italy, tensions between the monarchists and republicans erupted. In April 1861, Garibaldi entered the Italian parliament and challenged Cavour's leadership of the government, accusing him of dividing Italy and spoke of the threat of civil war between the Kingdom in the north and Garibaldi's forces in the south. On June 6, 1861, the Kingdom's strongman Cavour died. During the ensuing political instability, Garibaldi and the republicans became increasingly revolutionary in tone. Garibaldi’s arrest in 1862 set off worldwide controversy.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith (1997), p61)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Giuseppe Garibaldi (1866).jpg|thumbnail|150px|left|[[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], major military leader during the Italian unification.]]
In 1866 [[Otto von Bismarck]], [[Minister President of Prussia]] offered Victor Emmanuel II an alliance with the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in the [[Austro-Prussian War]]. In exchange Prussia would allow Italy to annex Austrian-controlled [[Venice]]. King Emmanuel agreed to the alliance and the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] began. Italy fared poorly in the war with a badly organized military against Austria, but Prussia's victory allowed Italy to annex Venice. The one major obstacle to Italian unity remained Rome.

In 1870, Prussia went to war with France starting the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. To keep the large [[Prussian Army]] at bay, France abandoned its positions in Rome - which protected the remnants of the Papal States and Pius IX - in order to fight the Prussians. Italy benefited from Prussia's victory against France by being able to take over the Papal States from French authority. Rome was captured by the kingdom of Italy after several battles and guerilla-like warfare by [[Papal Zouaves]] and official troops of the Holy See against the Italian invaders. Italian unification was completed, and shortly afterward Italy's capital was moved to Rome. Economic conditions in the united Italy were poor:,&lt;ref&gt;(Smith (1997), pp95–96)&lt;/ref&gt; there were no industry or transportation facilities, extreme poverty (especially in the [[Mezzogiorno]]), high illiteracy, and only a small percent of wealthy Italians had the right to vote. The unification movement had largely been dependent on the support of foreign powers and remained so afterwards.

Following the capture of Rome in 1870 from French forces of [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]], Papal troops, and [[Zouave#Papal Zouaves|Zouaves]], relations between Italy and the [[Holy See|Vatican]] remained sour for the next sixty years with the [[Pope]]s declaring themselves to be [[prisoner in the Vatican|prisoners in the Vatican]]. The Catholic Church frequently protested the actions of the secular and anticlerical-influenced Italian governments, refused to meet with envoys from the King and urged Catholics not to vote in Italian elections.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith (1997), p91)&lt;/ref&gt; It would not be until 1929, that positive relations would be restored between the Kingdom of Italy and the Vatican after the signing of the [[Lateran Pacts]].

=== Liberal period (1870–1914) ===
[[Image:Sommer, Giorgio (1834-1914) - n. 3931 - Galleria V. E. (Milano).jpg|thumb|200px|[[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]] in [[Milan]]. An architectural work created in the 1880s and named after the first King of Italy, [[Victor Emmanuel II]].]]
After unification, Italy's politics favored [[liberalism]]&lt;ref&gt;In 1848 [[Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour|Cammillo Benso di Cavour]] had formed a parliamentarty group in the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] Parliament named &quot;Italian Liberal Party&quot; (''Partito Liberale Italiano''). From 1860, with the [[Italian unification|Unification of Italy]] substantially realized and the death of Cavour himself in 1861, the Liberal Party was split in at least two major factions or new parties later known as the ''Destra Storica'' on the right wing, who substantially assembled the Count of Cavour's followers and political heirs, and the ''Sinistra Storica'' on the left wing, who mostly reunited the followers and sympathizers of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] and other former [[Giuseppe Mazzini|Mazzinians]]. Both the Historical Right (''Destra Storica'') and the Historical Left (''Sinistra Storica'') were composed of monarchist liberals, while radicals organized themselves as [[Radical Party (Italy, 1877)|Radical Party]] and republicans as [[Italian Republican Party]].&lt;/ref&gt;: the Liberal-conservative right (''Destra storica'' or Historical right) was regionally fragmented,&lt;ref&gt;The Liberal-conservative Historical Right was dominated from 1860 to 1876 (but also after it was no more at the govern) by a leadership of elected Representatives from [[Emilia Romagna]] (1860-64) and [[Tuscany]] (1864-1876), known as the &quot;''Consorteria''&quot;, with the support of the Lombard and Southern italian Representatives. The majority of the piedmontese Liberal-conservative Representatives, but not all of them, organized themselves as the, all-Piedmontese and more right-wing, Party's minority &quot;''Associazione Liberale Permanente''&quot;, whom sometimes voted with the Historical Left and whose leading Representative was [[Quintino Sella]]. The Party's majority was also weakened by the substantial differences between the effective Liberal-conservative (Tuscan and Emilian) leadership and Lombards on one side and the quietly conservative Southerner and ''Transigent catholic'' components on the other. ([[Indro Montanelli]], &quot;Storia d'Italia&quot;, volume 32).&lt;/ref&gt; and Liberal-conservative Prime Minister [[Marco Minghetti]] only held on to power by enacting revolutionary and left-leaning policies (such as the nationalization of railways) to appease the opposition. In 1876, Minghetti was ousted and replaced by Liberal [[Agostino Depretis]], who began the long Liberal Period. The Liberal Period was marked by corruption, government instability, continued poverty in southern Italy, and use of authoritarian measures by the Italian government.

Depretis began his term as Prime Minister by initiating an experimental political idea called ''[[Trasformismo]]'' (transformism). The theory of ''trasformismo'' was that a cabinet should select a variety of moderates and capable politicians from a non-partisan perspective. In practice, ''trasformismo'' was authoritarian and corrupt, Depretis pressured districts to vote for his candidates if they wished to gain favourable concessions from Depretis when in power. The results of the Italian general election of 1876 resulted in only four representatives from the right being elected, allowing the government to be dominated by Depretis. Despotic and corrupt actions are believed to be the key means in which Depretis managed to keep support in southern Italy. Depretis put through authoritarian measures, such as banning public meetings, placing &quot;dangerous&quot; individuals in internal exile on remote penal islands across Italy and adopting militarist policies. Depretis enacted controversial legislation for the time, such as abolishing arrest for debt, making elementary education free and compulsory while ending compulsory religious teaching in elementary schools.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith (1997), pp. 95–107)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Triple Alliance.png|thumb|325px|left|The [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] in 1913, shown in red.]]
In 1887, [[Francesco Crispi]] became Prime Minister and began focusing government efforts on foreign policy. Crispi worked to build Italy as a great world power though increased military expenditures, advocacy of expansionism,&lt;ref&gt;(Smith (1997), pp132–133)&lt;/ref&gt; and trying to win the favour of the [[German Empire]]. Italy joined the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] which included both Germany and [[Austria–Hungary]] in 1882 and which remained officially intact until 1915. While helping Italy develop strategically, he continued ''trasformismo'' and was authoritarian, once suggesting the use of martial law to ban opposition parties.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith (1997), p133)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being authoritarian, Crispi put through liberal policies such as the Public Health Act of 1888 and establishing tribunals for redress against abuses by the government.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith (1997), p128)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Culture and society ====
Italian society after unification and throughout most of the Liberal Period was sharply divided along class, linguistic, regional, and social lines.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Martin. “Modern Italy: 1871–1982.” ''Longman History of Italy.'' London and New York: Longman. Pp. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Common cultural traits in Italy in this time were [[Social conservatism|social conservative]] in nature, including a strong belief in the family as an institution and [[patriarchal]] values.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 33&lt;/ref&gt; In other areas, Italian culture was divided. [[Aristocracy (class)|Aristocratic]], [[Nobility of Italy|noble]], and [[upper middle class]] families in Italy at this time were highly traditional in nature, with the upper middle-class even being known to often settle differences between each other by duels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark&quot;&gt;Clark, pp. 29&lt;/ref&gt; After unification, a number of descendents of former royal nobility became residents of Italy, numbering at 7,387 nobile families upon unification.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark&quot;/&gt; Many of Italy's elites were wealthy landowners who maintained a [[feudal society]] in regards to their agricultural system's utilization of large numbers of peasants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark&quot;/&gt; Italian society in this period remained highly divided along regional and local sub-societies which often had historical rivalries with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon unifying, Italy effectively did not have a single national language; Tuscan (which would be then known as Italian) was only used in [[Florence]] while outside, regional languages were dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Even the kingdom's first king, [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]] was known to speak almost entirely in [[Piedmontese]] and [[French language|French]], even to his cabinet ministers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark_2&quot;&gt;Clark, pp. 35&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, literacy was extremely poor in this era with an 1871 census indicating that 61.9 percent Italian men were illiterate and 75.7 percent of women were illiterate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark_3&quot;&gt;Clark, Pp. 35&lt;/ref&gt; This illiteracy rate was far higher than that of western European countries in the same time period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark_2&quot;/&gt; Some historians have claimed that census at this time for literacy were very lax as they only rated whether someone could write their own name and read a single passage, which may indicate that literacy in Italy was worse than what census projected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark_3&quot;/&gt; The level of illiteracy was compounded by the fact that Italy had very few public schools upon unification and no popular press was available across Italy due to the language division of the regional dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian government in the Liberal Period attempted to reduce illiteracy by establishing state-funded schools to teach the official Italian language.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Literacy and illiteracy variated in levels in the different regions of Italy where there were different levels of quality of public education, with the worst being in Southern Italy at the time which received minimal funding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark_3&quot;/&gt;

Living standards were low during the Liberal Period, especially in southern Italy due to various diseases such as [[malaria]] and epidemics that occurred during the period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark_4&quot;&gt;Clark. Pp. 14&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, there was initially a high death rate in 1871 at 30 people dying per 1000 people, though this reduced to 24.2 per 1000 by the 1890s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark_5&quot;&gt;Clark, pp. 31&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the mortality rate of children dying in their first year after birth in 1871 was 22.7 percent while the number of children dying before reaching their fifth birthday was very high at 50 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark_5&quot;/&gt; The mortality rate of children dying in their first year after birth decreased to an average of 17.6 percent in the time period of 1891 to 1900.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark_5&quot;/&gt;

==== Economy ====
With unification, the new kingdom faced serious economic problems and economic division along political, social, and regional lines. In the Liberal Period, Italy remained highly economically dependent on foreign trade and the international price of coal and grain.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Pp. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon unifying, Italy had a predominantly agrarian society as 60 percent of the active population worked in agriculture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark_6&quot;&gt;Clark. Pp. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Advances in technology, the sale of vast Church estates, foreign competition along with export opportunities rapidly transformed the agricultural sector in Italy shortly after unification .&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark_6&quot;/&gt; However these developments did not benefit all of Italy in this period, as southern Italy’s agriculture suffered from hot summers and aridity damaged crops while the presence of [[malaria]] prevented cultivation of low-lying areas along Italy’s [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark_4&quot;/&gt;

The overwhelming attention paid to foreign policy alienated the agricultural community in Italy which had been in decline since 1873.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith (1997), p138)&lt;/ref&gt; Both radical and conservative forces in the Italian parliament demanded that the government investigate how to improve agriculture in Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref7&quot;&gt;(Smith (1997), p136)&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation which started in 1877 and was released eight years later, showed that agriculture was not improving, that landowners were earning revenue from their lands and contributing almost nothing to the development of the land. Lower class Italians were hurt by the break-up of communal lands to the benefit of landlords.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref7&quot;/&gt; Most of the workers on the agricultural lands were not [[peasant]]s but short-term labourers (&quot;''braccianti''&quot;) who at best were employed for one year.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref7&quot;/&gt; Peasants without stable income were forced to live off meager food supplies, disease was spreading rapidly, plagues were reported, including a major [[cholera]] epidemic which killed at least 55,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith (1997), p137)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian government could not deal with the situation effectively because of overspending by the [[Agostino Depretis|Depretis]] government that left Italy heavily in debt. Italy also suffered economically as a consequence of overproduction of grapes by their vineyards. In the 1870s and 1880s, [[History of French wine|France's vineyard industry]] was suffering from vine disease caused by insects. Italy prospered as [[Italian wine|the largest exporter of wine]] in Europe. But following the recovery of France in 1888, southern Italy was overproducing and had to cut back, which caused greater unemployment and bankruptcies.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith (1997), p139)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian government invested heavily in developing railways in the 1870s, more than doubling the existing length of [[History of railways in Italy|railway line]] between 1870 and 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Clark. Pp. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy’s population remained severely divided between wealthy elites and impoverished workers especially on regional lines. An 1881 census found that over 1 million southern day-labourers were chronically under-employed and were very likely to become seasonal emigrants in order to economically sustain themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark_7&quot;&gt;Clark. Pp. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Southern peasants as well as small landowners and tenants often were in a state of conflict and revolt throughout the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Clark. Pp. 16&lt;/ref&gt; There were exceptions to the generally poor economic condition of agricultural workers of the south, as some regions near cities such as [[Naples]] and [[Palermo]] as well as along the Tyrrhenian coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark_7&quot;/&gt; The ''1910 Commission of Inquiry into the South'' indicated that the Italian government thus far had failed to ameliorate the severe economic differences and the limitation of voting rights only to those with sufficient property allowed rich landowners to exploit the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Clark. Pp. 17 –18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Francesco Crispi and the rise of Italian colonialism ====
{{Main|Italian Colonial Empire|Boxer Protocol|Treaty of Addis Ababa}}

[[Image:Francesco Crispi.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Francesco Crispi]] promoted the Italian colonialism in Africa in the late 19th century, but the humiliating defeat of [[Battle of Adwa|Adwa]] brought about his resignation.]]

A number of colonial projects were undertaken by the government. These were done to gain support of Italian nationalists and imperialists, who wanted to rebuild a Roman Empire. Already, Italy had large settlements in [[Alexandria]], [[Cairo]], and [[Tunis]]. Italy first attempted to gain colonies through negotiations with other world powers to make colonial concessions. These negotiations failed. Italy also sent missionaries to uncolonized lands to investigate the potential for Italian colonization. The most promising and realistic of these were parts of [[Africa]]. Italian missionaries had already established a foothold at [[Massawa]] (in present day [[Eritrea]]) in the 1830s and had entered deep into the [[Ethiopian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;(Smith (1997), pp115–117)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 February 1885, shortly after the fall of [[History of Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty|Egyptian rule]] in [[Khartoum]], Italy landed soldiers at Massawa. In 1888, Italy annexed Massawa by force, creating the colony of Italian Eritrea.

In 1895, Ethiopia led by Emperor [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelik II]] abandoned an agreement signed in 1889 to follow Italian foreign policy. Italy used this renunciation as a reason to invade Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;(Barclay (1997), p34)&lt;/ref&gt; Ethiopia gained the help of the [[Russian Empire]], whose own interests in [[East Africa]] led the government of [[Nicholas II of Russia]] to sent large amounts of modern weaponry to the Ethiopians to [[First Italo-Ethiopian War|hold back an Italian invasion]]. In response, Britain decided to back the Italians to challenge Russian influence in Africa and declared that all of Ethiopia was within the sphere of Italian interest. On the verge of war, Italian militarism and nationalism reached a peak, with Italians flocking to the [[Royal Italian Army]], hoping to take part in the upcoming war.&lt;ref&gt;(Barclay (1973), p33–34)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian army failed on the battlefield and were overwhelmed by a huge Ethiopian army at the [[Battle of Adwa]]. Italy was forced to retreat into Eritrea.&lt;ref&gt;(Barclay (1973), p35)&lt;/ref&gt; The failed Ethiopian campaign was an international embarrassment to Italy.

[[Image:Italian mounted infantry in China 1900 HD-SN-99-01989.jpg|thumb|left|Italian mounted infantry in [[Qing Dynasty|China]] during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in 1900.]]

From November 2, 1899, to September 7, 1901, Italy participated as part of the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] forces during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in [[China]]. On September 7, 1901, a concession in [[Tianjin|Tientsin]] was ceded to the Italy by the [[Qing Dynasty]]. On June 7, 1902, the concession was taken into Italian possession and administered by an Italian [[Consul (representative)|consul]].

In 1911, Italy declared war on the [[Ottoman Empire]] and invaded [[Tripolitania]], [[Fezzan]], and [[Cyrenaica]]. These provinces together formed what became known as [[Italian Libya|Libya]]. The war ended only a year later, but the occupation resulted in acts of discrimination against Libyans such as the forced deportation of Libyans to the [[Tremiti Islands]] in October 1911. By 1912, a third of these Libyan refugees had died from a lack of food and shelter.&lt;ref&gt;(Bosworth, RJB (2005) ''Mussolini's Italy'', New Work: Allen Lane, ISBN 0-7139-9697-8, p50)&lt;/ref&gt; The annexation of Libya led nationalists to advocate Italy's domination of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] by occupying the [[Kingdom of Greece]] and the Adriatic coastal region of [[Dalmatia]].&lt;ref&gt;(Bosworth (2005), p49)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Giovanni Giolitti ====
[[Image:Giolitti2.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Giovanni Giolitti]] was [[Prime Minister of Italy]] five times between 1892 and 1921.]]
In 1892, [[Giovanni Giolitti]] became Prime Minister of Italy for his first term. Although his first government quickly collapsed a year later, Giolitti returned in 1903 to lead Italy's government during a fragmented period that lasted until 1914. Giolitti had spent his earlier life as a civil servant, and then took positions within the cabinets of Crispi. Giolitti was the first long-term Italian Prime Minister in many years because he mastered the political concept of ''[[trasformismo]]'' by manipulating, coercing and bribing officials to his side. In elections during Giolitti's government, voting fraud was common, and Giolitti helped improve voting only in well-off, more supportive areas, while attempting to isolate and intimidate poor areas where opposition was strong.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, Dennis Mack (1997) ''Modern Italy; A Political History'', Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, ISBN 0-472-10895-6, p199)&lt;/ref&gt; Southern Italy was in terrible shape prior to and during Giolitti's tenure as Prime Minister. Four-fifths of southern Italians were illiterate and the dire situation there ranged from problems of large numbers of absentee landlords to rebellion and even starvation.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith (1997), p209–210)&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption was such a large problem that Giolitti himself admitted that there were places &quot;where the law does not operate at all&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith (1997), p199)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, Giolitti's government sent forces to occupy Libya. While the success of the Libyan War improved the status of the nationalists, it did not help Giolitti's administration as a whole. The government attempted to discourage criticism by speaking about Italy's strategic achievements and inventiveness of their military in the war: Italy was the first country to use the [[airship]] for military purposes, and undertook [[strategic bombing|aerial bombing]] on the Ottoman forces.&lt;ref&gt;(Bosworth, Richard. (1983). ''Italy and the Approach of the First World War''. London: The Macmillan Press Ltd, p42)&lt;/ref&gt; The war radicalized the [[Italian Socialist Party]]: anti-war revolutionaries led by future-Fascist dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] called for violence to bring down the government. Giolitti returned as Prime Minister only briefly in 1920, but the era of liberalism was effectively over in Italy.

The [[Italian general election, 1913|1913]] and [[Italian general election, 1919|1919]] elections saw gains made by Socialist, Catholic and nationalist parties at the expense of the traditionally dominant liberals and [[Italian Radicals (disambiguation)|radicals]], who were increasingly fractured and weakened as a result.

=== World War I and the failure of liberal state (1915–1922) ===
==== Prelude to war, internal dilemma ====
In the lead-up to the [[World War I]], the Kingdom of Italy faced a number of short-term and long-term problems in determining its allies and objectives. Italy's recent success in occupying [[Libya]] as a result of the [[Italo-Turkish War]] had sparked tension with its [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] allies, the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], because both countries had been seeking closer relations with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turkish Empire. In Munich, Germans reacted to Italy's aggression by singing anti-Italian songs.&lt;ref&gt;(Bosworth (1983), pp99–100)&lt;/ref&gt; Italy's relations with the [[French Third Republic]] also were in bad shape: France felt betrayed by Italy’s support of Prussia in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], opening the possibility of war erupting between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;(Bosworth (1983), p101)&lt;/ref&gt; Italy's relations with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] had also been impaired by constant Italian demands for more recognition in the international stage following the occupation of Libya, and its demands that other nations accept its spheres of influence in East Africa and the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;(Bosworth (1983), p112)&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Image:Italian empire 1914.png|thumb|350px|right|Italy and its colonial possessions at the time of the outbreak of [[World War I]]. The area between British Egypt and the firmly held Italian territories is the region of southern [[Cyrenaica]] which was under dispute of ownership between Italy and the [[United Kingdom]].]] In the Mediterranean, Italy’s relations with the [[Kingdom of Greece]] were aggravated when Italy occupied the Greek-populated [[Dodecanese]] Islands, including [[Rhodes]], from 1912 to 1914. These islands had been formerly controlled by the Ottoman Empire. Italy and Greece were also in open rivalry over the desire to occupy [[Albania]].&lt;ref&gt;(Bosworth (1983), pp112–114)&lt;/ref&gt; King Emmanuel III himself was uneasy about Italy pursuing distant colonial adventures, and said that Italy should prepare to take back Italian-populated land from [[Austria-Hungary]], as the &quot;completion of the Risorgimento&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;(Bosworth (1983), p119)&lt;/ref&gt; This idea put Italy at odds with Austria-Hungary.

A major hindrance to Italy's decision on what to do about the war was the political instability throughout Italy in 1914. After the formation of the government of Prime Minister [[Antonio Salandra]] in March 1914, the government attempted to win the support of nationalists and moved to the political right.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref9&quot;&gt;(Clark, 1984. p.180)&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the left became more repulsed by the government after the killing of three anti-militarist demonstrators in June.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref9&quot;/&gt; Many elements of the left including [[syndicalists]], [[republicanism|republicans]] and [[anarchists]] protested against this and the [[Italian Socialist Party]] declared a [[general strike]] in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;(Clark, Martin. 1984. ''Modern Italy: 1871-1982.'' London and New York: Longman Group UK Limited. p.180)&lt;/ref&gt; The protests that ensued became known as &quot;[[Red Week]]&quot; as leftists rioted and various acts of civil disobedience occurred in major cities and small towns such as seizing  railway stations, cutting telephone wires, and burning tax-registers.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref9&quot;/&gt; However only two days later the strike was officially called off, though the civil strife continued. Militarist nationalists and anti-militarist leftists fought on the streets until the [[Italian Royal Army]] forcefully restored calm after having used thousands of men to put down the various protesting forces&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref9&quot;/&gt; following the invasion of [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] by Austria-Hungary in 1914, World War I broke out. Despite Italy's official alliance to the German Empire and in the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]], she initially remained neutral, claiming that the Triple Alliance was only for defensive purposes.

[[Image:Gabriele D'Annunzio.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Gabriele d'Annunzio]], a prominent nationalist revolutionary who was a supporter of Italy joining action in the [[First World War]].]]
In Italy, society was divided over the war: Italian socialists generally opposed the war and supported pacificism, while nationalists militantly supported the war. Long-time nationalists [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] and [[Luigi Federzoni]] and an obscure Marxist journalist and new convert to nationalist sentiment, future Fascist dictator [[Benito Mussolini]], demanded that Italy join the war. For nationalists, Italy had to maintain its alliance with the [[Central Empires]], in order to obtain colonial territories in expenses of France. For the liberals, the war presented Italy a long-awaited opportunity to use an alliance with the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] to gain certain Italian-populated and other territories from Austria-Hungary, which had long been part of Italian patriotic aims since unification. In 1915, relatives of Italian revolutionary and republican hero [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] died on the battlefield of France, where they had volunteered to fight. Federzoni used the memorial services to declare the importance of Italy joining the war, and to warn the monarchy of the consequences of continued disunity in Italy if it did not:
{{Quotation|Italy has awaited this since 1866 her truly national war, in order to feel unified at last, renewed by the unanimous action and identical sacrifice of all her sons. Today, while Italy still wavers before the necessity imposed by history, the name of Garibaldi, resanctified by blood, rises again to warn her that she will not be able to defeat the revolution save by fighting and winning her national war.&quot; ''Luigi Federzoni, 1915''&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref10&quot;&gt;(Thayer, John A. (1964). ''Italy and the Great War.'' Madison and Milwaukee: University of Wisconsin Press. p279)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Mussolini used his new newspaper ''[[Il Popolo d'Italia]]'' and his strong oratorical skills to urge nationalists and patriotic revolutionary leftists to support Italy's entry into the war to gain back Italian populated territories from Austria-Hungary, by saying &quot;enough of [[Italian North Africa|Libya]], and on to [[Trento|Trent]] and [[Trieste]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref10&quot;/&gt; Mussolini claimed that it was in the interests of socialists to join the war to tear down the aristocratic [[Hohenzollern]] dynasty of Germany which he claimed was the enemy of all European workers.&lt;ref&gt;(Thayer, p272)&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini and other nationalists warned the Italian government that Italy must join the war or face revolution and called for violence against pacifists and neutralists.&lt;ref&gt;(Thayer, p253)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Left-wing nationalism]] also erupted in southern Italy, socialist and nationalist [[Giuseppe De Felice Giuffrida]] saw joining the war as essential to relieving southern Italy of the rising cost of bread which had caused riots in the south, and advocated a &quot;war of revolution&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;(Thayer, p254)&lt;/ref&gt;

With nationalist sentiment firmly on the side of reclaiming Italian territories of Austria-Hungary, Italy entered negotiations with the Triple Entente. The negotiations ended successfully in April 1915 when the [[London Pact]] was brokered with the Italian government. The pact ensured Italy the right to attain all Italian-populated lands it wanted from Austria-Hungary, and even land in the [[Balkans]] and [[German colonial empire|German colonies]] in Africa{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}. The proposal fulfilled the desires of Italian nationalists and Italian imperialism, and was agreed to. Italy joined the Triple Entente in its war against Austria-Hungary.

The reaction in Italy was divided: former Prime Minister [[Giovanni Giolitti]] was furious over Italy's decision to go to war against its former defence allies Austria-Hungary. He claimed that Italy would fail in the war, predicting high numbers of mutinies, Austro-Hungarian occupation of more Italian territory, and that the failure would produce a catastrophic rebellion that would destroy the liberal-democratic monarchy and the liberal-democratic secular institutions of the state.&lt;ref&gt;(Clark, Martin. 1984. ''Modern Italy: 1871-1982.'' London and New York: Longman Group UK Limited. p.184)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Italy's war effort ====
[[Image:Luigi Cadorna.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Generalissimo]]'' [[Luigi Cadorna]], (the man to the left of two officers to whom he is speaking) while visiting British batteries during World War I.]]
The outset of the campaign against Austria-Hungary looked initially to favour Italy: Austria-Hungary's army was spread to cover its fronts with [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]], and Italy had a numerical superiority against the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. However, this advantage was never fully utilized because Italian military commander [[Luigi Cadorna]] insisted on a dangerous frontal assault against Austria-Hungary in an attempt to occupy the Slovenian plateau and [[Ljubljana]]. This assault would put the Italian army not far away from Austria-Hungary's imperial capital, [[Vienna]]. After eleven failed offensives with enormous loss of life, the Italian campaign to take Vienna collapsed.

Upon entering the war, geography was also a difficulty for Italy, as its border with Austria-Hungary was along mountainous terrain. In May 1915, Italian forces at 400,000 men along the border outnumbered the Austrian and Germans almost precisely four to one.&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, Christopher. 1967. ''Italy from Liberalism to Fascism: 1870 to 1925.'' London: Methuen &amp; Co. Ltd. Pp. 451&lt;/ref&gt; However the Austrian defenses were strong even though they were undermanned and managed to hold off the Italian offensive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seton&quot;&gt;Seton-Watson, Pp. 451&lt;/ref&gt; The battles with the Austro-Hungarian Army along the Alpine foothills in the trench warfare there were drawn-out, long engagements with little progress.&lt;ref&gt;(Clark, Martin. 1984. ''Modern Italy: 1871-1982.'' London and New York: Longman Group UK Limited. p.185)&lt;/ref&gt; Italian officers were poorly trained in contrast to the Austro-Hungarian and [[German Army (German Empire)|German]] armies, Italian artillery was inferior to the Austrian machine guns and the Italian forces had dangerously low supply of ammunition, this shortage would continually hamper attempts to make advances into Austrian territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seton&quot;/&gt; This combined with the constant replacement of officers by Cadorna resulted in few officers gaining the experience necessary to lead military missions.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref12&quot;&gt;(Clark, 1984. p.186)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the first year of the war, poor conditions on the battlefield led to outbreaks of cholera causing a significant number of Italian soldiers to die.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seton_2&quot;&gt;Seton-Watson, Pp. 452&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these serious problems, Cadorna refused to back down the offensive. Naval battles occurred between the Italian Royal Navy (''[[Regia Marina]]'') and the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]]. Italy's warships were outclassed by the Austro-Hungarian fleet and the situation was made more dire for Italy in that both the [[French Navy]] and the (British) [[Royal Navy]] were not sent into the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Their respective governments viewed the Adriatic as far too dangerous to operate due the concentration of the Austro-Hungarian fleet there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seton_2&quot;/&gt; 

Morale fell among Italian soldiers who lived a tedious life when not on the front lines: they were forbidden to enter theatres or bars even when on leave. However when battles were about to occur, alcohol was made freely available to the soldiers in order to reduce tension before the battle.In order to escape the tedium after battles, some groups of soldiers worked to create improvised brothels.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref14&quot;&gt;(Clark, 1984. p.187)&lt;/ref&gt; In order to maintain morale, the Italian army had propaganda lectures of the importance of the war to Italy, especially in order to retrieve [[Trento]] and [[Trieste]] from Austria-Hungary.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref14&quot;/&gt; Some of these lectures were carried out by popular nationalist war proponents such as [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]]. D'Annunzio himself would participate in a number of paramilitary raids on Austrian positions along the Adriatic coastline during the war and lost an eye one of the battles.&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, Pp. 502&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent pro-war advocate [[Benito Mussolini]] was prevented from giving lecture by the government, most likely because of his revolutionary socialist past.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref14&quot;/&gt;

The Italian government became increasingly aggravated in 1915 with the passive nature of the [[Military history of Serbia|Serbian army]] which had not engaged in a serious offensive against Austria-Hungary for months.&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, Pp. 452-3&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian government blamed Serbian military inactiveness for allowing the Austrians to muster their armies against Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seton_3&quot;&gt;Seton-Watson, Pp. 453&lt;/ref&gt; Cadorna suspected that Serbia was attempting to negotiate an end to fighting with Austria and addressed this to foreign minister [[Sidney Sonnino]] who himself bitterly claimed that the Serbia was an unreliable ally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seton_3&quot;/&gt; Relations between Italy and Serbia became so cold that the other Entente members were forced to abandon the idea of forming a united Balkan front against Austria-Hungary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seton_3&quot;/&gt; In negotiations, Sonnino remained willing to allow [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] to join Serbia, but refused to discuss the fate of [[Dalmatia]] which was claimed by Italy and [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavists]] in Serbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seton_3&quot;/&gt; As Serbia fell to the Austro-Hungarian and German forces in 1915, Cadorna proposed sending 60,000 men to land in [[Thessaloniki]] to help the Serbs now in exile in Greece and the [[Principality of Albania]] to fight off the opposing forces, but the Italian government's bitterness to Serbia resulted in the proposal being rejected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seton_3&quot;/&gt;

After 1916, the situation for Italy grew steadily worse, the Austro-Hungarian army managed to push the Italian Army back into Italy as far as [[Verona]] and [[Padua]] in their Strafexpedition. At the same time Italy faced a shortage of warships, increased attacks by submarines, soaring freight charges threatening the ability to supply food to soldiers, lack of raw materials and equipment, and Italians faced high taxes to pay for the war.&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, Pp. 456&lt;/ref&gt; Austro-Hungarian and German forces had gone deep into northern Italian territory, and finally in November 1916, Cadorna ended offensive operations and began a defensive approach. In 1917, France, the United Kingdom and the [[United States]] offered to send troops to Italy to help it fend off the offensive of the [[Central Powers]], but the Italian government refused, as Sonnino did not want Italy to be seen as a [[client state]] of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and preferred isolation as the more brave alternative.&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, Pp. 461-2&lt;/ref&gt; Italy also wanted to keep the [[Kingdom of Greece]] out of the war, as the Italian government feared that should Greece join the war on the side of the Allies, it would intend to annex Albania, which Italy wanted as its own.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seton_4&quot;&gt;Seton-Watson, Pp. 463&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately for Italy, the [[Venizelism|Venizelist]] pro-war advocates in Greece failed to succeed in pressuring [[Constantine I of Greece]] to bring the country into the conflict, and Italian aims on Albania remained unthreatened.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seton_4&quot;/&gt;

 [[File:Italia-I-Guerra-Mondiale-fanti-classe-1888.jpg|thumb|right|Italian infantrymen in 1916. More than 650,000 Italian soldiers lost their lives on the battlefields of [[World War I]].]]

The [[Russian Empire]] collapsed in a 1917 [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], eventually resulting in the rise of the [[communist]] [[Bolshevik]] regime of [[Vladimir Lenin]]. The resulting marginalization of the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], allowed for more Austro-Hungarian and German forces arriving on the front against Italy. Internal dissent against the war grew with increasingly poor economic and social conditions in Italy due to the strain of the war. Much of the profit of the war was being made in the cities while rural areas were losing income.&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, Pp. 468-9&lt;/ref&gt; The number of men available for agricultural work had fallen from 4.8 million to 2.2 million, though through the help of women, agricultural production managed to be maintained at 90 percent of its pre-war total during the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seton_5&quot;&gt;Seton-Watson, Pp. 468&lt;/ref&gt; Many pacifist and internationalist Italian socialists turned to [[Bolshevism]] and advocated negotiations with the workers of Germany and Austria-Hungary to help end the war and bring about Bolshevik revolutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seton_5&quot;/&gt; The newspaper ''[[Avanti! (Italian newspaper)|Avanti!]]'' of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] declared &quot;Let the bourgeoisie fight its own war&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, Pp. 469&lt;/ref&gt; Leftist women in northern Italian cities led protests demanding action against the high cost of living and demanding an end to the war.&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, Pp. 470&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Milan]] in May 1917, communist revolutionaries organized and engaged in rioting calling for an end to the war, and managed to close down factories and stop public transportation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seton_6&quot;&gt;Seton-Watson, Pp. 471&lt;/ref&gt;  The Italian army was forced to enter [[Milan]] with tanks and machine guns to face communists and anarchists who fought violently until May 23 when the army gained control of the city with almost fifty people killed (three of which were Italian soldiers) and over 800 people arrested.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seton_6&quot;/&gt;

After the [[Battle of Caporetto]] in 1917, Italian forces were forced far back into Italian territory, and the humiliation led to the arrival of [[Vittorio Emanuele Orlando]] as Prime Minister who managed to solve some of Italy's wartime problems. Orlando abandoned the previous isolationist approach to the war and increased coordination with the Allies and the use of the convoy system to fend off submarine attack, allowed Italy to be able to end food shortages from February 1918 onward, and Italy received more raw materials from the Allies.&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, Pp. 486&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1918, began the official repression of enemy aliens and Italian socialists were increasingly repressed by the Italian government. The Italian government was infuriated with the [[Fourteen Points]] of [[Woodrow Wilson]], the [[List of Presidents of the United States|President of the United States]], as the advocation of national [[self-determination]] meant that Italy would not gain Dalmatia as had been promised in the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Seton_7&quot;&gt;Seton-Watson, Pp. 493&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Parliament of Italy]], nationalists condemned Wilson's fourteen points as betraying the Treaty of London, while socialists claimed that Wilson's points were valid and claimed the Treaty of London was an offense to the rights of [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], [[Greeks]], and [[Albanians]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Seton_7&quot;/&gt; Negotiations between Italy and the Allies, particularly the new Yugoslav delegation (replacing the Serbian delegation), agreed to a trade off between Italy and the new [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], which was that Dalmatia as claimed by Italy would be accepted as Yugoslav, while [[Istria]] as claimed by the Yugoslavs would be accepted as Italian.&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, Pp. 495&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Battle of the Piave River]] the Italian army managed to hold off the Austro-Hungarian and German armies. The opposing armies repeatedly failed afterwards in major battles such as [[Battle of Asiago]] and the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]]. The Italian Army crushed the Austrian offensive in the latter battle. Austria-Hungary ended the fighting against Italy with the armistice on 11 November 1918 which ended World War I.

During the war, the Italian Royal Army increased in size from 15,000 men in 1914 to 160,000 men in 1918, with 5 million recruits in total entering service during the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref12&quot;/&gt; This came at a terrible cost: by the end of the war, Italy had lost 700,000 soldiers and had a budget deficit of twelve billion lira. Italian society was divided between the majority pacifists who opposed Italian involvement in the war and the minority of pro-war nationalists who had condemned the Italian government for not having immediately gone to war with Austria in 1914.

==== Italy's territorial settlements and the reaction ====

As the war came to an end, [[Italian Prime Minister]] [[Vittorio Emanuele Orlando]] met with [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[David Lloyd George]], [[Prime Minister of France]] [[Georges Clemenceau]], and [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] in [[Versailles]], to discuss how the borders of [[Europe]] should be redefined to help avoid a future European war.

The talks provided little territorial gain to Italy because Wilson, during the peace talks, promised freedom to all European nationalities to form their own nation states. As a result, the [[Treaty of Versailles]] did not assign Dalmatia and Albania to Italy, as had been promised in the [[Treaty of London (1915)]]. Furthermore, the British and French decided to divide the German overseas colonies into mandates of their own, with Italy receiving none of them. Despite this, Orlando signed the Treaty of Versailles, which caused uproar against his government. Civil unrest erupted in Italy between nationalists who supported the war effort and opposed the &quot;mutilated victory&quot; (as nationalists called it) and leftists who were opposed to the war.

Furious over the peace settlement, Italian nationalist revolutionary [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] led nationalists to form the [[Free State of Fiume]] in September 1919. His popularity among nationalists led him to be called ''[[Il Duce]]'' (The Leader) and he used blackshirted paramilitary in his assault on Fiume, the leadership title of &quot;Duce&quot; and the blackshirt paramilitary uniform would later become synonymous with the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] movement of [[Benito Mussolini]]. The demand for annexation of Fiume spread to all sides of the political spectrum, including Mussolini's Fascists.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1997), p293&lt;/ref&gt; D'Annunzio’s stirring speeches drew Croatian nationalists to his side. He also kept contact with the [[Irish Republican Army]] and Egyptian nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth (2005), pp112–113.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rise of Fascism into power ====
{{refimprove section|date=March 2011}}
{{Main|Italian Fascism|Fascist and anti-Fascist violence in Italy (1919–26)}}
In 1914, [[Benito Mussolini]] was forced out of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] after calling for Italian intervention against Austria. Prior to World War I, Mussolini had opposed military conscription, protested Italy's occupation of Libya, and was the editor of the Socialist Party's official newspaper, ''[[Avanti! (Italian newspaper)|Avanti!]]''. Over time, he simply called for revolution, without mentioning class struggle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;Smith (1997), p284&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini's nationalism enabled him to raise funds from [[Italian Ansaldo company|Ansaldo]] (an armaments firm) and other companies to create his own newspaper ''[[Il Popolo d'Italia]]'' to convince socialists and revolutionaries to support the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;/&gt; France, Britain, and Russia, wanting to draw Italy to the Entente, helped finance the newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Martin. ''Modern Italy:1871-1982''. London and New York: Longman Group UK Limited. p.183&lt;/ref&gt; This newspaper became Fascist Italy's officially-supported newspaper years later. During the war, Mussolini served in the Italian army and was wounded once during the war. The wound is widely believed to be the result of an accident in grenade practice, although he claimed to have been wounded in battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:Mussd.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] [[Blackshirts]] in 1920]]

Following the end of the war and the Treaty of Versailles, in 1919, Mussolini created the ''[[Fasci di Combattimento]]'' or Combat League. It was originally dominated by patriotic socialist and [[syndicalist]] veterans who opposed the [[pacifism|pacifist]] nature of the Italian Socialist Party. The Fascists initially had a platform far more inclined to the left, promising social revolution, proportional representation, women's suffrage (partly realized in 1925), and dividing private property held by estates.&lt;ref&gt;Passmore ''Women, Gender and Fascism'', p. 11-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1997), pp284–286)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 April 1919, the Fascists made their debut in political violence, when a group of members from the ''Fasci di Combattimento'' attacked the offices of ''Avanti!'' Recognizing the failures of the Fascists' initial revolutionary and left-leaning policy, Mussolini moved the organization away from the left and turned the revolutionary movement into an electoral movement in 1921 named the ''Partito Nazionale Fascista'' ([[National Fascist Party]]). The party copied the nationalist themes of D'Annunzio and rejected parliamentary democracy while still operating within to destroy it. Mussolini changed his original revolutionary policies, such as moving away from anti-clericalism to supporting the Catholic Church and abandoned his public opposition to the monarchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith_2&quot;&gt;Smith (1997), p298&lt;/ref&gt; Fascist support and violence began to grow in 1921 and Fascist-supporting army officers began taking arms and vehicles from the army to use in counterrevolutionary attacks on socialists.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1997), p302&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, Giolitti had come back as Prime Minister in an attempt to solve Italy's deadlock. One year later, Giolitti's government had already become unstable, and a growing socialist opposition further endangered his government. Giolitti believed that the Fascists could be toned down and used to protect the state from the socialists. He decided to include Fascists on his electoral list for the 1921 elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith_2&quot;/&gt; In the elections, the Fascists did not make large gains, but Giolitti's government failed to gather a large enough coalition to govern and offered the Fascists placements in his government. The Fascists rejected Giolitti's offers and joined with socialists in bringing down his government.&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth (2005), p112&lt;/ref&gt; A number of descendants of those who had served Garibaldi's revolutionaries during unification were won over to Mussolini's nationalist revolutionary ideals.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith (1997), p312&lt;/ref&gt; His advocacy of [[corporatism]] and [[futurism]] had attracted advocates of the &quot;third way&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1997), p312&lt;/ref&gt; But most importantly he had won over politicians in Italy like Facta and Giolitti who did not condemn him for his Blackshirts' mistreatment of socialists.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1997), p315&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1922, Mussolini took advantage of a general strike by workers in Italy, and announced his demands to the Italian government to give the Fascist Party political power or face a coup. With no immediate response, a small number of Fascists began a long trek across Italy to Rome which was called the [[March on Rome]], claiming to Italians that Fascists were intending to restore law and order. Mussolini himself did not participate until the very end of the march, with d'Annunzio at being hailed as leader of the march until it was learned he had been pushed out of a window and severely wounded in a failed [[assassination]] attempt, depriving him of the possibility of leading an actual coup d'état orchestrated by an organization originally founded by himself. The Fascists, under the leadership of Mussolini demanded Prime Minister [[Luigi Facta]]'s resignation and that Mussolini be named Prime Minister. Although the Italian Army was far better armed than the Fascist paramilitaries, the Italian government under King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] faced a political crisis. The King was forced to choose which of the two rival movements in Italy would form the government: Mussolini's Fascists, or the anti-monarchist [[Italian Socialist Party]]. He selected the Fascists.

[[Image:Benito Mussolini Roman Salute.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Mussolini was initially a highly popular leader in Italy until Italy's military failures in World War II. Here Mussolini salutes to crowds of thousands of people.]]

On October 28, 1922, Victor Emmanuel III selected Mussolini to become Italian Prime Minister, allowing Mussolini and the Fascist Party to pursue their political ambitions as long as they supported the monarchy and its interests. Mussolini was a very young political leader (at the age of 39) compared to other Italian prime ministers and world leaders at the time. Mussolini was called ''Il Duce'', or &quot;The Leader&quot; by his supporters, an unofficial title that was commonly used to describe Mussolini's position during the Fascist era. A personality cult was developed that portrayed him as the nation's saviour which was aided by the personal popularity he held with Italians already which would remain strong until Italy faced continuous military defeats in [[World War II]].

Upon taking power, Mussolini formed a legislative coalition with nationalists, liberals, and populists. However goodwill by the Fascists towards parliamentary democracy faded quickly: Mussolini's coalition passed the electoral [[Acerbo Law]] of 1923, which gave two thirds of the seats in parliament to the party or coalition that achieved 25% of the vote. The Fascist Party used violence and intimidation to achieve the 25% threshold in the 1924 election, and became the ruling political party of Italy.

Following the election, Socialist deputy [[Giacomo Matteotti]] was assassinated after calling for an annulment of the elections because of the irregularities. Following the assassination, the Socialists walked out of parliament, allowing Mussolini to pass more authoritarian laws. In 1925, Mussolini accepted responsibility for the Fascist violence in 1924, and promised that dissenters would be dealt with harshly.  Before the speech, Blackshirts smashed opposition presses and beat up several of Mussolini's opponents.  This event is considered the onset of undisguised Fascist dictatorship in Italy, though it would be 1928 before the Fascist Party was formally declared the only legal party in the nation.

Over the next four years, Mussolini eliminated nearly all checks and balances on his power.  In 1926, he passed a law that declared he was responsible only to the king and made him the sole person able to determine Parliament's agenda.  Local autonomy was swept away, and appointed podestas replaced communal mayors and councils.  Soon after all other parties were banned in 1928, parliamentary elections were replaced by plebiscites in which the Grand Council nominated a single list of candidates.  

The result of Mussolini's takeover of the government was the creation of a [[diarchy]] in Italy, with Mussolini wielding enormous political powers as the effective ruler of Italy, while the King remained a figurehead.  He did, however, still have the right to dismiss the prime minister, albeit only on the advice of the Grand Council—at least in theory, the only check on Mussolini's power.

==== Culture and society ====
[[Image:Fascist Propaganda Italy 1933.gif|thumb|250px|right|Fascist [[propaganda]] depicting a number of slogans and themes of the Fascist regime. The popular Fascist  [[Militarism|militarist]] slogan &quot;Book and Musket make the Perfect Fascist&quot; is displayed. The connection of a [[crucifix]] to the [[fasces]] represents the link the Fascists promoted after 1929 of Christianity being naturally connected to Fascism. ''Anno XI E.F.'' refers to the period of eleven years since Mussolini rose to power as of the time of the creation of this propaganda piece in 1933.]]

After rising to power, the Fascist regime set Italy on a course to becoming a one-party state and to integrate Fascism into all aspects of life. A [[totalitarian]] state as was officially declared in the ''[[Doctrine of Fascism]]'' of 1935,

{{Quotation|The Fascist conception of the State is all-embracing; outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist, much less have value. Thus understood, Fascism is totalitarian, and the Fascist State—a synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values—interprets, develops, and potentiates the whole life of a people. ''Doctrine of Fascism, 1935.''&lt;ref&gt;Mussolini, Benito. 1935. Fascism: Doctrine and Institutions. Rome: Ardita Publishers. p 14.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With the concept of totalitarianism, Mussolini and the Fascist regime set an agenda of improving Italian culture and society based on ancient Rome, personal dictatorship, and some futurist aspects of Italian intellectuals and artists.&lt;ref&gt;Pauley, Bruce F (2003) ''Hitler, Stalin, and Mussolini: Totalitarianism in the Twentieth Century Italy'', Wheeling: Harlan Davidson, Inc., p107&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Fascism, the definition of the Italian nationality rested on a [[Militarism|militarist]] foundation and the Fascist's &quot;new man&quot; ideal in which loyal Italians would rid themselves of [[individualism]] and autonomy and see themselves as a component of the Italian state and be willing to sacrifice their lives for it.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, Emilio. ''The Struggle For Modernity Nationalism Futurism and Fascism'' (Westport, CT: Praeger, 2003), p87.&lt;/ref&gt; Under such a totalitarian society, only Fascists would be considered &quot;true Italians&quot; and membership and endorsement of the Fascist Party was necessary for people to gain &quot;Complete Citizenship&quot;, those who did not swear allegiance to Fascism were banished from public life and could not gain employment.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, p81.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fascist regime also reached out to Italian [[expatriate]]s living abroad to endorse the Fascist cause and identify with Italy rather than their place of residence.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, p146.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite efforts to mould a new culture for fascism, Fascist Italy's efforts were not as drastic or successful in comparison to other one-party states like [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] in creating a new culture.&lt;ref&gt;Pauley, p108&lt;/ref&gt;

In Fascist Italy, Mussolini was idolized as the nation's saviour. In public and in [[Propaganda of Fascist Italy|propaganda]] the Fascist regime attempted to make him omnipresent in Italian society. Much of Fascism's appeal in Italy was based on the personality cult around Mussolini and his popularity. Mussolini's passionate oratory and personality cult was displayed at huge rallies and parades of his Blackshirts in Rome which served as an inspiration to [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers Party]] in Germany.

The Fascist regime established propaganda in newsreels, radio broadcasting, and a few feature films deliberately endorsing Fascism. In 1926, laws were passed to require that propaganda newsreels be shown prior to all feature films in cinemas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pauley&quot;&gt;Pauley, p109&lt;/ref&gt; These newsreels were more effective in influencing the Italian public than propaganda films or radio, as few Italians had radio receivers at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pauley&quot;/&gt; Fascist propaganda was widely present in posters and state-sponsored art of the time. Art and literature in Fascist Italy were not strictly controlled, and were only censored if they were blatantly against the state.

Relations with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] improved significantly during Mussolini's regime. Despite earlier opposition to the Church, after 1922, Mussolini made an alliance with the pro-church ''[[Partito Popolare Italiano]]'' or Italian People's Party. Mussolini negotiated with the Pope over granting sovereignty to the territory of the Vatican as part of a &quot;''conciliazione''&quot; (conciliation) in a concordat called the [[Lateran Treaty]] to improve Italy's official relations with the Church. The negotiations however were initially tense: the Vatican and the Fascist regime engaged in bitter arguments over what such a pact would mean and how it should be interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, John F. (1985). ''The Vatican and Italian Fascism, 1929-32.'' Cambridge, USA: Cambridge University Press. p53&lt;/ref&gt; Giovanni Montini (the future [[Pope Paul VI]]), who was involved with pro-Catholic politics in Italy, questioned the value of the concordat in ensuring Vatican sovereignty, once saying &quot;If the liberty of the Pope cannot be guaranteed by the strong faith of a free people, and especially by the Italian people, then no territory and no treaty will be able to do so.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, p54&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:VaticanCity Annex.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Territory of [[Vatican City]], established by  the [[Lateran Treaty]].]]

The Fascist regime nevertheless proceeded with its intent to resolve the problem of Vatican sovereignty. A plebiscite was held in March 1929 in which Italians were asked to vote on the government's proposed recognition of Vatican sovereignty. Those who opposed the concordat felt intimidated by the Fascist regime: the [[Azione Cattolica|Catholic Action]] party (''Azione Cattolica'') instructed Italian Catholics to vote for Fascist candidates to represent them in positions in churches, Mussolini claimed that &quot;no&quot; votes were of those &quot;...few ill-advised anti-clericals who refuse to accept the Lateran Pacts&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, p49&lt;/ref&gt; In the French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'', [[Guido Miglioni]] spoke of the attitude of the Fascist regime and what he saw was the nature of the Lateran pact: &quot;These two years have witnessed the gradual but inexorable submission of the Pope to the demands of the Regime&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollard&quot;&gt;Pollard, p55&lt;/ref&gt; Despite opposition to the nature of the negotiations, many Italians feared that a &quot;no&quot; vote would incite Fascist reprisals and attacks on the individuals who opposed the concordat. When the plebiscite was held, 8.63 million Italians or 90 per cent of the registered electorate voted.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, p61&lt;/ref&gt; Of this number, only 135,761 voted &quot;no&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollard&quot;/&gt; The Lateran Treaty was signed and the Vatican's sovereignty was recognized. Despite earlier troubles, relations between the Church and the regime and moreover Italy itself, improved significantly. The Lateran Treaty remains in place to this day.
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:ItaloFlight.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Poster for [[Italo Balbo]]'s transatlantic flight to the [[Century of Progress]] in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]].]] --&gt;

In 1933, Italy made multiple technological achievements. The Fascist government spent large sums of money on technological projects such as the construction of the new Italian ocean liner [[SS Rex]] which in 1933 made a transatlantic sea crossing record of four days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greatoceanliners.net/rex.html greatoceanliners.net - rex]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as funding the development of the [[Macchi M.C.72]] [[seaplane]] which became the world's fastest seaplane in 1933 and retained the title in 1934. In 1933, Fascist government member [[Italo Balbo]], who was also an aviator made a transatlantic flight in a flying boat to Chicago for the [[World's Fair]] called the [[Century of Progress]]. The flight symbolized the power of Fascist leadership and the industrial and technological progress the state had made under Fascist direction.

On the issue of anti-Semitism, the Fascists were divided on what to do, especially with the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] in Germany. A number of Fascist members were Jewish, and Mussolini himself did not personally believe in anti-Semitism, but to appease Hitler, anti-Semitism within the Fascist party steadily increased. In 1936, Mussolini made his first written denounciation of Jews by claiming that anti-Semitism had only arisen because Jews had become too predominant in the positions of power of countries and claimed that Jews were a &quot;ferocious&quot; tribe who sought to &quot;totally banish&quot; Christians from public life.&lt;ref&gt;Sarti, p199.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, Fascist member [[Paolo Orano]] criticized the [[Zionist]] movement as being part of British foreign policy which designed to secure British hold of the area without respecting the Christian and Muslim presence in [[Palestine]]. On the matter of Jewish Italians, Orano said that they &quot;should concern themselves with nothing more than their religion&quot; and not bother boasting of being patriotic Italians.&lt;ref&gt;Sarti, p200.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, under pressure from Nazi Germany, Mussolini made the regime adopt a policy of [[anti-Semitism]], which was extremely unpopular in Italy and in the Fascist Party itself.  As a result of the laws, the Fascist regime lost its propaganda director, [[Margherita Sarfatti]], who was Jewish and had been Mussolini's mistress. A minority of high-ranking Fascists were pleased with anti-Semitic policy such as [[Roberto Farinacci]] who claimed that Jews through intrigue had taken control key positions of finance, business and schools and he noted that Jews sympathized with Ethiopia during Italy's war with it and that Jews had sympathized with [[Republican Spain]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarti, p198.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, Farinacci became the minister in charge of culture, and adopted racial laws designed to prevent racial intermixing which included anti-Semitism. Until the armistice with the Allies in September 1943, the Italian Jewish community was protected from deportation to the Nazi death camps in the east. With the armistice, Hitler took control of the German occupied territory in the north and began an effort to liquidate the Jewish community under his control. Shortly after the entry of Italy into the war, numerous camps were established for the imprisonment of enemy aliens and Italians suspected to be hostile to the regime. In contrast to the brutality of the Nazi-run camps, the Italian camps allowed families to live together and there was a broad program of social welfare and cultural activities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/italy_main.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Education ====
The Fascist government endorsed a stringent education policy in Italy aiming at eliminating illiteracy which was a serious problem in Italy at the time and improving loyalty of Italians to the state.&lt;ref&gt;Pauley, pp. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce drop-outs, the government changed the minimum age of leaving school from twelve to fourteen and strictly enforced attendance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pauley_2&quot;&gt;Pauley, pp. 117&lt;/ref&gt; The Fascist government's first minister of education from 1922 to 1924, [[Giovanni Gentile]] recommended that education policy should focus on indoctrination of students into Fascism, and to educate youth to respect and be obedient to authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pauley_2&quot;/&gt; In 1929, education policy took a major step towards being completely taken over by the agenda of indoctrination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pauley_2&quot;/&gt; In that year, the Fascist government took control of the authorization of all textbooks, all secondary school teachers were required to take an oath of loyalty to Fascism, and children began to be taught that they owed the same loyalty to Fascism as they did to God.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pauley_2&quot;/&gt; In 1933, all university teachers were required to be members of the National Fascist Party.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pauley_2&quot;/&gt; From 1930s to 1940s, Italy's education focused on the history of Italy displaying Italy as a force of civilization during the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] era, displaying the rebirth of [[Italian nationalism]] and the struggle for Italian independence and unity during the ''[[Risorgimento]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pauley, Pp. 117&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1930s, the Fascist government copied [[Nazi Germany]]'s education system on the issue of physical fitness, and began an agenda that demanded that Italians become physically healthy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pauley_2&quot;/&gt;

Intellectual talent in Italy was rewarded and promoted by the Fascist government through the [[Royal Academy of Italy]] which was created in 1926 to promote and coordinate Italy's intellectual activity.&lt;ref&gt;Cannistraro, Philip V. (1982) Historical Dictionary of Fascist Italy, Westport, Conn.; London : Greenwood Press, ISBN 0-313-21317-8. Pp. 474&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social welfare ====
A major success in social policy in Fascist Italy was the creation of the ''[[Opera Nazionale Dopolavoro]]'' (OND) or &quot;National After-work Program&quot; in 1925. The OND was the state's largest recreational organizations for adults.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pauley_3&quot;&gt;Pauley, p113&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Dopolavoro'' was so popular that, by the 1930s, all towns in Italy had a ''Dopolavoro'' clubhouse and the ''Dopolavoro'' was responsible for establishing and maintaining 11,000 sports grounds, over 6,400 libraries, 800 movie houses, 1,200 theatres, and over 2,000 orchestras.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pauley_3&quot;/&gt; Membership in the ''Dopolavoro'' was voluntary but had high participation because of its nonpolitical nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pauley_3&quot;/&gt; In the 1930s under the direction of [[Achille Starace]] the OND became primarily recreational, concentrating on sports and other outings. It is estimated that by 1936 the OND had organized 80% of salaried workers.&lt;ref&gt;de Grazia, Victoria. ''The Culture of Consent: Mass Organizations of Leisure in Fascist Italy.'' Cambridge, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 40% of the industrial workforce had been recruited into the Dopolavoro by 1939 and the sports activities proved popular with large numbers of workers. The OND had the largest membership of any of the mass Fascist organizations in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Kallis, Aristotle, ed. (2003). ''The Fascism Reader,'' London: Routledge, pages 391-395.&lt;/ref&gt; The enormous success of the ''Dopolavoro'' in Fascist Italy was the key factor in Nazi Germany creating its own version of the ''Dopolavoro'', the ''[[Kraft durch Freude]]'' (KdF) or &quot;Strength through Joy&quot; program, which was even more successful than the ''Dopolavoro''.&lt;ref&gt;Pauley, p113–114&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Police state ====
For security of the regime, Mussolini advocated complete state authority, and created the ''[[Blackshirts|Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale]]'' or National Security Volunteer Militia in 1923, which are commonly referred to as the Blackshirts for the colour of their uniforms. Most of the Blackshirts were members from the ''Fasci di Combattimento''. A secret police force called the [[Organization for Vigilance and Repression of Anti-Fascism|''Organizzazione di Vigilanza Repressione dell'Antifascismo'']] (Organization for Vigilance and Repression of Anti-Fascism) or OVRA was created in 1927. It was led by [[Arturo Bocchini]] to crack down on opponents of the regime and Mussolini (there had been several near-miss assassination attempts on Mussolini's life in his early years in power). This force was effective, but unlike the [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS) in [[Nazi Germany]] or the [[NKVD]] of the [[Soviet Union]], the OVRA caused far fewer deaths of political opponents. However Fascists methods of repression were cruel which included physically forcing opponents of Fascism to swallow [[castor oil]] which would cause severe diarrhea and dehydration, leaving the victim in a painful and physically debilitated state which would sometimes would result in death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

To combat organized crime, especially the [[Mafia]] in [[Sicily]] and other parts of southern Italy, the Fascists gave special powers in 1925 to [[Cesare Mori]], the prefect of [[Palermo]]. These powers gave him the ability to prosecute the Mafia, forcing many Mafiosi to flee abroad (many to the [[United States]]) or risk being jailed.&lt;ref&gt;

He was removed from his position in 1929, and the Fascist regime declared that the threat of the Mafia had been eliminated. Mori's actions weakened the Mafia, but did not destroy them. From 1929 to 1943, the Fascist regime completely abandoned its previously aggressive measures against the Mafia, and the Mafiosi were left relatively undisturbed.

Mussolini and the Fascist Party promised Italians a new economic system called [[corporatism]]. Corporatism was an outgrowth of socialism into a new economic system where the means of production where nominally left in the hands of the civil sector, but directed and controlled by the State.

In 1935, the ''[[Doctrine of Fascism]]'' was published under Mussolini's name, although it was most likely written by [[Giovanni Gentile]]. It described the role of the state in the economy under corporatism. By this time, Fascism had been drawn more towards the support of market forces being dominant over state intervention.

{{Quotation|The corporate State considers that private enterprise in the sphere of production is the most effective and useful instrument in the interest of the nation. In view of the fact that private organisation of production is a function of national concern, the organiser of the enterprise is responsible to the State for the direction given to production.
State intervention in economic production arises only when private initiative is lacking or insufficient, or when the political interests of the State are involved. This intervention may take the form of control, assistance or direct management. ''Doctrine of Fascism, 1935.''&lt;ref&gt;Mussolini, Benito. 1935. Fascism: Doctrine and Institutions. Rome: Ardita Publishers. p 135-136.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fascists claimed that this system would be egalitarian and traditional at the same time. The economic policy of corporatism quickly faltered: the left-wing elements of the Fascist manifesto were opposed by industrialists and landowners who supported the party because it pledged to defend Italy from communism and socialism. As a result, corporatist policy became dominated by the industries. Throughout the Mussolini era, economic legislation mostly favoured the wealthy industrial and agrarian classes by allowing privatization, liberalization of rent laws and dismantling of non-Fascist unions. While the Fascist unions could not protect workers from all economic consequences, they were responsible for the handling of social security benefits, claims for severance pay, and could sometimes negotiate contracts that benefited workers.&lt;ref&gt;Pauley, p85&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Great Depression hit the world economy in 1929, the Fascist regime followed other nations in enacting protectionist tariffs and attempted to set direction for the economy. In the 1930s, the government increased wheat production, and made Italy self-sufficient for wheat, ending imports of wheat from [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pauley_4&quot;&gt;Pauley, p86&lt;/ref&gt; However the transfer of agricultural land to wheat production reduced the production of vegetables and fruit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pauley_4&quot;/&gt; Despite improving production for wheat, the situation for peasants themselves did not improve. 0.5% of the Italian population (usually wealthy), owned 42 percent of all agricultural land in Italy,&lt;ref name=&quot;Pauley_5&quot;&gt;Pauley, p87&lt;/ref&gt; and income for peasants did not increase while taxes did increase.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pauley_5&quot;/&gt; The Depression caused unemployment to rise from 300,000 to 1 million in 1933.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pauley_6&quot;&gt;Pauley, p88&lt;/ref&gt; It also caused a 10 percent drop in real income and a fall in exports. Italy fared better than most western nations during the Depression: its welfare services did reduce the impact of the Depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pauley_6&quot;/&gt; Its industrial growth from 1913 to 1938 was even greater than that of Germany for the same time period. Only the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Scandinavia]]n nations had a higher industrial growth during that period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pauley_6&quot;/&gt;

Italy's colonial expansion into Ethiopia in 1936, proved to have a negative impact on Italy's economy. The budget of the colony of [[Italian East Africa]] in the 1936-37 fiscal year requested from Italy 19.136 billion lire to be used create the necessary infrastructure for the colony.&lt;ref&gt;Cannistraro, Philip V. 1982. ''Historical Dictionary of Fascist Italy.'' Westport, Connecticut; London, England: Greenwood Press. Pp. 5&lt;/ref&gt; At the time Italy's entire revenue that year was only 18.581 billion lire.&lt;ref&gt;Cannistraro, pp. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women====
The fascists paid special attention to the role of women, from elite society women to factory workers&lt;ref&gt;Perry R. Willson, ''The Clockwork Factory: Women and Work in Fascist Italy'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; and peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Perry R. Willson, ''Peasant Women and Politics in Fascist Italy: The Massaie Rurali'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  Fascist leaders sought to &quot;rescue&quot; women from experiencing emancipation even as they trumpeted the advent of the &quot;new Italian woman&quot; (nuova italiana).&lt;ref&gt;Victoria De Grazia, ''How Fascism Ruled Women: Italy, 1922-1945'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; The policies revealed a deep conflict between modernity and traditional patriarchal authority, as Catholic, Fascist and commercial models of conduct competed to shape women's perceptions of their roles and their society at large. The Fascists celebrated violent &quot;virilist&quot; politics and exaggerated its machismo while also taxing celibate men to pay for child welfare programs.  Italy's invasion of Ethiopia in 1935 and the resulting League of Nations sanctions shaped the tasks assigned to women within the Fascist Party. The empire and women's contribution to it became a core theme in Fascist propaganda. Women in the party were mobilized for the imperial cause both as producers and as consumers, giving them new prominence in the nation. The Fascist women's groups expanded their roles to cover such new tasks as running training courses on how to fight waste in housework. Young Italian women were prepared for a role in Italy's &quot;place in the sun&quot; through special courses created to train them for a future as colonial wives.&lt;ref&gt;Perry Willson, &quot;Empire, Gender and the 'Home Front' in Fascist Italy,&quot; ''Women's History Review,'' Oct 2007, Vol. 16 Issue 4, pp 487-500&lt;/ref&gt;

The government tried to achieve &quot;alimentary sovereignty,&quot; or total self-sufficiency with regard to food supplies.  Its new policies were highly controversial among a people who paid serious attention to their food. The goal was to reduce imports, support Italian agriculture, and encourage an austere diet based on bread, polenta, pasta, fresh produce and wine. Fascist women's groups trained women in &quot;autarkic cookery&quot; to work around items no longer imported.  Food prices climbed in the 1930s and dairy and meat consumption was discouraged, so increasing numbers turned to the black market. The policy demonstrated that Fascists saw food—and people's behavior  generally—as strategic resources that could be manipulated regardless of traditions and tastes.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Helstosky,  &quot;Fascist food politics: Mussolini's policy of alimentary sovereignty, ''Journal of Modern Italian Studies'' March 2004, Vol. 9 Issue 1, pp 1-26&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fascist foreign politics ====
{{Main|Italo-Yemeni Treaty|Italo–Ethiopian Treaty of 1928}}

Benito Mussolini and the Fascist Party promised to bring Italy back as a [[Great Power]] in [[Europe]], making it a &quot;New Roman Empire&quot;. Mussolini promised that Italy would hold power over the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In propaganda, Fascists used the ancient Roman &quot;''[[Italian Mare Nostrum|Mare Nostrum]]''&quot; ([[Latin]] for &quot;Our Sea&quot;) to describe the Mediterranean. The Fascist regime increased funding and attention to military projects, and began plans to create an [[Italian Colonial Empire|Italian Empire]] in Africa, and reclaim dominance in the Mediterranean and [[Adriatic Sea]]. The Fascists considered wars to conquer [[Dalmatia]], [[Albania]] and [[Greece]] for the Italian Empire.

[[Image:Italian empire 1940.PNG|thumb|left|The Italian Empire in 1940]]

Colonial efforts in Africa began in the 1920s, as civil war plagued [[Italian North Africa]] (''Africa Settentrionale Italiana'', or ASI) as the Arab population there refused to accept Italian colonial rule. Mussolini sent [[Marshal]] [[Rodolfo Graziani]] to lead a [[punitive pacification]] campaign against the Arab nationalists. [[Omar Mukhtar]], led the Arab resistance movement. After a much-disputed truce on 3 January 1928, the Fascist policy in Libya increased in brutality. A [[Frontier Wire (Libya)|barbed wire fence]] was built from the [[Mediterranean]] to the oasis of [[Jaghbub, Libya|Jaghbub]] to sever lines critical to the resistance. Soon afterwards, the colonial administration began the wholesale deportation of the people of the [[Jebel Akhdar (Libya)|Jebel Akhdar]] to deny the rebels the support of the local population. The forced migration of more than 100,000 people ended in concentration camps in [[Suluq]] and [[Al-'Aghela]] where tens of thousands died in squalid conditions. It's estimated that the number of Libyans who died - killed either through combat or starvation and disease - was at least 80,000, and up to half of the Cyrenaican population. After Al-Mukhtar's capture September 15, 1931 and his execution in Benghazi, the resistance petered out. Limited resistance to the Italian occupation crystallized round the person of [[Idris of Libya|Sheik Idris]], the Emir of Cyrenaica.

Negotiations occurred with the British government on expanding the borders of the colony of Libya. The first negotiations began in 1925 to define the border between Libya and British-held [[Egypt]]. These negotiations resulted in Italy gaining previously undefined territory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS010.pdf IBS No. 10 - Libya (LY) &amp; Sudan (SU) 1961&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, once again the Italian government requested more territory for Libya from British-held [[Sudan]]. Britain allowed Italy to gain some territory from Sudan to add to Libya. [http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS010.pdf] These concessions were probably allowed because of the relatively good relations between Italy and Britain prior to 1935.

In 1935, Mussolini believed that the time was right for Italy to invade [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]] (a.k.a. Abyssinia) to make it a colony. As a result, the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] erupted. Italy invaded Ethiopia from the Italian colonies of [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland|Somaliland]]. Italy committed atrocities against the Ethiopians during the war, including the use of aircraft to drop [[poison gas]] on the defending Ethiopian soldiers. Ethiopia surrendered in 1936, completing Italy's revenge for its failed colonial conquest of the 1880s. King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] was soon proclaimed [[Emperor of Ethiopia]]. The international consequences for Italy's belligerence resulted in its isolation at the [[League of Nations]]. France and Britain quickly abandoned their trust of Mussolini. The only nation to back Italy's aggression was Nazi Germany. After being condemned by the League of Nations, the [[Grand Council of Fascism]] declared Italy's decision to leave the League on December 11, 1937 and Mussolini denounced the League as a mere &quot;tottering temple&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Martin (introduction). 1989. The Illustrated London News: Marching to War, 1933-1939. Toronto, Canada: Doubleday Canada Ltd. Pp 137&lt;/ref&gt; 

After pressure was placed on Italy by Nazi Germany to promote a racist agenda, the Fascist regime moved away from its previous promotion of colonialism based on the spread of Italian culture to a directly racist colonial agenda. The Fascist regime declared that it would promote mass Italian settlements in the colonies that would in the Fascist regime's terms, &quot;create in the heart of the African continent a powerful and homogeneous nucleus of whites strong enough to draw those populations within our economic orbit and our Roman and Fascist civilization&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sarti, Roland. 1974. ''The Ax Within: Italian Fascism in Action.'' New York: New Viewpoints. p189.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascist rule in its Italian colonies differed from region to region. Rule in [[Italian East Africa]] (''Africa Orientale Italiana'', or AOI), a colony including Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Italian Somaliland, was harsh for the native peoples as Fascist policy sought to destroy native culture. In February 1937, [[Rodolfo Graziani]] ordered Italian soldiers to pillage native settlements in [[Addis Ababa]], which resulted in hundreds of [[Ethiopians]] being killed and their homes being burned to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Sarti, p191.&lt;/ref&gt; After the occupation of [[Ethiopia]], the Fascist regime endorsed [[racial segregation]] to reduce the number of mixed offspring in Italian colonies which they claimed would &quot;pollute&quot; the Italian race.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sarti&quot;&gt;Sarti, p190.&lt;/ref&gt; Marital and sexual relationships between Italians and Africans in its colonies were made a criminal offense when the Fascist regime implemented decree-law No. 880 of April 19, 1937 which gave sentences of one to five years imprisonment to Italians caught in such relationships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sarti&quot;/&gt;  The law did not give any sentences to native Africans, as the Fascist government claimed that only those Italians were to blame for damaging the prestige of their race.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sarti&quot;/&gt; Despite racist language used in some propaganda, the Fascist regime accepted recruitment of native Africans who wanted to join Italy's colonial armed forces and native African colonial recruits were displayed in propaganda.[http://www.germaniainternational.com/images/bookgijuinit13.jpg][http://www.germaniainternational.com/images/bookgijuinit14.jpg] In [[Italian Libya]], Mussolini downplayed racist policies as he attempted to earn the trust of Arab leaders there. Individual freedom, inviolability of home and property, right to join the military or civil administrations, and the right to freely pursue a career or employment were guaranteed to [[Libyans]] by December 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sarti&quot;/&gt; In famous trip to Libya in 1937, a propaganda event was created when on March 18 Mussolini posed with [[Arab]] dignitaries who gave him an honorary &quot;[[Sword of Islam]]&quot; (that had actually been made in [[Florence]]) which was to symbolize Mussolini as a protector of the [[Muslim]] Arab peoples there.&lt;ref&gt;Sarti, p194.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, laws were passed that allowed Muslims to be permitted to join the [[National Fascist Party]] and in particular the [[Muslim Association of the Lictor]] (''Associazione Musulmana del Littorio'') for Muslim Libya, and the 1939 reforms allowed the creation of Libyan military units within the Italian army.&lt;ref&gt;Sarti, p196.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fascist regime also engaged in interventionist foreign policy in Europe. In 1923, Italian soldiers captured the Greek island of [[Corfu]] as part of the Fascists' plan to eventually take over [[Greece]]. Corfu was later returned to Greece and war between Greece and Italy was avoided. In 1925, Italy forced Albania to become a ''de facto'' [[protectorate]] which helped Italy's stand against Greek sovereignty. Corfu was important to Italian imperialism and nationalism due to its presence in the former [[Republic of Venice]] which left behind significant Italian cultural monuments and influence, though the Greek population there, especially youth, heavily protested the Italian occupation. Relations with France were mixed, the Fascist regime consistently had the intention to eventually wage war on France to regain Italian-populated areas of France,&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith_3&quot;&gt;Smith. 1983. p172&lt;/ref&gt; but with the rise of Hitler, the Fascists immediately became more concerned of Austria's independence and the potential threat of Germany to Italy, if it demanded the German-populated areas of [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]]. Due to concerns of German expansionism, Italy joined the [[Stresa Front]] with France and the United Kingdom against Germany which existed from 1935 to 1936. The Fascist regime held negative relations with Yugoslavia, as they long wanted the implosion of Yugoslavia in order to territorially expand and increase Italy's power. Italy pursued [[espionage]] in Yugoslavia, as Yugoslav authorities on multiple occasions discovered spy rings in the Italian Embassy in Yugoslavia  such as in 1930.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith_3&quot;/&gt; In 1929, the Fascist government accepted Croatian extreme nationalist [[Ante Pavelić]] as a political exile to Italy from Yugoslavia. The Fascists gave Pavelić financial assistance and a training ground in Italy to develop and train his newly formed fascist militia and terrorist group, the [[Ustaše]]. This organization later became the ruling force of the [[Independent State of Croatia]], and murdered hundreds of thousands of [[Serbs]], [[Jews]] and other minorities during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Glenny, Misha. Balkans: Nationalism, War and the Great Powers, 1804-1999. New York, USA: Penguin Books, 2001. Pp. 431&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 in Spain, the Fascist regime made its most significant pre-war military intervention. The [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]] was divided in the [[Spanish Civil War]] between the [[anticlerical]] socialist Republicans and the Church-supporting, monarchy-backed nationalists led by [[Francisco Franco]] under his fascist [[Falange]] movement. Italy sent aircraft, weapons, and a total of over 60,000 troops to aid the Spanish nationalists. The war helped train the Italian military for war and improve relations with the Catholic Church. It was a success that secured Italy's naval access in and out of the Mediterranean to the Atlantic and its ability to pursue its policy of ''[[Italian Mare Nostrum|Mare Nostrum]]'' without fear of opposition by Spain. The other major foreign contributor to the Spanish Civil War was Nazi Germany. This was the first time that Italian and German forces fought together since the Austro-Prussian War in the 1860s. During the 1930s, Italy built many large battleships and other warships to solidify Italy's hold on the Mediterranean.

After Germany annexed [[Czechoslovakia]], Mussolini decided to capture [[Albania]] to avoid becoming second-rate member of Axis. On April 7, 1939, [[Italian invasion of Albania|Italy invaded Albania]]. After short campaign Albania was occupied, and its parliament crowned Victor Emmanuel III [[King of Albania]]. The historical justification for the annexation of Albania laid in the ancient history of the [[Roman Empire]] in which the region of Albania had been an early conquest for the Romans, even before northern Italy had been taken by Roman forces. But obviously by the time of annexation, little connection to Italy remained amongst [[Albanians]]. In actuality, the annexation of Albania was far from a military conquest as the country had been a de facto protectorate of Italy since the 1920s and much of its army were commanded by Italian officers sent from Italy.  The occupation was not appreciated by King Emmanuel III, who feared that it had isolated Italy even further than its war against Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1997. p398-399&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] (NSDAP, a.k.a. Nazi Party) attained power in Germany in 1933, Mussolini and the Fascist regime in public showed approval of Hitler's regime, with Mussolini saying &quot;The victory of Hitler is our victory&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Denis Mack. 1983. ''Mussolini: A Biography.'' New York: Vintage Books. p181&lt;/ref&gt; The Fascist regime also spoke of creating an alliance with the new regime in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1983. p181&lt;/ref&gt;
In private, Mussolini and the Italian Fascists showed disapproval of the Nazi government and Mussolini had a disapproving view of Hitler despite ideological similarities. The Fascists distrusted Hitler's [[Pan-German]] ideas which they saw as a threat to territories in Italy that previously had been part of [[Austrian Empire]]. Although other Nazis disapproved of Mussolini and Fascist Italy, Hitler had long idolized Mussolini's oratorical and visual persona, and adopted much of the symbolism of the Fascists into the Nazi Party, such as the Roman, straight-armed salute, dramatic oratory, the use of uniformed paramilitaries for political violence, and the use of mass rallies to demonstrate the power of the movement. In 1922 Hitler tried to ask for Mussolini's guidance on how to organize his own version of the [[March on Rome]] which would be a &quot;March on Berlin&quot; (which came into being as the failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in 1923). Mussolini did not respond to Hitler's requests as he did not have much interest in Hitler's movement and regarded Hitler to be somewhat crazy.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1983. p172&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini did attempt to read ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' to find out what Hitler's [[Nazism|National Socialist movement]] was but was immediately disappointed, saying that ''Mein Kampf'' was &quot;a boring tome that I have never been able to read&quot; and remarked that Hitler's beliefs were &quot;little more than commonplace clichés.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith_3&quot;/&gt; While Mussolini like Hitler believed in the cultural and moral superiority of whites over coloured peoples,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sarti&quot;/&gt; he opposed Hitler's [[anti-Semitic]] beliefs. A number of Fascists were Jewish, including Mussolini's mistress [[Margherita Sarfatti]], the director of Fascist art and propaganda, and there was little support amongst Italians for anti-Semitism. Mussolini also did not evaluate race as being a precursor of superiority, but rather culture.

Hitler and the Nazis continued to try to woo Mussolini to their cause, and eventually Mussolini gave financial assistance to the Nazi party and allowed Nazi paramilitaries to train in Italy in the belief that despite differences, a fascist regime in Germany could be beneficial to Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith_3&quot;/&gt; Suspicion of the Nazis increased after 1933, Mussolini sought to ensure that Nazi Germany would not become the dominant fascist state in Europe. To do this, Mussolini opposed German efforts to annex Austria after the assassination of fascist Austrian President [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] in 1934, and promised the Austrians military support if Germany were to interfere. This promise helped save Austria from annexation in 1934.

Public appearances and propaganda constantly portrayed the closeness of Mussolini and Hitler and the similarities between Italian [[Fascism]] and German [[Nazism|National Socialism]]. While both ideologies had significant similarities, the two factions were suspicious of each other, and both leaders were in competition for world influence. Hitler and Mussolini first met in June 1934, as the issue of Austrian independence was in crisis. In private, after the visit in 1934, Mussolini said that Hitler was just &quot;a silly little monkey&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiritus-temporis.com/june-1934/ What happened in June 1934 - Historical Events, News Archives&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

After Italy became isolated in 1936, the government had little choice but to work with Germany to regain a stable bargaining position in international affairs and reluctantly abandoned its support of Austrian independence from Germany. On October 28, 1937, Mussolini declared Italy's support of Germany regaining its colonies lost in [[World War I]], declaring&quot;
{{Quotation|&quot;A great people such as the German people must regain the place which is due to it, and which it used to have beneath the sun of Africa.&quot; ''Benito Mussolini, October 28, 1937.''&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert. 1989. Pp 137&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With no significant opposition from Italy, Hitler proceeded with ''[[Anschluß]]'', the annexation of Austria in 1938. Germany later claimed the [[Sudetenland]], a province of [[Czechoslovakia]] inhabited mostly by [[Germans]]. Mussolini felt he had little choice but to help Germany to avoid isolation. With the annexation of Austria by Germany in 1938, the Fascist regime began to be concerned about the majority ethnic German population in [[southern Tyrol]], and whether they would want to join a [[Nazi Germany|Greater Germany]]. The Fascists were also concerned about whether Italy should follow Nazi anti-Semitic policies in order to gain favour from those Nazis who had mixed feelings about Italy as an ally. In 1938, Mussolini pressured fellow Fascist members to support the enacting of anti-Semitic policies, but this was not well taken, as a number of Fascists were Jewish and anti-Semitism was not an active political concept in Italy. Nevertheless, Mussolini forced through anti-Semitic legislation even while his own son-in-law and prominent Fascist [[Count]] [[Galeazzo Ciano]] personally condemned such laws. In turn for enacting the extremely unpopular anti-Semitic laws, Mussolini and the Fascist government demanded a concession from Hitler and the Nazis. In 1939 the Fascists demanded from Hitler that his government willingly accept the Italian government's plan to have all Germans in south Tyrol either leave Italy or be forced to accept Italianization. Hitler agreed and thus the threat to Italy from the south Tyrol Germans was neutralized.

As war approached in 1939, the Fascist regime stepped up an aggressive press campaign against France claiming that Italian people were suffering in France.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1997. 397&lt;/ref&gt; This was important to the alliance as both regimes mutually had claims on France, Germany on German-populated [[Alsace-Lorraine]] and Italy on the mixed Italian and French populated [[Nice]] and [[Corsica]]. In May 1939, a formal alliance was organized. The alliance was known as the [[Pact of Steel]] which obliged Italy to fight alongside Germany if war broke out against Germany. Mussolini felt obliged to sign the pact in spite of his own concerns that Italy could not fight a war in the near future. This obligation grew from his promises to Italians that he would build an empire for them and from his personal desire to not allow Hitler to become the dominant leader in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1997. p401&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini was repulsed by the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] agreement where Germany and the [[Soviet Union]] agreed to partition the [[Second Polish Republic]] into German and Soviet zones for an impending invasion. The Fascist government saw this as a betrayal of the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], but decided to remain officially silent.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1997. 401&lt;/ref&gt;

==== World War II and the fall of Fascism ====
{{refimprove section|date=March 2011}}
{{Main|Military history of Italy during World War II}}

When Germany [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939 beginning [[World War II]], Mussolini publicly declared on September 24, 1939, that Italy had the choice of entering the war or to remain neutral which would cause the country to lose its national dignity. Nevertheless, despite his aggressive posture, Mussolini kept Italy out of the conflict for many months. Mussolini told his son in law, Count Ciano, that he was personally jealous over Hitler's accomplishments and hoped that Hitler's prowess would be slowed down by Allied counterattack.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1997. p402.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini went as far to lessen Germany's successes in Europe by giving advanced notice to [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] of an imminent German invasion, of which Germany had informed Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1997. p402&lt;/ref&gt;

In drawing out war plans, Mussolini and the Fascist regime decided that Italy would aim to annex large portions of Africa and the Middle East to be included in its colonial empire. Hesitance remained from the King and military commander [[Pietro Badoglio]] who warned Mussolini that Italy had too few [[tank]]s, [[armoured vehicle]]s, and [[aircraft]] available to be able to carry out a long-term war and Badoglio told Mussolini &quot;It is suicide&quot; for Italy to get involved in the [[European Theater of World War II|European conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1997. 405&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini and the Fascist regime took the advice to a degree and waited as France was invaded by Germany before deciding to get involved.

As France collapsed under the German [[Blitzkrieg]], Italy declared war on France and Britain on 10 June 1940, fulfilling its obligations of the Pact of Steel. Italy hoped to quickly conquer [[Savoy]], [[Nice]], [[Corsica]], and the African colonies of [[Tunisia]] and [[Algeria]] from the French, but this was quickly stopped when Germany signed an armistice with the French commander [[Philippe Petain]] who established [[Vichy France]] which retained control over Savoy, Nice, Corsica, Tunisia and Algeria. This decision by Germany angered the Fascist regime.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1997. p406&lt;/ref&gt;

The one Italian strength that concerned the Allies was the Italian Royal Navy (''[[Regia Marina]]''), the fourth largest navy in the world at the time. In 1940, the British [[Royal Navy]] launched a surprise air attack on the Italian fleet at [[Battle of Taranto|Taranto]] which crippled Italy's major warships. Although the Italian fleet did not inflict serious damage as was feared, it did keep significant [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] naval forces in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. This fleet had to fight the Italian fleet to keep British Commonwealth forces in Egypt and the Middle East from being cut off from Britain. In 1941 on the Italian-controlled island of [[Kastelorizo]], off the coast of [[Turkey]], Italian forces succeeded in repelling British and Australian forces attempting to occupy the island during [[Operation Abstention]]. In December 1941, a covert attack by Italian forces took place in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]], in which Italian divers attached explosives to British warships resulting in two British battleships being sunk. This was known as the [[Raid on Alexandria (1941)|Raid on Alexandria]]. In 1942, the Italian navy inflicted a serious blow to a British convoy fleet attempting to reach [[Malta]] during [[Operation Harpoon (1942)|Operation Harpoon]], sinking multiple British vessels. Over time, the Allied navies inflicted serious damage to the Italian fleet, and ruined Italy's one advantage to Germany.

Continuing indications of Italy's subordinate nature to Germany arose during the [[Greco-Italian War]], which was disastrous for the poorly armed Italian Army. Mussolini had intended the war with Greece to prove to Germany that Italy was no minor power in the alliance, but a capable empire which could hold its own weight. Mussolini boasted to his government that he would even resign from being Italian if anyone found fighting the Greeks to be difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1997. p407&lt;/ref&gt; Within days of invading Greece, the Greek army pushed the Italian army back into Albania and humiliatingly put Italy on the defensive.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1997. p408&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler and the German government were frustrated with Italy's failing campaigns, but so was Mussolini. Mussolini in private angrily accused Italians on the battlefield of becoming &quot;overcome with a crisis of artistic sentimentalism and throw in the towel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1997. p409&lt;/ref&gt;

To gain back ground in Greece, Germany reluctantly began a [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkans Campaign]] alongside Italy which resulted also in the destruction of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] in 1941 and the ceding of Dalmatia to Italy. Mussolini and Hitler compensated Croatian nationalists by endorsing the creation of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] under the extreme nationalist [[Ustaše]]. In order to receive the support of Italy, the Ustaše agreed to concede the main central portion of [[Dalmatia]] as well as various Adriatic islands to Italy, as Dalmatia held a significant number of Italians. The ceding of the Adriatic islands by Croatia was a minimal loss for their government, as in exchange for those cessions, Croatia was allowed to annex all of modern-day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and to persecute the Serb population there to make way for future Croat habitation there. Officially, Croatia was a kingdom and an Italian protectorate, ruled by Italian [[House of Savoy]] member [[Tomislav II of Croatia]], however he never personally set foot on Croatian soil, and the government was run by [[Ante Pavelić]], the leader of the Ustaše. Italy did however hold military control across all of Croatia's coast, which combined with Italian control of Albania and Montenegro, gave Italy complete control of the Adriatic Sea, thus completing a key part of the ''[[Mare Nostrum]]'' policy of the Fascists. The Ustaše movement proved valuable to Italy and Germany as a means to counter [[Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland|Royalist Chetnik guerrillas]] (although they did work with them because they did not really like the Ustaše movement whom they left up to the Germans) and the communist [[Yugoslav Partisans]] under [[Josip Broz Tito]] who opposed the occupation of Yugoslavia.

In 1940, Italy invaded [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]] and was soon driven far back into [[Libya]] by British Commonwealth forces. The German army sent a detachment to join the Italian army in Libya to save the colony from the British advance. German army units in the [[Afrika Korps]] under General [[Erwin Rommel]] were the mainstay in the campaign to push the British out of Libya and into central Egypt in 1941 to 1942. The victories in Egypt were almost entirely credited to Rommel's strategic brilliance. The Italian forces received little media attention in [[North Africa]] because of their dependence on the superior weaponry and experience of Rommel's forces. For a time in 1942, Italy from an official standpoint controlled large amounts of territory along the Mediterranean. With the collapse of Vichy France, Italy gained control of [[Corsica]] (which had a mixed population of French and Italians), Nice and other portions of southwestern France. Italy also oversaw a military occupation over significant sections of southern France. But despite the official territorial achievements, the so called &quot;Italian Empire&quot; was a [[paper tiger]] by 1942: it was faltering as its economy failed to adapt to the conditions of war, and Italian cities were being bombed by the Allies. Also, despite Rommel's advances in 1941 and early 1942, the campaign in North Africa began to collapse in late 1942. Complete collapse came in 1943 when German and Italian forces fled North Africa to [[Sicily]].

By 1943, Italy was failing on every front, by January of the year, half of the Italian forces serving on the Eastern Front had been destroyed,&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith_4&quot;&gt;Smith, 1997. p412&lt;/ref&gt; the African campaign had collapsed, the Balkans remained unstable, and Italians wanted an end to the war.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1997. p412-413&lt;/ref&gt; King Victor Emmanuel III urged Count Ciano to overstep Mussolini to try to begin talks with the Allies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith_4&quot;/&gt; In mid 1943, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] commenced an [[Allied invasion of Sicily|invasion of Sicily]] in an effort to knock Italy out of the war and establish a foothold in [[Europe]]. Allied troops landed in Sicily with little initial opposition from Italian forces. The situation changed as the Allies ran into German forces, who held out for some time before Sicily was taken over by the Allies. The invasion made Mussolini dependent on the German Armed Forces (''[[Wehrmacht]]'') to protect his regime. The Allies steadily advanced through Italy with little opposition from demoralized Italian soldiers, while facing serious opposition from German forces.

=== Civil war (1943–1945) ===
[[File:Germaniamica.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Italian Social Republic]] poster saying: ''&quot;Germany is truly your friend&quot;'']]
By 1943, Mussolini had lost the support of the Italian population for having led a disastrous war effort. To the world, Mussolini was viewed as a &quot;sawdust caesar&quot; for having led his country to war with ill-equipped and poorly trained armed forces which failed in battle. The embarrassment of Mussolini to Italy led [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel III]] and even members of the Fascist Party to desire Mussolini's removal. The first stage of his ouster took place when Fascist Party's Grand Council under the direction of Fascist member [[Dino Grandi]] voted to remove Mussolini as the party's leader. Days later, on 26 July 1943, Emmanuel III officially removed Mussolini from the post of Prime Minister and replaced him with Marshal [[Pietro Badoglio]]. Upon removal, Mussolini was immediately arrested. The new &quot;Badoglio government&quot; stripped away the final elements of Fascist rule by banning the Fascist Party. Italy then signed an [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|armistice with the Allied armed forces]] and the Kingdom of Italy joined the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in their war against [[Nazi Germany]]. The new [[Royalist]] government of Victor Emmanuel III and Marshal Badoglio raised an [[Italian Co-Belligerent Army]], an [[Italian Co-Belligerent Navy]], and an [[Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force]]. The Bagdolio government attempted to establish a non-partisan administration and a number of political parties were allowed to exist again after years of ban under Fascism. These ranged from liberal to communist parties which all were part of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1997. p418.&lt;/ref&gt; Italians celebrated the fall of Mussolini and as more Italian territory was taken by the Allies, the Allies were welcomed as liberators by Italians, who opposed the German occupation.

However, Mussolini's reign in Italy was not over. A German commando unit led by [[Otto Skorzeny]] rescued Mussolini from the mountain hotel where he was being held under arrest.  Hitler instructed Mussolini to establish the [[Italian Social Republic]] in German-held northern Italy.  The Italian Social Republic was a German [[puppet state]]. The Fascist state's armed forces were a combination of Mussolini loyalist Fascists and German armed forces. However Mussolini had little power, Hitler and the German armed forces led the campaign against the Allies and saw little interest in preserving Italy as little more than a buffer zone against an Allied invasion of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1997. p419&lt;/ref&gt;

Life for Italians under German occupation was hard especially in Rome. Rome's citizens by 1943 had grown tired of the war and upon Italy signing an armistice with the Allies on September 8, 1943, Rome's citizens took to the streets chanting &quot;Viva la pace!&quot; (&quot;Long live the peace!) but within hours, German forces raided the city, and attacked anti-Fascists, royalists, and Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Robert. 1979. ''World War II: The Italian Campaign.'' New York: Time-Life Books. Pp. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Roman citizens were harassed by German soldiers to provide them food and fuel and German authorities would arrest all opposition and many were sent into forced labour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace&quot;&gt;Wallace, 1979. Pp. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Rome's citizens upon being liberated reported that during the first week of German occupation of Rome, crimes against Italian citizens took place, as German soldiers looted stores and robbed Roman citizens at gunpoint.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace&quot;/&gt; Martial law was imposed on Rome by German authorities requiring all citizens to obey a curfew forbidding people to be out on the street after 9 p.m.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace&quot;/&gt; During winter of 1943, Rome's citizens were denied access to sufficient food, firewood, and coal which were taken by German authorities to be given to German soldiers housed in occupied hotels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace&quot;/&gt; These actions left Rome's citizens to live in the harsh cold and were on the verge of starvation.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, 1979. Pp. 41-42&lt;/ref&gt; German authorities began arresting able-bodied Roman men to be conscripted into forced labour.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, 1979. Pp. 45&lt;/ref&gt; On June 4, 1944, the German occupation of Rome came to an end as German forces retreated as the Allies advanced.

Mussolini was captured on April 27, 1945, by [[Partito Comunista Italiano|communist]] [[Italian partisans]] near the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] border as he tried to escape Italy. On the next day, he was executed for high treason, as sentenced in absentia by a tribunal of the [[National Liberation Committee|CLN]]. Afterwards, the bodies of Mussolini, his mistress, and about fifteen other Fascists were taken to [[Milan]] where they were displayed to the public. Days later on 2 May 1945, the German Army (''[[Wehrmacht Heer]]'') in Italy surrendered.

The government of Badoglio remained in being for some nine months. On 9 June 1944 he was replaced as Prime Minister by the 70-year-old anti-fascist leader [[Ivanoe Bonomi]]. In June 1945 Bonomi was in turn replaced by [[Ferruccio Parri]], who in turn gave way to [[Alcide de Gasperi]] on 4 December 1945. It was de Gasperi who supervised the transition to a Republic following the abdication of Vittorio Emanuele III on 9 May 1946; he briefly became acting Head of State as well as Prime Minister on 18 June 1946, but ceded the former role to Provisional President [[Enrico de Nicola]] ten days later.

=== Birth of Italian Republic (1946) ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
[[File:Umberto4.jpg|thumb|left|175px|[[Umberto II]], the last King of Italy.]]

The aftermath of World War II left Italy with a destroyed economy, a divided society, and anger against the monarchy for its endorsement of the Fascist regime for the previous twenty years{{Citation needed|reason=too simplistic and too coarse|date=April 2010}}. Anger flourished as well over Italy's embarrassment of being occupied by the Germans and then by the Allies.
[[File:Italian referendum 1946 support for republic.svg|thumb|right|[[Birth of the Italian Republic|1946 referendum]] results map]]
Even prior to the rise of the Fascists, the monarchy was seen to have performed poorly, with society extremely divided between the wealthy north and poor south. World War I resulted in Italy making few gains and was seen as what fostered the rise of Fascism. These frustrations compacted into a revival of the Italian republican movement.

Following Victor Emmanuel III's abdication as king in 1946, his son, the new king [[Umberto II of Italy|Umberto II]], was pressured by the threat of [[civil war]] to call a [[referendum]] to decide whether Italy should remain a [[monarchy]] or become a [[republic]]. On 2 June 1946, the republican side won 54% of the vote and Italy officially became a republic. 

The table of results shows some relevant differences in the different parts of Italy. The peninsula seemed to be drastically cut in two areas: the North for the republic (with 66.2%), the South for the monarchy (with 63.8%), as if they were two different, respectively homogeneous countries. Some Monarchist groups claimed that there was manipulation by Northern Republicans and Socialists. Others argued that Italy was still too chaotic in 1946 to have an accurate referendum. Regardless, to prevent civil war, Umberto II abdicated the Italian throne, and a [[Birth of the Italian Republic|new republic]] was born with bitter resentment by the new government against the [[House of Savoy]]. All male members of the Savoy family were barred from entering Italy in 1948, which was only repealed in 2002.

{{refimprove|date=August 2011}}
{{audio|It-Lamberto Dini.ogg|'''Lamberto Dini'''}} (born March 1, 1931) is an [[Italy|Italian]] politician and economist. He was the [[List of Prime Ministers of Italy|75th]] [[Prime Minister of Italy]] from 1995 to 1996 and [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs|Foreign Minister]] from 1996 to 2001.

==Early life and Berlusconi cabinet==
After studying Economics in his native city of [[Florence]], Dini took up a post at the [[International Monetary Fund]] in 1959, where he worked his way up until he served as Executive Director for [[Italy]], [[Greece]], [[Portugal]] and [[Malta]] between 1976 and 1979. Then, in October 1979, he moved to the [[Banca d'Italia]], where he served as executive until May 1994. When the Governor of the Bank of Italy, [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]], with whom Dini had developed a rivalry, was called upon to serve as Premier, in April, 1993, Dini was widely tipped to succeed him, but was passed over (allegedly on Ciampi's instigation) in favour of [[Antonio Fazio]].

Dini scored a comeback, though, when [[Silvio Berlusconi]] formed the [[Berlusconi I Cabinet]] in May 1994, in which Dini served as [[Italian Treasury Minister|Treasury Minister]]. Due to a split between Berlusconi and his coalition partner [[Umberto Bossi]], the [[Lega Nord]] leader, Berlusconi's government collapsed in December 1994, after a mere seven months in power. In January 1995, Dini was appointed Prime Minister by President [[Oscar Luigi Scalfaro]]. Though he was not noted as a [[left-wing]]er, Dini, was given the [[Motion of Confidence|confidence vote]] of the left-wing parties (apart from the [[Communist Refoundation Party (Italy)|Communist Refoundation]]) and by Lega Nord, whereas his erstwhile partners in the right-wing government chose to abstain whilst citing benevolence. In theory, his cabinet was a [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocratic]] one.

==The Olive Tree==
In April, 1996, a [[Italian general election, 1996|general election]] was called, in which Berlusconi's [[House of Freedoms]] coalition, minus the Lega Nord, was pitted against that of [[Romano Prodi]], [[The Olive Tree (political coalition)|The Olive Tree]]. Relations between Dini and Berlusconi had seriously soured by then, and Dini chose to join The Olive Tree with his own [[Centrism|centrist]] party, [[Italian Renewal]]. Dini was elected to the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies]], and served for the entire term as Minister of Foreign Affairs in four successive centre-left governments, under Prodi, [[Massimo D'Alema]] in two separate, successive cabinets, and finally [[Giuliano Amato]].

His party has merged into [[Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy]], a larger party formed out of several centrist parties belonging to the centre-left coalition. The May 2001 the [[Italian general election, 2001|general election]] was won by Berlusconi and his allies (including, once again, Lega Nord), which led to Berlusconi forming his second government in June. Dini was elected to the [[Italian Senate]], and, in this capacity, served as a delegate to the [[Convention on the Future of Europe|Convention]] in charge of drafting the [[European Constitution]] (February 2002-July 2003).

==The People of Freedom==
In September 2007, a month before Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy merged with the [[Democrats of the Left]] to form the new [[big tent]] centre-left [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]], Dini broke away from The Daisy to form the [[Liberal Democrats (Italy)|Liberal Democrats]], a new incarnation of Italian Renewal.

As protagonist of the [[2008 Italian political crisis|defeat of the government]] of Prime Minister [[Romano Prodi]] in a January 2008 Senate vote, in view of the [[Italian general election, 2008|2008 Italian general election]] Dini joined [[The People of Freedom]], the newly created Italian liberal-conservative party led by [[Silvio Berlusconi]].

==Honours==
On 29 April 2009, the Japanese government announced that it has awarded Dini the Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Rising Sun]]; the honour will be presented to him by the Emperor and the Japanese Prime Minister in a formal ceremony in May.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/govt-honors-wbc-team-actors-scientists-in-spring-decorations Japan Today]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lazio''' ({{IPA-it|ˈlattsjo|pron}}, {{lang-la|Latium}}) is one of the 20 administrative [[Regions of Italy|regions]] of Italy, situated in the [[Central Italy|central]] peninsular section of the country. With about 5.7 million residents and a GDP of more than 170 billion euros, Lazio is the third most populated and the second richest region of Italy. It includes [[Rome]], [[capital city|capital]] and [[Largest Cities in Italy|largest city]] of Italy.

== Geography ==
[[File:Lazio SRTM.png|thumb|left|Relief map of Lazio.]]
[[File:Vallée de l'Aniene et Monts Prénestiens.JPG|thumb|left|Panorama of the [[Roman Campagna]].]] 

Lazio comprises a land area of {{convert|17,236|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and it has borders with [[Tuscany]], [[Umbria]], and [[Marche]] to the north, [[Abruzzo]] and [[Molise]] to the east, [[Campania]] to the south, and the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] to the west. The regions is mainly flat and hilly, with small mountainous areas in the most eastern and southern districts.

The coast of Lazio is mainly composed by sandy beaches, punctuated by the headlands of [[Circeo]] (541 m) and [[Gaeta]] (171 m). The [[Pontine Islands]], which are part of Lazio, lie opposite the southern coast. Behind the coastal strip, to the north, lies the [[Maremma]] Laziale (the continuation of Tuscan Maremma), a costal plain interrupted at [[Civitavecchia]] by the [[Tolfa Mountains]] (616 m). The central section of the region is occupied by the [[Roman Campagna]], a vast alluvial plain surrounding the city of Rome, with an area of approximately {{convert|2100|km²|0|abbr=on}}. The southern districts are characterized by the flatlands of [[Agro Pontino]], a once swampy and [[malaria]]l area, that  was [[land reclamation|reclaimed]] over the centuries.

The Preapennines of Latium, marked by the [[Tiber]] valley and the [[Liri]] with the [[Sacco River|Sacco]] tributary, include on the right of the Tiber, three groups of mountains of volcanic origin: the [[Volsini]], [[Cimini]] and [[Monti Sabatini|Sabatini]], whose largest former craters are occupied by the [[Lake Bolsena|Bolsena]], [[Lake Vico|Vico]] and [[Lake Bracciano|Bracciano]] lakes. To the south of the Tiber other mountain groups form part of the Preapennines: the [[Alban Hills]], also of volcanic origin, and the calcareous [[Monti Lepini|Lepini]], [[Ausoni Mountains|Ausoni]] and [[Aurunci Mountains]]. The Apennines of  Latium are a continuation of the Apennines of  Abruzzo: the Reatini Mountains with [[Terminillo]] (2,213 m), Mounts [[Monti Sabini|Sabini]], [[Monti Prenestini|Prenestini]], [[Monti Simbruini|Simbruini]] and [[Monti Ernici|Ernici]] which continue east of the Liri into the [[Mainarde Mountains]]. The highest peak is Mount Gorzano (2,458 m) on the border with Abruzzo.

== History ==
{{For|the history of ancient Lazio|Latium}}''See also: [[History of Italy]]''
[[File:RomaViaAppiaAntica03.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Appian Way]] (''Via Appia''), a road connecting [[Ancient Rome]] to the southern parts of Italy, remains usable even today.]]

The Italian word Lazio descends from the Latin word [[Latium]]. The name of the region also survives in the tribal designation of the ancient population of [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]], Latini in the Latin language spoken by them and passed on to the city-state of [[Ancient Rome]]. Although the demography of ancient Rome was multi-ethnic, including, for example, Etruscans and other Italics besides the Latini, the latter were the dominant constituent. In [[Roman mythology]], the tribe of the Latini took their name from king [[Latinus]]. Apart from the mythical derivation of Lazio given by the ancients as the place where Jupiter &quot;lay hid&quot; from his father seeking to kill him, a major modern etymology is that Lazio comes from the Latin word &quot;latus&quot;, meaning &quot;wide&quot;, expressing the idea of &quot;flat land&quot; meaning the [[Roman Campagna]]. Much of Lazio is in fact flat or rolling. The lands originally inhabited by the Latini were extended into the territories of the [[Samnites]], the [[Marsi]], the [[Hernici]], the [[Aequi]], the [[Aurunci]] and the [[Volsci]], all surrounding Italic tribes.  This larger territory was still called Latium, but it was divided into [[Latium adiectum]] or Latium Novum, the added lands or New Latium, and Latium Vetus, or Old Latium, the older, smaller region.
The northern border of Lazio was the [[Tiber]] river, which divided it from [[Etruria]].

The emperor [[Augustus]] officially united almost all of present-day Italy into a single geo-political entity, [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italia]], dividing it into eleven regions. Lazio – together with the present region of [[Campania]] immediately to the southeast of Lazio and the seat of [[Naples|Neapolis]] – became Region I.
 
After the [[Gothic War (535-554)]] and the Byzantine conquest, this region regained its freedom, because the &quot;Roman Duchy&quot; became the property of the Eastern Emperor. However the long wars against the barbarian [[Longobards]] weakened the region, which was seized by the Roman Bishop who already had several properties in those territories.

The strengthening of the religious and ecclesiastical aristocracy led to continuous power struggles between lords and the Roman bishop until the middle of the 16th century. [[Innocent III]] tried to strengthen his own territorial power, wishing to assert his authority in the provincial administrations of Tuscia, Campagna and Marittima through the Church's representatives, in order to reduce the power of the [[Colonna family]]. Other popes tried to do the same. 

During the period when the papacy resided in [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon, France]] (1309–1377), the feudal lords' power increased due to the absence of the Pope from Rome. Small communes, and Rome above all, opposed the lords' increasing power, and with [[Cola di Rienzo]], they tried to present themselves as antagonists of the ecclesiastical power. However, between 1353 and 1367, the papacy regained control of Lazio and the rest of the [[Papal States]]. 

From the middle of the 16th century, the papacy politically unified Lazio with the [[Papal States]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}, so that these territories became provincial administrations of St. Peter's estate; governors in [[Viterbo]], in Marittima and [[Campagna]], and in [[Frosinone]] administered them for the papacy. 

After the short-lived [[Roman Republic (18th century)]], the region's annexation to France by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in February 1798, Lazio became again part of the [[Papal States]] in October 1799. 

On 20 September 1870 the [[capture of Rome]], during the reign of Pope [[Pius IX]], and France's defeat at [[Battle of Sedan|Sedan]], completed [[Italian unification]], and Lazio was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]].

== Economy ==
Agriculture, crafts, animal husbandry and fishery are the main traditional sources of income. Agriculture is characterized by the cultivation of wine grapes, fruit, vegetables and olives.

Industrial development in Lazio is limited to the areas south of Rome. Communications and - above all - the setting of the border of the [[Cassa del Mezzogiorno]] some kilometers south of Rome, have influenced the position of industry, favouring the areas with the best links to Rome and those near the Autostrada del Sole (motorway), especially around Frosinone. Firms are often small to medium in size and operate in the building and building materials ([[Rome]], [[Civitavecchia]]), paper ([[Sora, Italy|Sora]]), petrochemical ([[Gaeta]], [[Rome]]), textile ([[Frosinone]]), engineering ([[Rieti]], [[Anagni]]), automobile ([[Cassino]]), electronic and electrotechnical ([[Viterbo]]) sectors. 

Approximately 73% of the working population are employed in the services sector; this is a considerable proportion, but is justified by the presence of Rome, which is the core of public administration, banking, tourism, insurance and other sectors. Many national and multinational corporations, public and private, have their headquarters in Rome ([[Eni|ENI]], [[Enel]], [[Finmeccanica]], [[Alitalia]], [[RAI]]).

Lazio's limited industrial sector and highly developed service industries allowed the region to well outperform the Italian economy in 2009. The trend is set to continue over the next few years - the region's economy being among the most dynamic in Italy. This year the economy is predicted to grow by 1.3-1.5%, while in 2011 it is expected to expand by between 2-2.2%. These are the fastest rates in Italy and compare to national figures of between 0.8%-1.1% in 2010 and 1.1%-1.3% in 2011.

With a population of about 5.7 million, Lazio is the third most populated region of Italy. The overall population density in the region is 332 inhabitants per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. However, the population density widely ranges from almost 800 inhabitants per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the highly urbanized [[Province of Rome]] to less than 60 inhabitants per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the mountainous and rural [[Province of Rieti]]. As of January 2010, the Italian national institute of statistics ISTAT estimated that 497,940 foreign-born immigrants live in Lazio, equal to 8.8% of the total regional population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foreign-born population in Italy, 1 January 2010|url=http://www3.istat.it/salastampa/comunicati/non_calendario/20101012_00/testointegrale20101012.pdf|publisher=Istat|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government and politics ==
{{Main|Politics of Lazio}}

Rome is center-left politically oriented by tradition, while the rest of Lazio is center-right oriented. In the [[Italian general election, 2008|2008 general election]], Lazio gave 44.2% of its vote to the centre-right coalition, while the centre-left block took 41.4% of vote.

== Administrative divisions ==
Lazio is divided into five [[Italian province|provinces]]:

'''Lombardy''' ({{lang-it|Lombardia}} {{IPA-it|lombarˈdiːa}}, [[Western Lombard]]: ''Lumbardìa'', [[Eastern Lombard]]: ''Lombardia'') is one of the 20 [[regions of Italy]]. The capital is [[Milan]].

The official language, as in the rest of [[Italy]], is Italian. The traditional local languages are the various dialects of [[Lombard language|Lombard]] ([[Western Lombard]] and [[Eastern Lombard]]), as well as some dialects of [[Emilian language|Emilian]], spoken in some parts of the provinces of [[Province of Mantua|Mantua]], [[Province of Pavia|Pavia]], and [[Province of Cremona|Cremona]]. According to [[Istat]], almost 27% of Lombards are bilingual with Lombard and Italian languages; 9.1% are monolingual in Lombard and 57.6% are monolingual in Italian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istat.it/salastampa/comunicati/non_calendario/20070420_00/testointegrale.pdf La lingua italiana, i dialetti e le lingue stranieri]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
[[File:Lombardy.satellite.jpg|thumb|left|185px|Satellite image of Lombardy]]
Lombardy is bordered by [[Switzerland]] (north: [[Canton Ticino]] and [[Grisons|Canton Graubünden]]) and by the Italian regions of [[Emilia-Romagna]] (south), [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]] and the [[Veneto]] (east), and [[Piedmont]] (west). Three distinct natural zones can be fairly easily distinguished in the Lombardy region: mountains, hills and plains – the latter being divided in ''Alta'' (high plains) and ''Bassa'' (low plains).

The most important mountainous area is an Alpine zone including the [[Lepontine Alps|Lepontine]] and [[Rhaetian Alps]], (Piz Bernina – La Spedla, 4,020 m), the [[Bergamo Alps]], the [[Ortler Alps]] and the [[Adamello]] massif; it is followed by an Alpine foothills zone [[Prealpi Orobiche|Prealpi]], which include the main peaks are the Grigna Group (2,410 m), [[Resegone]] (1,875 m) and [[Presolana]] (2,521 m). The great Lombard lakes, all of glacial origin lie in this zone. From west to east these are [[Lake Maggiore]], [[Lake Lugano]] (only a small part is Italian), [[Lake Como]], [[Lake Iseo]], [[Lake Idro]], then [[Lake Garda]], the largest in Italy. South of the Alps lie the hills characterized by a succession of low heights of morainic origin, formed during the last [[Ice Age]] and small barely fertile plateaux, with typical heaths and conifer woods. A minor mountainous area lies south of the Po, in the [[Appennines]] range.

[[File:Orobie 5.jpg|thumb|right|290px|Panorama view: ''[[Bergamo Alps|Bergamasque Alps]]'']]

The plains of Lombardy, formed from alluvial deposits, can be divided into the ''Alta'' – an upper, permeable ground zone in the north and a lower zone characterized – the ''Bassa'' – by the so-called line of ''fontanili'' (the spring waters rising on impermeable ground). Anomalous compared with the three distinctions already made is the small region of the [[Oltrepò Pavese]], formed by the Apennine foothills beyond the Po River. A large number of rivers, all direct or indirect tributaries of the Po, cross the plains of Lombardy. Major rivers, flowing west to east, are the [[Ticino]], the outlet of [[Lake Maggiore]], the [[Olona]], the [[Lambro]], the [[Adda River|Adda]], outlet of [[Lake Como]], the [[Mincio]], outlet of [[Lake Garda]], and the [[Oglio]], the [[Lake Iseo]] outflow. There is a wide network of canals for irrigation purposes. In the plains, intensively cultivated for centuries, little of the original environment remains. The rare [[elm]], [[alder]], [[sycamore]], [[poplar]], [[willow]] and [[hornbeam]] woods and heaths are covered now by several protected areas. In the area of the great Alpine foothills lakes, however, grow olive trees, cypresses and larches, as well as varieties of subtropical flora such as magnolias, azaleas, acacias, etc. The mountains area is characterized by the typical vegetation of the whole range of the [[Italian Alps]]. At a lower levels (up to approximately 1,100 m) oak woods or broadleafed trees grow; on the mountain slopes (up to 2,000–2,200 m) beech trees grow at the lowest limits, with conifer woods higher up. Shrubs such as rhododendron, dwarf pine and juniper are native to the summital zone (beyond 2,200 m).

[[File:Le Lac Majeur.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Panorama view: ''[[Lake Maggiore]]'']]

The climate of this region is continental, though with variations depending on altitude or the presence of inland waters. The continental nature of the climate is more accentuated on the plains, with high annual temperature changes (at Milan an average January temperature is {{convert|1.5|°C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|24|°C|0|abbr=on}} in July), and thick fog between October and February. The Alpine foothills lakes exercise a mitigating influence, permitting the cultivation of typically Mediterranean produce (olives, citrus fruit). In the Alpine zone, the valley floor is relatively mild in contrast with the colder higher areas (Bormio, 1,225 m, {{convert|-1.4|°C|0|abbr=on}} average in January, {{convert|17.3|°C|0|abbr=on}} in July). Precipitations are more frequent in the [[Prealpi Orobiche|Prealpine]] zone (up to 1,500–2,000&amp;nbsp;mm annually) than on the plains and Alpine zones (600&amp;nbsp;mm to 850&amp;nbsp;mm annually). The numerous species of endemic flora (the Lombard native species), typical mainly of the Lake Como area, include some kinds of [[saxifrage]], the Lombard garlic, groundsels bellflowers and the cottony bellflowers. Lombardy counts many protected areas: the most important are the [[Stelvio National Park]] (the largest Italian natural park), with typically alpine wildlife: [[red deer]], roe-deer, [[ibex]], [[chamois]], foxes, [[ermine]] and also [[golden eagles]]; and the Ticino Valley Natural Park, instituted in 1974 on the Lombard side of the [[Ticino River]] to protect and conserve one of the last major examples of fluvial forest in [[Northern Italy]].

The area of current Lombardy was settled at least since the 2nd millennium BC, as shown by the archaeological findings of ceramics, arrows, axes and carved stones. In the following centuries it was inhabited by different peoples amongst whom the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], who founded the city of [[Mantua]] and spread the use of writing; later, starting from the 5th century BC, the area was invaded by [[Celts|Celtic]] – [[Gauls|Gallic]] tribes.  These people settled in several cities (including [[Milan]]) and extended their rule to the [[Adriatic]] Sea.  Their development was halted by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] expansion in the [[Po River|Po Valley]] from the 3rd century BC onwards: after centuries of struggle, in 194 BC the entire area of what is now Lombardy became a Roman province with the name of [[Gallia Cisalpina]] (&quot;[[Gaul]] on the nearer side of the [[Alps]]&quot;). The Roman culture and language overwhelmed the former civilization in the following years, and Lombardy became one of the most developed and rich areas of Italy with the construction of a wide array of roads and the development of agriculture and trade. Important figures like [[Pliny the Elder]] (in [[Como]]) and [[Virgil]] (in Mantua) were born here. In late antiquity the strategic role of Lombardy was emphasized by the temporary moving of the capital of the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]] to [[Mediolanum]] (Milan).  Here, in 313 AD, emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]] issued the famous edict that gave freedom of confession to all religions within the Empire.

[[File:Nuremberg chronicles f 147v 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alboin|King Alboin]] led the [[Lombards|Lombard]] migration into the [[Po Valley]] and made [[Pavia]] the capital]]

During and after the fall of the Western Empire, Lombardy suffered heavily from destruction brought about by a series of invasions by tribal peoples. The last and most effective was that of the [[Lombards]], or Longobardi, who came around 570s and whose long-lasting reign (whose capital was set in [[Pavia]]) gave the current name to the region. There was a close relationship between the [[Franks|Frankish]], Bavarian and Lombard nobility for many centuries. After the initial struggles, relationships between the Lombard people and the Latin-speaking people improved.  In the end, the Lombard language and culture assimilated with the Latin culture, leaving evidence in many names, the legal code and laws among other things. The end of Lombard rule came in 774, when the [[Franks|Frankish]] king [[Charlemagne]] conquered Pavia and annexed the [[The Kingdom of the Lombards|Kingdom of Italy]] (mostly northern and central Italy) to his empire.  The former Lombard dukes and nobles were replaced by other German vassals, prince-bishops or marquises. The 11th century marked a significant boom in the region's economy, due to improved trading and, mostly, agricultural conditions. In a similar way to other areas of Italy, this led to a growing self-acknowledgement of the cities, whose increasing richness made them able to defy the traditional feudal supreme power, represented by the German emperors and their local legates. This process reached its apex in the 12th and 13th centuries, when different [[Lombard League]]s formed by allied cities of Lombardy, usually led by Milan, managed to defeat the [[Hohenstaufen]] Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa|Frederick I]], at [[Battle of Legnano|Legnano]], and his grandson [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], at [[Battle of Parma|Parma]].

[[File:GGVCiSAdM.png|thumb|left|205px|The Coronation ceremony of&lt;BR&gt;[[Gian Galeazzo Visconti]] in the&lt;BR&gt;[[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]]]]

This did not prevent other important Lombard centres, like [[Cremona]] (then rivalling Milan for size and wealth) and others, from supporting the imperial power if this could grant them an immediate advantage. Taking advantage of the flourishing agriculture, the area around the [[Po River]], together with [[Venice]] and [[Tuscany]], continued to expand its industry and commerce until it became the economic centre of the whole of Europe. The enterprising class of the communes extended its trade and banking activities well into northern Europe: &quot;Lombard&quot; designated the merchant or banker coming from northern Italy (see, for instance, [[Lombard Street, London|Lombard Street]] in London). The name &quot;Lombardy&quot; came to designate the whole of Northern Italy until the 15th century and sometimes later. From the 14th century onwards, the instability created by the unceasing internal and external struggles ended in the creation of noble seignories, the most significant of which were those of the [[House of Visconti|Viscontis]] (later [[House of Sforza|Sforzas]]) in Milan and of the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzagas]] in Mantua. In the 15th century the [[Duchy of Milan]] was a major political, economical and military force at the European level. Milan and Mantua became two centres of the [[Renaissance]] whose culture, with men like [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], and pieces of art were highly regarded (for example, Leonardo da Vinci's ''[[The Last Supper]]''). This richness, however, attracted the now more organized armies of national powers like France and Austria, which waged a lengthy battle for Lombardy in the late 15th-early 16th century.

===Modern era===

[[File:Monza-palace.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Historical image of [[Villa Reale di Monza]], official summer residence of the Austrian viceroys of Lombardy-Venetia, part of [[Austrian Empire]]]]
After the decisive [[Battle of Pavia]], the Duchy of Milan became a possession of the [[Habsburgs]] of Spain: the new rulers did little to improve the economy of Lombardy, instead imposing a growing series of taxes needed to support their unending series of European wars. [[File:Pirelli T1.png|thumb|right|200px|The [[Pirelli Tower]] under construction in Milan, symbol of the post-war [[Italian economic miracle]] of 1950-60s.]] The eastern part of modern Lombardy, with cities like [[Bergamo]] and [[Brescia]], was under the [[Republic of Venice]], which had begun to extend its influence in the area from the 14th century onwards (''see also [[Italian Wars]]'').  Pestilences (like that of 1628/1630,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.storiadimilano.it/Personaggi/Milanesi%20illustri/mora.htm From an italian website a brief history of the pestilence]&lt;/ref&gt; described by [[Alessandro Manzoni]] in his ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|I Promessi Sposi]]'') and the generally declining conditions of Italy's economy in the 17th and 18th centuries halted the further development of Lombardy. In 1706 the [[Austrian Empire|Austrians]] came to power and introduced some economical and social measures which granted a certain recovery. Their rule was smashed in the late 18th century by the French armies, however, and with the [[formation of the Napoleonic Empire]], Lombardy became one of the semi-independent province of Napoleonic France. The restoration of Austrian rule in 1815, in the form of the puppet state called [[Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia]], had however to contend with new social ideals introduced by the Napoleonic era. Lombardy became one of the intellectual centres leading to [[Italian unification]]. The popular republic of 1848 was short-lived, its suppression leading to renewed Austrian rule. This came to a decisive end when Lombardy was annexed to the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] 1859 as a result of the [[Second Italian Independence War]]. When annexed to the Kingdom of Italy in 1859 Lombardy achieved its actual territorial shape by adding the [[Oltrepò Pavese]] (formerly southern part of [[Novara]]'s Province) to the province of [[Pavia]]. Starting from the late 19th century, and with a boom after World War II, Lombardy sharpened its status of richest and most industrialized region of Italy.

One sixth of the Italian population or about 10 million people live in Lombardy (16.2% of the national population; 2% of the [[European Union]] population), making it the second most densely populated region in Italy after [[Campania]] with a strong concentration in the [[Milan]] metropolitan area and the Alpine foothills areas of the provinces of [[Varese]], [[Como]], [[Lecco]], [[Province of Monza e Brianza|Monza and Brianza]] and [[Bergamo]], (1,200 inh./km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), a lower average density (250 inh./km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in the [[Padan Plain|Po]] valley and the lower [[Brescia]] valleys, and much lower densities (less than 60 inh./km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in the northern mountain areas and the southern [[Oltrepò Pavese]] subregion.

The growth of the regional population was particularly sustained during the 1950s–60s, thanks to a prolonged economic boom, high birth rates, and strong immigration flows (especially from [[Southern Italy]]). During the last two decades, Lombardy became the destination of a large number of international immigrants, insomuch that today more than a quarter of all foreign immigrants in Italy lives in this region. As of 2008, the Italian national institute of statistics ISTAT estimated that 815,335 foreign-born immigrants live in Lombardy, equal to 8.4% of the total regional population.

The primary religion is Catholicism; significative religious minorities include Christian [[Waldenses]], Protestants and [[Eastern Christianity|Orthodox]], as well as Jews, [[Sikh]] and Muslims.

== Economy ==
[[File:Panorama of Milan from Palazzo Lombardia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|300px|View over the business district of Milan: with a metropolitan area of 7.4m people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://213.253.134.43/oecd/pdfs/browseit/0406041E.PDF|format=PDF|title=Competitive Cities in the Global Economy|author=OECD|accessdate=30 April 2009|authorlink=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is Italy's most important industrial, commercial and financial center.]]

The gross domestic product in Lombardia (equal to over €328 billion  in 2008) accounts for 20% of the total gross domestic product of Italy. When this measure is considered by inhabitant, it results in a value of €31,600 per inhabitant, which is almost 25% higher than the national average of €24,300.&lt;ref name=&quot;epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu&quot;&gt;[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/PGP_PRD_CAT_PREREL/PGE_CAT_PREREL_YEAR_2008/PGE_CAT_PREREL_YEAR_2008_MONTH_02/1-12022008-EN-AP.PDF]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lombardy's development has been marked by the growth of the services sector since the 1980s, and in particular by the growth of innovative activities in the sector of services to enterprises and in credit and financial services. At the same time, the strong industrial vocation of the region has not suffered from it. Lombardy remains, in fact, the main industrial area of the country. The presence, and development, of a very high number of enterprises belonging to the services sector represents a favourable situation for the improvement of the efficiency of the productive process, as well as for the growth of the regional economy. Lombardy is one of the [[Four Motors for Europe]]. 

The region can broadly be divided into three areas as regards the productive activity. Milan, where the services sector makes up for 65.3% of the employment; a group of provinces, Varese, Como, Lecco, Bergamo and Brescia, highly industrialised, although in the two latter ones, in the plains, there is also a rich agricultural sector. Finally, in the provinces of Sondrio, Pavia, Cremona, Mantova and Lodi, there is a consistent agricultural activity, and at the same time an above average development of the services sector. [[File:San Martino della Battaglia Panorama 001.JPG|thumb|300px|The countryside around [[Lake Garda]].]]The productivity of agriculture is enhanced by a well-developed use of fertilizers and the traditional abundance of water, boosted since the Middle Ages by the construction (partly designed by Leonardo da Vinci) of a wide net of irrigation systems. Lower plains are characterized by fodder crops, which are mowed up to eight times a years, cereals (rice, wheat and maize) and sugarbeet. Productions of the higher plains include cereals, vegetables, fruit trees and mulberries. The higher areas, up to the [[Prealpi Orobiche|Prealps]] and [[Alps]] sectors of the north, produce fruit and vines. Cattle (with the highest density in Italy), pigs and sheep are raised.

Following a steep decline in GDP during the global recession in 2009 which saw industry heavily hit, Lombardy's economy is predicted to outperform the Italian economy this year with growth of between 1–1.3% expected. Only Emilia Romagna, Lazio and Tuscany are expected to outperform the region in 2010. The revival of the industrial sector is an important factor, but it is the service sector – and especially the financial sector which will drive the Lombard economy to a sustainable recovery.

== Government and politics ==

[[File:PalazzoLombardia2.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Palazzo Lombardia]] in Milan, seat of the regional government.]]

{{Main|Politics of Lombardy}}
The politics of Lombardy take place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy]], whereby the President of the Region (''Presidente della Regione'') is the [[head of government]], and of a pluriform [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the Regional Government (''Giunta Regionale''). [[Legislative power]] is vested in the [[Regional Council of Lombardy|Regional Council]] (''Consiglio Regionale'').

The [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]] maintained a large majority of the popular support and the control of the most important cities and provinces since the birth of the Italian Republic until the late 1980s. The [[Italian Communist Party]] was a considerable presence only in the eastern and southern parts of Lombardy from the late 1960s to the mid 1980's. Their base however was increasingly eroded by the [[Italian Socialist Party]] until, in the early 1990s, the ''[[Mani Pulite]]'' corruption scandal which spread from Milan to the whole of Italy wiped away the old political class almost entirely. This, together with the general disaffection towards Rome's government (considered as favouring excessively the less developed regions of southern Italy in economical matters), led to the sudden growth of the secessionist (later [[Lega Nord|Northern League]]), that is particularly strong in mountain and rural areas. In recent years, Lombardy stayed as a conservative stronghold, that gave about 60 per cent of its votes to [[Silvio Berlusconi]] at the last [[Italian general election, 2008|general election]]. Notwithstanding, the capital city of Milan landslide elected a new [[Giuliano Pisapia|progressive mayor]] at the 2011 municipal elections.

==Culture==

{{Ref improve section|date=November 2010}}

Although Lombardy as a region is often identified as merely an economic and industrial powerhouse, it has interesting examples [http://www.lombardiadautore.regione.lombardia.it] even from the standpoint of cultural and artistic. The many examples range from [[prehistory]] to the present day, through the Roman period and the Renaissance and can be found both in museums and churches that enrich cities and towns around the region.

===Prehistory===

[[File:Scena di duello R6 - Foppe - Nadro (Foto Luca Giarelli).jpg|left|thumb|175px|Rock engraves, [[Nadro]].]]

The rock carvings (some 300,000) left by the ancient Camuni in the [[Valcamonica]] depicting animals, people and symbols date back to the period from [[Neolithic]] to [[Middle Ages]].

The many artifacts (pottery, personal items and weapons) found in the necropolis near the [[Lake Maggiore]], and [[Ticino]] demonstrate the presence of civilization Golasecca who lived in Western Lombardy between the ninth and the fourth century BC.

===Museums===

Lombardy contains numerous museums (over 330) of different types: ethnographic, historical, technical-scientific, artistic and naturalistic which testify to the historical-cultural and artistic development of the region. Among the most famous are the National Museum of Science and Technology &quot;Leonardo da Vinci&quot; (Milan), the [[The Last Supper]] of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (Milan), the [[Accademia Carrara]] (Bergamo), the [[Museum of Santa Giulia]] (Brescia), the Volta Temple (Como), the Stradivari Museum (Cremona), the [[Palazzo Te]] (Mantua), the  Museum Sacred Art of the Nativity and the basilica of Santa Maria Assunta at  [[Gandino]], the [[Royal Villa of Monza]] and many others.

===Cuisine===
{{main|Lombard cuisine}}
Rice is popular in the region, often found in soups as well as ''risotti'', such as '''&quot;risotto alla Milanese'''&quot;, with [[saffron]]. In the city of [[Monza]] a popular recipe also adds pieces of sausages to the risotto. Regional cheeses include ''[[robiola]]'', ''[[crescenza]]'', ''[[Taleggio (cheese)|taleggio]]'', ''[[Gorgonzola (cheese)|gorgonzola]]'' and ''[[grana padano]]'' (the plains of central and southern Lombardy allow intensive cattle-raising). Butter and [[cream]] are used. Single pot dishes, which take less work to prepare, are popular. In [[Bergamo]], [[Brescia]], and [[Valtellina]], [[polenta]] is common. In Valtellina, [[Pizzoccheri]] too. In [[Mantua]] festivals feature ''tortelli di zucca'' ([[ravioli]] with pumpkin filling) accompanied by melted butter and followed by [[turkey]] stuffed with chicken or other stewed meats.&lt;ref&gt;Piras, 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
[[File:Teatro Grande (Sala).jpg|thumb|200px|left|The magnificent auditorium of the Teatro Grande in Brescia.]]
{{Main|Music of Lombardy|Music of Milan}}
Besides Milan, the region of Lombardy has 11 other provinces, most of them with equally great musical traditions. Bergamo is famous for being the birthplace of [[Gaetano Donizetti]] and home of the Teatro Donizetti; Brescia is hosts the impressive 1709 Teatro Grande; Cremona is regarded as the birthplace of the commonly used violin, and is home to several of the most prestigious [[luthier]]s in the world, and Mantua was one of the founding and most important cities in 16th and 17th opera and classical music. Other cities such as Lecco, Lodi, Varese and Pavia also have rich musical traditions, but Milan is the hub and centre of the Lombard musical scene. It was the birthplace of [[Giuseppe Verdi]], one of the most famous and influential opera composers of the 19th century, and boasts a variety of acclaimed theatres, such as the Piccolo Teatro and the Teatro Arcimboldi; however, the most famous is the 1778 [[Teatro alla Scala]], one of the most important and prestigious operahouses in the world.

===Language===
{{Main|Lombard language|Western Lombard|Eastern Lombard}}
{{See also|Western Lombard literature|Western Lombard writers|Plural inflection in Western Lombard}}
Apart from standardized Italian, [[Lombard language|Lombard]] is the local language of Lombardy. Lombard is a member of the [[Gallo-Italic]] group within the [[Romance languages]]. It is spoken natively in Northern [[Italy]] (most of Lombardy and some areas of neighbouring regions, notably the eastern side of [[Piedmont]]) and Southern [[Switzerland]] ([[Ticino]] and [[Graubünden]]).

The two main varieties ([[Western Lombard language]] and [[Eastern Lombard language]]) show differences and are often, but not always, mutually comprehensible. The union of [[Western Lombard|Western Lombard or Insubric]], [[Eastern Lombard]] and intermediate varieties under the denomination of &quot;Lombard&quot; is a matter of debate, and it has been argued that the two might potentially form separate languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=lmo |title=Ethnologue report for language code:lmo |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fashion===
{{Main|Fashion in Milan}}
Lombardy has always been an important centre for silk and textile production, notably the cities of [[Pavia]], [[Vigevano]] and [[Cremona]], but [[Milan]] is the region's most important centre for clothing and high fashion. In 2009, Milan was regarded as the world [[fashion capital]], even surpassing New York, Paris, Rome and London.&lt;ref name=&quot;languagemonitor.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.languagemonitor.com/popular-culture/fashion |title=The Global Language Monitor » Fashion |publisher=Languagemonitor.com |date=20 July 2009 |accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the major [[Italian fashion]] brands, such as [[Valentino SpA|Valentino]], [[Versace]], [[Prada]], [[Armani]] and [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]] (to name a few), are currently headquartered in the city.

== Administrative divisions ==
Lombardy is divided into 12 provinces:

'''Marco Follini''' (born on 26 September 1954) is an Italian centre-wing &lt;!--ABSOLUTELY NOT LEFT WING--&gt;politician.

Follini was born in [[Rome]]. He was National Secretary of the [[Democrats' Centre Union]] party until October 15, 2005.  He was also Vice-Prime Minister of [[Silvio Berlusconi|Berlusconi]]'s second government, taking office up to April 2005.

A former member of the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] party, he then joined the UDC, and became national party leader in 2002, succeeding  [[Pierferdinando Casini]], after the latter's election as President of the [[Chamber of Deputies]].  He unexpectedly resigned from his UDC leader position on October 15, 2005, following the approval of a new proportional electoral law by the ruling coalition the House of Freedoms, stating this was not the electoral law he actually wished.

Elected in the [[Italian general election, 2006|2006 general election]] as Senator, he, along with [[Bruno Tabacci]] continued to show his disagreement of Berlusconi's leadership in the House of Freedoms.  Follini also clashed with the rest of his party on several occasions, supporting, again with [[Bruno Tabacci]]'s support, [[Giorgio Napolitano]]'s candidacy in the [[Italian presidential election, 2006|presidential election]] and successfully campaigning in opposition to the constitutional reform approved by the House of Freedoms in 2005, then cancelled by a referendum.

On October 18, 2006, Follini officially left UDC, and announced the foundation of a new centrist movement, called [[Middle-of-the-Road Italy]] (''Italia di Mezzo'').  On February 24, 2007, after President [[Giorgio Napolitano]] sent the resigning Prodi cabinet to the Senate for a confidence vote, Marco Follini announced he would vote in favour of it.

On May 22, 2007, he was appointed a member of the organizing committee of the embryonic centre-left [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Nasce il Comitato promotore del Pd.

'''Mario Monti''' ({{IPA-it|ˈmaːrjo ˈmonti}}; born 19 March 1943), also known as ''Il Professore'' ('The Professor'), is the [[List of Prime Ministers of Italy|54th]] and current [[Prime Minister of Italy]] and also the [[List of Italian Ministers of Economy and Finance|Minister of Economy and Finance]].  Monti became Prime Minister when on 12 November 2011, in the midst of the [[European sovereign debt crisis]], he was invited by [[President of Italy|President]] [[Giorgio Napolitano]] to form a new [[technocracy|technocratic]] government (in Italian, ''governo tecnico'')&lt;!-- ***************************please note that the &quot;technocray&quot; wikipedia article to which &quot;technocratic&quot; links to is not exactly what a &quot;Governo Tecnico&quot; is. Maybe a whole new article called &quot;Technical government (Italy) is needed. Infact the &quot;technocracy article&quot; starts with these words: &quot;Technocracy is a hypothetical form of government in which science would be in control of all decision making. Scientists, engineers and technologists who have knowledge, expertise or skills would compose the governing body, instead of politicians, businessmen and economists.&quot; ... and Monti is an economists! So it doesn't really make sense IMHO. Thanks. ***************************--&gt; following the [[resignation of Silvio Berlusconi]]. Monti was sworn in as Prime Minister on 16 November 2011, just a week after having been appointed a [[Senator for life|Senator for Life]].

Monti is also an [[economist]] and academic who previously served as a [[European Commissioner]] from 1995 to 2004, with responsibility for the [[European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services|Internal Market, Services]], [[European Commissioner for Taxation and Customs Union, Audit and Anti-Fraud|Customs and Taxation]] from 1995 to 1999 and then for [[European Commissioner for Competition|Competition]] from 1999 to 2004.

==European Commissioner==

[[File:Mario monti.gif|thumb|left|Mario Monti served as a [[European Commissioner]] from 1994 to 2004.]]

===Santer Commission===
In 1994, Monti was appointed to the [[Santer Commission]], along with [[Emma Bonino]], by the first [[Silvio Berlusconi]] cabinet. In his office as a [[European Commissioner]] from 1994 to 1999, he was responsible for Internal Market, Financial Services and Financial Integration, Customs, and Taxation. His work with the commission has earned him the nickname &quot;Super Mario&quot; from his colleagues and from the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/11/world/europe/italy-mario-monti-profile/index.html|title=Who is Italy's 'Super Mario' Monti?|author=Smith-Spark, Laura| publisher = [[CNN]] |date=13 November 2011|accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prodi Commission===
In 1999, Prime Minister [[Massimo D'Alema]] confirmed his appointment to the new [[Prodi Commission]] and he was given one of the most powerful positions at the Commission, [[European Commissioner for Competition|Competition Commissioner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/letter_from_america/3921303.stm | title=Examining the EU executive | publisher=BBC News | date=23 July 2004 | accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

As Competition Commissioner Monti led the investigation into a number of high profile and controversial mergers, including: [[Scania AB]] &amp; [[Volvo]] (1999),&lt;ref name=&quot;EuroVoice 23032000&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/imported/monti-puts-brakes-on-eu-merger-mania/40395.aspx | title=Monti puts brakes on EU merger mania | publisher=European Voice | date=23 March 2000 | accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MCI Inc.|WorldCom]] &amp; [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]] (2000),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1033-243110.html | title=Sprint, WorldCom call off $120 billion merger | publisher=CNet News | date=13 July 2000 | accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[General Electric]] &amp; [[Honeywell]] (2001), [[Schneider Electric]] &amp; [[Legrand (company)|Legrand]] (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.economist.com/node/814366 | title=A shocking denouement | publisher=The Economist | date=11 October 2001 | accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Carnival Corporation &amp; plc|Carnival Corporation]] &amp; [[P&amp;O Ferries]] (2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2002/jul/25/12 | title=EU backs Carnival bid for P&amp;O | publisher=The Guardian | date=25 July 2002 | accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His term in office also saw the [[European Court of Justice]], for the first time, overrule the Commission's decision to block a merger in three separate cases, although two were decided by his predecessor.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Full Monti&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/The-full-Monti/2100-1016_3-5178159.html | title=The full Monti | publisher=CNet News | date=24 March 2004 | accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Monti was also responsible for levying the EU's largest ever fine at the time (€497 million) against [[Microsoft]] for abusing its dominant market position in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/3563697.stm | title=Microsoft hit by record EU fine | publisher=BBC News | date=24 March 2004 | accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Monti was criticised in the media and by competition lawyers for the perceived inflexibility of the merger oversight process and the high number of cases that were being blocked.&lt;ref name=&quot;EuroVoice 23032000&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.economist.com/node/387773 | title=Spaghetti Monti | publisher=The Economist | date=5 October 2000 | accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC 011102&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2385037.stm | title=Mario Monti: Merger man on a mission | publisher=BBC News | date=1 November 2002 | accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 1 November 2002, Monti responding to the European Court of Justice's ruling which reversed his decision to block the merger between [[Airtours International Airways|Airtours]] &amp; First Choice Holidays said, ''&quot;Last week was a tough week for the Commission's merger control policy - and of course for me.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC 011102&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Full Monti&quot; /&gt;  This ruling in combination with his decision to block the General Electric &amp; Honeywell merger led to criticism in the United States against both the Commission's procedures and accusations that Monti's decisions were politically motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.economist.com/node/905116 | title=Monti braves the catcalls | publisher=The Economist | date=13 December 2001 | accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Monti, however, was defended by supporters who saw his actions as an important step in the development of competition law in the EU.  Dan Rubinfeld, economics professor at the [[University of California]] who worked on the US Justice Department's antitrust case against Microsoft, said of Monti, ''&quot;There has been a lot of talk of politics in this and other cases, but I believe he has been driven entirely by the desire to do the right thing.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;The Full Monti&quot; /&gt;   

On 11 December 2002, Monti proposed a series of reforms to the EU's merger rules and made structural changes within the Commission's Competition department which aimed to improve transparency for companies throughout the merger review process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/imported/monti-unveils-merger-reform-proposals-based-on-us-model/46333.aspx | title=Monti unveils merger reform proposals based on US model | publisher=European Voice | date=12 December 2002 | accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reforms were adopted by the EU as [[European Union merger law|Regulation 139/2004 (known as ECMR).]]

In 2004, Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]] returned to power in Italy and did not re-appoint Monti to the [[Barroso Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15695056 | title=Profile: Mario Monti | publisher=BBC News | date=13 November 2011 | accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Austerity measures===
On 4 December 2011, Monti's government introduced emergency austerity measures intended to stem the worsening economic conditions in Italy and restore market confidence, especially after rising [[European_sovereign_debt_crisis#Italy|Italian government bond yields]] began to threaten Italy's financial stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-28/italy-set-for-a-sizeable-cost-increase-at-8-billion-euro-bond-auction.html | title=Related News:Europe  · Italy  · Bonds .Italy Pays More Than 7% at Treasury-Bond Auction for Third Time in a Week | publisher=Bloomberg | date=29 November 2011 | accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The austerity package called for increased taxes, pension reform and measures to fight tax evasion.

===Labour market reforms===
On 20 January 2012, Monti's government formally adopted a package of reforms targeting Italy's labour market.  The reforms are intended to open certain professions (such as taxi drivers, pharmacists, doctors, lawyers and notaries) to more competition by reforming their licensing systems and abolishing minimum tariffs for their services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16653863 | title=Italy approves sweeping reforms | publisher=BBC News | date=20 January 2012 | accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b13df170-4392-11e1-adda-00144feab49a.html#axzz1mFlcNTKs | title=Monti unveils liberalisation plans | publisher=Financial Times | date=20 January 2012 | accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Article 18 of Italy's labour code, which requires companies that employ 15 or more workers to re-hire (rather than compensate) any employee found to have been fired without just cause,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.economist.com/node/1205271 | title=Berlusconi 2, Cofferati 1 | publisher=The Economist | date=27 June 2002 | accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters 020212&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/02/us-italy-reforms-idUSTRE8111TF20120202 | title=Italy govt to pass labour reforms even without unions | publisher=Reuters | date=2 February 2012 | accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; would also be reformed.

The city proper has a population of about 1.3 million, while its urban area, roughly coinciding with its administrative [[Province of Milan|province]] and the bordering [[Province of Monza and Brianza]] (created in 2004 splitting the northern part from the province of Milan itself), is one of Europe's largest with an estimated population of over 4 million spread over {{convert|1980|km²|2|abbr=on}}, with a consequent population density of more than 2,000 inhabitants/km².&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.demographia.com/db-worldua.pdf |title=Demographia: World Urban Areas |format=PDF |accessdate=19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of many suburbs and satellite settlements around the city proper following the great [[Italian economic miracle|economic boom of the 1950s–60s]] and massive commuting flows suggest that socioeconomic linkages have expanded well beyond the boundaries of the city proper and its agglomeration, creating a [[metropolitan area]] of 7.4 million population expanded all over the central section of [[Lombardy]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecdbookshop.org/oecd/get-it.asp?REF=0406051E.PDF&amp;TYPE=browse |title=OECD Territorial Review – Milan, Italy |accessdate=19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbact.eu/fileadmin/subsites/Metrogov/pdf/Milan_s2.pdf Competitiveness of Milan and its metropolitan area]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the [[Milan metropolitan area]] is part of the so-called ''[[Blue Banana]]'', the area of Europe with the highest population and industrial density.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gert&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Gert-Jan Hospers|year=2002|title=Beyond the Blue Banana?

The city was founded by the [[Insubres]], a [[Celts|Celtic]] people.
Milan was later captured by the Romans in 222 BC, and later was the capital city of the [[Western Roman Empire]] from 286 until 402 AD. Milan became one of the most prosperous Italian cities during the [[High Middle Ages]], playing a primary role in the [[Lombard League]]. Later Milan became the capital city of the [[Duchy of Milan]], being ruled by the [[House of Visconti|Visconti]], the [[House of Sforza|Sforza]], the [[Kingdom of Spain|Spanish]] and the [[Austrian Empire|Austria]]ns. In 1796, Milan was conquered by the French troops of [[Napoleon I]], who made it the capital of the puppet state of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] in 1805.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Britannica Concise Encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/382069/Milan#|title=Milan (Italy) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia|publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;World&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldtravelguide.net/city/82/city_guide/Europe/Milan.html |title=Milan Travel Guide |publisher=www.worldtravelguide.net |accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Milan became the capital city of the [[Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia]], which was part of the [[Austrian Empire]]. In 1859 the city was unified with the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], which later became the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]]. During the [[Romanticism|Romantic period]], Milan was a major cultural centre in Europe, attracting several artists, composers and important literary figures. Later, during World War II, the city was badly affected by Allied bombings, and after German occupation in 1943, Milan became the main hub of the Italian resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt; Despite this, Milan saw a post-war economic growth, attracting thousands of immigrants from Southern Italy and abroad.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt;

Over the years, Milan has had an increase in the number of international inhabitants, and 15.2% of Milan's population is foreign born.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official ISTAT estimates&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demo.istat.it/str2008/index.html |title=Official ISTAT estimates |publisher=Demo.istat.it |accessdate=19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city remains one of Europe's main transportation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/italy/milan |title=Milan, Italy – Milan Travel Guide |publisher=Sacred-destinations.com |accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and industrial hubs, and Milan is the EU's 10th most important centre for business and finance (2009)&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.citymayors.com/business/euro_bizcities.html&quot;&gt;[http://www.citymayors.com/business/euro_bizcities.html Best European business cities].

Inhabitants of Milan are referred to as &quot;Milanese&quot; (Italian: {{lang|it|''Milanesi''}} or informally {{lang|it|''Meneghini''}} or {{lang|it|''Ambrosiani''}}). Milan, for its pivotal economic role and its fervent political and cultural activity that often anticipates national trends, it is often nicknamed as the ''&quot;moral capital of Italy&quot;''.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt;

==History==
{{See also|List of rulers of Milan|List of Governors of the Duchy of Milan}}

===Etymology===
The English name ''Milan'' derives from the Lombard and the Italian form is ''Milano'', which stems from the Latin [[Mediolanum]], the ancient city founded by the Celtic tribe of the [[Insubres]], that was in possession of the city until the Roman conquest in the 2nd century BC.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}. The Mediolanum name is borne by a number of Gallo-Roman sites in France, such as [[Mediolanum Santonum]] (Saintes) and [[Mediolanum Aulercorum]] (Évreux) and appears to contain the Celtic element -lan, signifying an enclosure or demarcated territory (source of the Welsh word 'llan', meaning a sanctuary or church). Hence, ''Mediolanum'' could signify the central town or sanctuary of a particular [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribe]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}&lt;ref name=&quot;World&quot;/&gt;

The origin of the name and of a [[Wild boar|boar]] (the ''[[scrofa semilanuta]]'') as a symbol of the city are fancifully accounted for in [[Andrea Alciato]]'s ''Emblemata'' (1584), beneath a woodcut of the first raising of the [[Defensive wall|city walls]], where a boar is seen lifted from the excavation, and the etymology of ''Mediolanum'' given as &quot;half-wool&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''medius'' + ''lanum''; Alciato's &quot;etymology&quot; is intentionally far-fetched.&lt;/ref&gt; explained in Latin and in French. The foundation of Milan is credited to two [[Celts|Celtic peoples]], the [[Bituriges]] and the [[Aedui]], having as their [[emblem]]s a ram and a boar;&lt;ref&gt;''Bituricis vervex, Heduis dat sucula signum.''&lt;/ref&gt; therefore &quot;The city's symbol is a wool-bearing boar, an animal of double form, here with sharp bristles, there with sleek wool.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Laniger huic signum sus est, animálque biforme, Acribus hinc setis, lanitio inde levi.''&lt;/ref&gt; Alciato credits [[Ambrose]] for his account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk/french/emblem.php?id=FALc002 |title=Alciato, '&amp;#39;Emblemata'&amp;#39;, Emblema II |publisher=Emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk |accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Celtic and Roman times===
{{Main|Mediolanum}}
[[File:Ruins-imperial-complex-milan-.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of the Emperor's palace in Milan. Here [[Constantine I]] and [[Licinius]] issued the [[Edict of Milan]].]]
Around 400 BC, the Celtic [[Insubres]] inhabited Milan and the surrounding region. In 222 BC, the Romans conquered this settlement, which was then called [[Mediolanum]]. After several centuries of Roman control, Milan was declared the capital of the [[Western Roman Empire]] by Emperor [[Diocletian]] in 293 AD. Diocletian chose to stay in the Eastern Roman Empire (capital [[Nicomedia]]) and his colleague Maximianus ruled the Western one. Immediately [[Maximian]] built several gigantic monuments, like a large circus {{convert|470|x|85|m|ft|lk=out|abbr=on}}, the Thermae Herculeae, a large complex of imperial palaces and several other services and buildings.

In the [[Edict of Milan]] of 313, Emperor [[Constantine I]] guaranteed [[freedom of religion]] for Christians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edict&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/1990/issue28/2809.html |title=313 The Edict of Milan|Christian History |publisher=www.christianitytoday.com |accessdate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was besieged by the [[Visigoths]] in 402, and the imperial residence was moved to [[Ravenna]]. Fifty years later (in 452), the [[Huns]] overran the city. In 539, the [[Ostrogoths]] conquered and destroyed Milan in the course of the so-called [[Gothic War (535–554)|Gothic War]] against [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Justinian I]]. In the summer of 569, the [[Lombards|Longobards]] (from which the name of the Italian region [[Lombardy]] derives), a [[Teutons|Teutoic tribe]] conquered Milan (Which is one of the reasons why a high percentage of Milanese are [[Nordics|Nordic]] gened), overpowering the small [[Byzantine army]] left for its defence. Some Roman structures remained in use in Milan under Lombard rule.&lt;ref&gt;See the ''[[Versum de Mediolano civitate]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Milan surrendered to the [[Franks]] in 774 when [[Charlemagne]], in an utterly novel decision, took the title &quot;King of the Lombards&quot; as well (before then the Germanic kingdoms had frequently conquered each other, but none had adopted the title of King of another people). The [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] dates from this period. Subsequently Milan was part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Nuremberg chronicles f 72r 1.png|thumb|Milan as it appeared in 1493, woodcut from the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]].]]

During [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]], Milan prospered as a centre of trade due to its command of the rich plain of the Po and routes from Italy across the Alps. The war of conquest by [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I Barbarossa]] against the Lombard cities brought the destruction of much of Milan in 1162. After the founding of the [[Lombard League]] in 1167, Milan took the leading role in this alliance. As a result of the independence that the Lombard cities gained in the [[Peace of Constance]] in 1183, Milan became a duchy. In 1208 [[Rambertino Buvalelli]] served a term as [[podestà]] of the city, in 1242 [[Luca Grimaldi]], and in 1282 [[Luchetto Gattilusio]]. The position could be fraught with personal dangers in the violent political life of the [[medieval commune]]: in 1252 Milanese heretics assassinated the Church's Inquisitor, later known as [[Peter of Verona|Saint Peter Martyr]], at a ford in the nearby ''contado''; the killers bribed their way to freedom, and in the ensuing riot the ''podestà'' was very nearly lynched. In 1256 the archbishop and leading nobles were expelled from the city. In 1259 [[Martino della Torre]] was elected ''Capitano del Popolo'' by members of the [[guild]]s; he took the city by force, expelled his enemies, and ruled by dictatorial powers, paving streets, digging canals, successfully taxing the countryside. His policy, however, brought the Milanese treasury to collapse; the use of often reckless mercenary units further angered the population, granting an increasing support for the Della Torre's traditional enemies, the Visconti. It is worthy of note that the most important industries throughout the period were major armaments and wool production, a whole catalogue of activities and trades is given in Bonvesin della Riva's &quot;de Magnalibus Urbis Mediolani&quot;.

[[File:IMG 3734 - Milano - Stemma visconteo- sull'Arcivescovado - Foto di Giovanni Dall'Orto - 15-jan-2007.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The ''[[Biscione]]'': the coat of arms of the House of Visconti, from the Archbishops' palace in [[Piazza del Duomo, Milan|Piazza Duomo]].]]

On 22 July 1262 [[Ottone Visconti]] was created [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|archbishop of Milan]] by [[Pope Urban IV]], against the Della Torre candidate, Raimondo della Torre, [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Como|Bishop of Como]]. The latter thus started to publicize allegations of the Visconti's closeness to the heretic [[Catharism|Cathars]] and charged them of high treason: the Visconti, who accused the Della Torre of the same crimes, were then banned from Milan and their properties confiscated. The ensuing civil war caused more damage to Milan's population and economy, lasting for more than a decade. Ottone Visconti unsuccessfully led a group of exiles against the city in 1263, but after years of escalating violence on all sides, finally, after the victory in the [[Battle of Desio]] (1277), he won the city for his family. The [[House of Visconti|Visconti]] succeeded in ousting the [[della Torre]] forever, ruling the city and its possession until the 15th century.

Much of the prior history of Milan was the tale of the struggle between two political factions—the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelphs and the Ghibellines]]. Most of the time the Guelphs were successful in the city of Milan. However, the Visconti family were able to seize power (signoria) in Milan, based on their &quot;Ghibelline&quot; friendship with the German Emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Henry S. Lucas, ''The Renaissance and the Reformation'' (Harper &amp; Bros.: New York, 1960) p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1395, one of these emperors, Wenceslas (1378–1400), raised the Milanese to the dignity of a duchy.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1395, [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti]] became duke of Milan. The Ghibelline Visconti family was to retain power in Milan for a century and a half from the early 14th century until the middle of the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Hoyt &amp; Stanley Chodorow ''Europe in the Middle Ages'' (Harcourt, Brace &amp; Jovanovich: New York, 1976) p. 614.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1447 [[Filippo Maria Visconti]], [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], died without a male heir; following the end of the Visconti line, the [[Golden Ambrosian Republic|Ambrosian Republic]] was enacted. The Ambrosian Republic took its name from St. Ambrose, popular patron saint of the city of Milan.&lt;ref name=&quot;lucas:268&quot;&gt;Henry S. Lucas, ''The Renaissance and the Reformation'' p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Guelph and the Ghibelline factions worked together to bring about the Ambrosian Republic in Milan. However, the Republic collapsed when in 1450, Milan was conquered by [[Francesco I Sforza|Francesco Sforza]], of the [[House of Sforza]], which made Milan one of the leading cities of the Italian [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lucas:268&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;InternationalStudent&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://internationalrelations.unicatt.it/it/international_student/the_history_of_milan |title=The History of Milan – Relazioni Internazionali – Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore |publisher=internationalrelations.unicatt.it |accessdate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern===
[[File:Braun Milano HAAB.jpg|thumb|right|The late 16th-century city encircled by the [[Walls of Milan#Spanish walls|Spanish walls]].]]

The French king [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]] first laid claim to the duchy in 1492. At that time, Milan was defended by [[Swiss mercenaries]]. After the victory of Louis's successor Francis I over the Swiss at the [[Battle of Marignano]], the duchy was promised to the French king [[Francis I of France|Francis I]]. When the Habsburg [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] defeated Francis I at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525, [[northern Italy]], including Milan, passed to the [[House of Habsburg]].&lt;ref&gt;John Lothrop Motley, ''The Rise of the Dutch Republic'' Vol. II (Harper Bros.: New York, 1855) p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1556, Charles V abdicated in favour of his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and his brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]]. Charles's Italian possessions, including Milan, passed to Philip II and the Spanish line of Habsburgs, while Ferdinand's Austrian line of Habsburgs ruled the Holy Roman Empire. The [[Italian plague of 1629–1631|Great Plague of Milan]] in 1629–31 killed an estimated 60,000 people out of a population of 130,000. This episode is considered one of the last outbreaks of the centuries-long [[pandemic]] of plague that began with the [[Black Death]].&lt;ref&gt;Cipolla, Carlo M. ''Fighting the Plague in Seventeenth Century Italy''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1700 the Spanish line of Habsburgs was extinguished with the death of [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]]. After his death, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began in 1701 with the occupation of all Spanish possessions by French troops backing the claim of the French [[Philip V of Spain|Philippe of Anjou]] to the Spanish throne. In 1706, the French were defeated in [[Battle of Ramillies|Ramillies]] and [[Battle of Turin|Turin]] and were forced to yield northern Italy to the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Habsburgs]]. In 1713, the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] formally confirmed Austrian sovereignty over most of Spain's Italian possessions including [[Lombardy]] and its capital, Milan.

[[Napoleon]] invaded Italy in 1796, and Milan was declared capital of the [[Cisalpine Republic]]. Later, he declared Milan capital of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] and was crowned in the Duomo. Once Napoleon's occupation ended, the [[Congress of Vienna]] returned Lombardy, and Milan, along with [[Veneto]], to Austrian control in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bloy|first= Marjie|title= The Congress of Vienna, 1 November 1814—8 June 1815|publisher= The Victorian Web|date= 30 April 2002|url= http://www.victorianweb.org/history/forpol/vienna.html|accessdate=9 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Milan became a centre of lyric opera. Here in the 1770s [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] had premiered three operas at the [[Teatro Regio Ducal]]. Later [[La Scala]] became the reference theatre in the world, with its premières of [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and Verdi. [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] himself is interred in the [[Casa di Riposo per Musicisti]], his present to Milan. In the 19th century other important theatres were ''La Cannobiana'' and the ''Teatro Carcano''.

On 18 March 1848, the Milanese rebelled against Austrian rule, during the so-called &quot;[[Five Days of Milan|Five Days]]&quot; ([[Italian language|Italian:]] ''Le Cinque Giornate''), and Field Marshal [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz|Radetzky]] was forced to withdraw from the city temporarily. However, after defeating Italian forces at [[Battle of Custoza (1848)|Custoza]] on 24 July, Radetzky was able to reassert Austrian control over Milan and northern Italy. However, Italian nationalists, championed by the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], called for the removal of Austria in the interest of [[Italian unification]]. Sardinia and France formed an alliance and defeated Austria at the [[Battle of Solferino]] in 1859.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solferino&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title= Solferino |author=Graham J. Morris|url= http://www.battlefieldanomalies.com/solferino/08_the_battle.htm |accessdate=9 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this battle, Milan and the rest of Lombardy were incorporated into the Kingdom of Sardinia, which soon gained control of most of Italy and in 1861 was rechristened as the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]]. The [[Italian unification|political unification of Italy]] cemented Milan's commercial dominance over northern Italy. It also led to a flurry of railway construction that had started under Austrian partronage (Venice-Milan; Milan-Monza) that made Milan the rail hub of northern Italy. Thereafter with the opening of the [[Gotthard Rail Tunnel|Gotthard]] (1881) and [[Simplon Pass|Simplon]] (1906) railway tunnels, Milan became the major South European rail focus for business and passenger movements e.g. the Simplon Orient Express. Rapid industrialization and market expansion put Milan at the centre of Italy's leading industrial region, though in the 1890s Milan was shaken by the [[Bava-Beccaris massacre]], a riot related to a high [[inflation rate]]. Meanwhile, as Milanese banks dominated Italy's financial sphere, the city became the country's leading [[financial centre]]. Milan's economic growth brought a rapid expansion in the city's area and population during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;World&quot;/&gt;

===Late modern and contemporary===

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-12689, Mailand, Signallampen im Straßenverkehr.jpg|thumb|right|View of [[Piazza del Duomo, Milan]] in the early 20th century.]]

In 1918, the [[Great War]] ended with Italy among the winning powers, but the heavy toll of the conflict manifested itself in terms of food shortage, high unemployment and hyperinflation that quickly led to social unrest. Exploiting these favorable circumstances, [[Benito Mussolini]] organized his [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] [[Blackshirts]], that rallied for the first time in Piazza San Sepolcro, a small square near Milan Cathedral. Subsequently, Mussolini led his [[March on Rome]] starting from Milan. During the [[Second World War]] Milan suffered severe damage from British and American bombings. When [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|Italy quit the war]] in 1943, German forces occupied most of Northern Italy until 1945. As a result, antifascist resistance groups formed and started guerilla operations against Nazi and [[Italian Social Republic]]'s troops. As the war came to an end, the American [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] advanced on Milan as part of the [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy|Po Valley Campaign]]. But before they arrived, members of the [[Italian resistance movement]] took control of the city and executed Mussolini along with several members of his collaborationist government. On 29 April 1945, the corpses of Mussolini, his mistress [[Clara Petacci]] and other Fascist hierarcs were infamously hanged in [[Piazzale Loreto]], where a year before fifteen antifascists had been executed. [[File:Pirelli T1.png|thumb|left|150px|The [[Pirelli Tower]] under construction, symbol of the post-war [[Italian economic miracle]].]]

After the war, the city was the [[Milan (camp)|site of a refugee camp]] for Jews fleeing from [[Austria]]. During the [[Italian economic miracle|economic miracle]] of the 1950s and 1960s, a large wave of internal migration, especially peasants from rural areas of [[Southern Italy]], moved to the city. During this period, Milan saw a quick reconstruction of most of its destroyed houses and factories, with the building of several innovative and modernist skyscrapers, such as the Torre Velasca and the Pirelli Tower. The economic boom was however overshadowed in the late 1960s and early 1970s during the so called [[Years of Lead]], when Milan witnessed an unprecedented wave of steet violence, labour strikes and political terrorism. The apex of this period of turmoil occurred on 12 December 1969, when a [[Piazza Fontana bombing|bomb]] exploded at the National Agrarian Bank in Piazza Fontana, killing seventeen people and injuring eighty-eight.

In the 1980s, as several fashion firms based in the city became internationally successful (such as Armani, Versace and Dolce &amp; Gabbana), Milan started to be recognized as one of the world's fashion capitals. The traditionally affordable and practical, yet stylish and chic attire produced by the city's stylists made it a serious global competitor, threatening Paris' century-long status as the world capital of ''[[haute couture]]''. The city saw also a rise in international tourism, notably from America and Japan. This period of prosperity and the new international image of the city led many journalists to call the metropolis ''&quot;Milano da bere&quot;'', literally &quot;Milan to drink&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/cultura/200804articoli/31497girata.asp |title=L'uomo che inventò la Milano da bere |publisher=Lastampa.It |date=4 January 2008 |accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1990s, Milan was badly affected by [[Tangentopoli]], a major political scandal centered on public works bribes, in which several local and national politicians and businessmen were tried for alleged corruption. The city was also affected by a severe financial crisis and a steady decline in textiles, automobile and steel production, that led to a deep reorganization of its economy.


In the early 21st century, Milan underwent a series of massive redevelopments, with the moving of its exhibition center to a much larger site in the satellite town of [[Rho (Italy)|Rho]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.storiadimilano.it/cron/dal1991al2000.htm |title=Storia di Milano ::: dal 1991 al 2000 |publisher=Storiadimilano.it |accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the construction of a new financial district in [[Porta Nuova]]. The 2008 announcement of the city hosting the [[Expo 2015]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.storiadimilano.it/cron/dal2001.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080118041353/http://www.storiadimilano.it/cron/dal2001.htm|archivedate=18 January 2008 |title=Storia di Milano ::: dal 2001 |publisher=Storiadimilano.it |accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; has brightened prospects for the city's future, with several new plans of regeneration and the planned construction of numerous avant-garde structures. Despite the decline in Milan's manufacturing production,&lt;ref name=&quot;auto_NvjyqU+TaXnePfXnMamasQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.arianuovainlombardia.it/ Eco-milanese.doc|title= La Locomotive if il fiatone|language=Italian |accessdate=7 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the city has found alternative and successful sources of revenue, including publishing, finance, banking, food processing, information technology, [[logistics]], transport and tourism.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto_NvjyqU+TaXnePfXnMamasQ&quot;/&gt; In addition, Milan's population seems to have stabilized in recent years, with signs of recovery as it grew by five percent since 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISTAT&quot;/&gt;

==Municipal administration==

===City government===

[[File:Milano pal Marino piazza Scala.jpg|thumb|left|[[Palazzo Marino]], Milan City Hall.]]
[[File:PisapiaPrimopiano.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Giuliano Pisapia]], mayor since 2011.]]
[[File:Quartieri.png|thumb|150px|The city's nine boroughs.]]

In its postwar political history, Milan has been governed for more than thirty years by a center-left coalition including the [[Italian Socialist Party]] and the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]], while in the 1980s the political balance shifted further left with coalitions between the Socialists, the [[Italian Communist Party|Communists]] and the newborn Greens. However, after a sensational uncovering of massive [[Tangentopoli|bribes scandals]] in the early 1990s, the city had become a stronghold of the conservative coalition led by Milanese media-magnate [[Silvio Berlusconi]] combined with the secessionist far-right movement [[Lega Nord|Northern League]], a trend that seems to have been reversed only by the 2011 municipal elections, in which a progressive candidate successfully contested the mayoral seat, thus ending almost 20 years of conservative administrations.

The legislative body of the municipality (''[[Italian commune|commune]]'') is the City Council (''Consiglio Comunale''), which is composed by 48 members elected every five years. Milan's executive body is the City Committee (''Giunta Comunale''), composed by 16 [[Assessor (Italy)|assessors]] and presieded over by the mayor. The current mayor of Milan is [[Giuliano Pisapia]], expression of a progressive alliance composed by the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party of Italy]], [[Left Ecology Freedom]], the [[Federation of the Greens|Greens]] and the [[Communist Refoundation Party]].

===Boroughs===
{{Main|Boroughs of Milan}}

The municipality of Milan is further subdivided into nine devolution boroughs (''zone''), down from the former twenty boroughs before the 1999 administrative reform. The boroughs are governed by a president and a borough council, elected contextually to the city mayor. Since the 2011 mayoral elections, all the administrative boroughs are governed by center-left representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I consigli di zona|url=http://www.comune.milano.it/portale/wps/portal/CDM?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/contentlibrary/In+Comune/In+Comune/I+Consigli+di+Zona/|publisher=Comune di Milano|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boroughs have the power to advise the mayor with nonbinding opinions on a large spectrum of topics (environment, construction, public health, local markets); in addition they are supplied with an autonomous founding in order to finance local activities.

==Geography==
[[File:Milan at Night.JPG|thumb|Night satellite picture of Milan.]]

===Topography===
Milan is located in the north-western section of the great [[Po Valley]], between the rivers [[Ticino]] and [[Adda (river)|Adda]], among the river [[Po (river)|Po]] and the first reliefs of the [[Alps]]. The municipal territory is entirely flat, the highest point being at {{convert|122|m|2|abbr=on}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The administrative ''commune'' covers, behind its borders, a total surface area of about {{convert|181|km²|0|abbr=on}}. However, the continuously built-up area trespass by far the city limits and forms a vast [[urban agglomeration]] with the large residential suburs of [[Assago]], [[Opera, Lombardy|Opera]], [[San Donato Milanese]], [[San Giuliano Milanese]], [[Cologno Monzese]] and [[Segrate]] to the south and east, the industrial towns of [[Sesto San Giovanni]], [[Cinisello Balsamo]], [[Paderno Dugnano]], [[Rho]], [[Legnano]] and [[Busto Arsizio]] to the north and west, up to including [[Monza]] and many other lesser settlements.

===Climate===
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
Milan has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa'') without any influence from the seaside. The Climatic Classification is &quot;zone E, 2259 GR/G&quot;– similar to much of Northern Italy's inland plains, where sultry summers and very cold, wet winters prevail.&lt;ref name=&quot;NatGeo&quot;/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2011}}
The minimum temperature record is -17.6 and the highest is 39.

Average temperatures in city center are {{convert|3|°C|°F|0}} in January with {{convert|-2|°C|°F|0}} for the minimum and {{convert|25|°C|°F|0}} in July with average maximum of {{convert|30|°C|°F|0}}. During winter, accumulating snowfall can occur and is not as rare as in central and southern parts of Italy. The historic average of Milan's area is of {{convert|21|cm|in|0}} during the period between 1950 and 2007, with a record of {{convert|70|cm|in|0}} during the snowfall of January 1985.

In the stereotypical image, the city is often shrouded in the heavy fog characteristic of cold seasons in the [[Po Valley|Po Basin]], although the removal of rice paddies from the southern neighborhoods, the [[urban heat island]] effect and the reduction of pollution from factories have reduced this phenomenon in recent years, at least in the city centre, although pollution is still very high. Wind is generally absent. In spring, though, gale-force windstorms can happen, generated either by [[Tramontane|Tramontana]] blowing from the Alps or by [[Bora (wind)|Bora]]-like winds from northeast.

[[File:DuomoDiMilano.jpg|thumb|left|The Gothic façade of the Milan Cathedral.]]

There are few remains of the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] colony that later became a capital of the Western Roman Empire. During the second half of the 4th century, [[Ambrose|Saint Ambrose]], as bishop of Milan, had a strong influence on the layout of the city, redesigning the centre (although the cathedral and baptistery built at this time are now lost) and building the great basilicas at the city gates: [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio|Sant'Ambrogio]], [[San Nazaro in Brolo]], [[Basilica of San Simpliciano|San Simpliciano]] and [[Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio|Sant'Eustorgio]], which still stand, refurbished over the centuries, as some of the finest and most important churches in Milan. The largest and most important example of [[Gothic architecture]] in Italy, the [[Milan Cathedral]], is the fourth largest cathedral in the world&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes frommer's&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Duomo |work= Frommer's |url= http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/europe/italy/milan/25103/duomo/attraction-detail.html |accessdate=1 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; after [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome, the [[Seville Cathedral|Cathedral of Seville]] and a new cathedral in the [[Côte d'Ivoire|Ivory Coast]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes frommer's&quot;/&gt; Built between 1386 and 1577, it hosts the world's largest collection of marble statues with the widely visible golden Madonna statue on top of the spire, nicknamed by the people of Milan as ''Madunina'' (the little Madonna), that became one of the symbols of the city.

[[File:Castello Sforzesco (Milan) - Courtyard 00.JPG|thumb|The [[Castello Sforzesco]], ancient residence of the [[House of Sforza]].]]

In the second half of the fifteenth century, when the [[House of Sforza|Sforza]] ruled the city, the old Visconti fortress was enlarged and embellished to became the [[Castello Sforzesco]]: the seat of an elegant Renaissance court surrounded by a walled hunting park stocked with game captured around the [[Seprio]] and [[Lake Como]]. Notable architects involved in the project included the [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Filarete]], who was commissioned to build the high central entrance tower, and the military specialist Bartolomeo Gadio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.milanocastello.it/ing/lungaRicostruito.html 'The Castle Reconstructed by the Sforza'], Castello Sforzesco website.&lt;/ref&gt; The political alliance between Francesco Sforza and the Florence of [[Cosimo de' Medici]] bore architectural fruit, as Milanese building came under the influence of [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]an models of Renaissance architecture. The first notable buildings to show this Tuscan influence were a palazzo built to house the [[Medici Bank]] (of which only the main entrance survives) and the centrally planned [[Portinari Chapel]], attached to Sant’Eustorgio and built for the first manager of the bank's Milan branch. Filarete, while in Milan, was responsible for the great public hospital known as the [[Ospedale Maggiore]], and also for an influential ''Treatise on Architecture'', which included a plan for a star-shaped [[ideal city]] called Sforzinda in honour of [[Francesco I Sforza|Francesco Sforza]] and passionately argued for the centrally planned form. [[File:Santa Maria delle Grazie Milano 07-08-2007.JPG|thumb|left|Church of [[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)|Santa Maria delle Grazie]].]][[Leonardo da Vinci]], who was in Milan from around 1482 until the fall of the city to the French in 1499, was commissioned in 1487 to design a ''tiburio'', or [[crossing (architecture)|crossing tower]] for the cathedral, although he was not chosen to build it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universalleonardo.org/lifeevent.php?event=275 &quot;First Milanese period 1481/2 – 1499 (1487)&quot;], Universal Leonardo.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universalleonardo.org/lifeevent.php?event=276 &quot;First Milanese period 1481/2 – 1499 (1488)&quot;], Universal Leonardo.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the enthusiasm he shared with Filarete for the centrally-planned building gave rise in this period to numerous architectural drawings [pictured], which were influential in the work of [[Donato Bramante]] and others. Bramante's work in the city, which included [[Santa Maria presso San Satiro]] (a reconstruction of a small 9th-century church), the beautiful luminous tribune of [[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)|Santa Maria delle Grazie]] and three cloisters for Sant'Ambrogio, drew also on his studies of the Early Christian architecture of Milan such as the Basilica of San Lorenzo.&lt;ref name=&quot;murray&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Murray|year=1986|title=The Architecture of the Italian Renaissance|chapter=Milan: Filarete, Leonardo Bramante|pages=105–120|publisher=Thames and Hudson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Counter-Reformation]] was also the period of [[Spanish Empire|Spanish domination]] and was marked by two powerful figures: [[Charles Borromeo|Saint Charles Borromeo]] and his cousin, [[Federico Borromeo|Cardinal Federico Borromeo]]. Not only did they impose themselves as moral guides to the people of Milan, but they also gave a great impulse to culture, with the creation of the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]], in a building designed by [[Francesco Maria Richini|Francesco Maria Ricchino]], and the nearby [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]]. Many notable churches and Baroque mansions were built in the city during this period by the architects, [[Pellegrino Tibaldi]], [[Galeazzo Alessi]] and Ricchino himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittkower&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Rudolf|last=Wittkower|year=1993|title=Pelican History of Art|chapter=Art and Architecture Italy, 1600–1750|others=1980|publisher=Penguin Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AbbaziaChiaravalle.jpg|thumb|The [[Chiaravalle Abbey]], founded in 1135.]]

Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] was responsible for the significant renovations carried out in Milan during the 18th century. She instigated profound social and civil reforms, as well as the construction of many of the buildings that still today constitute the pride of the city, like the [[La Scala|Teatro alla Scala]], inaugurated on 3 August 1778 and today one of the world's most famous [[opera house]]s. The annexed [[Museo Teatrale alla Scala]] contains a collection of paintings, drafts, statues, costumes, and other documents regarding opera and La Scala's history. La Scala also hosts the [[La Scala Theatre Ballet School|Ballet School of the Teatro alla Scala]]. The Austrian sovereign also promoted culture in Milan through projects such as converting the ancient [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] College, in the district of Brera, into a scientific and cultural centre with a Library, an astronomic observatory and the [[botanical garden]]s, in which the [[Pinacoteca di Brera|Art Gallery]] and the [[Brera Academy|Academy of Fine Arts]] are today placed side by side. Milan was also widely affected by the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] movement in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, transforming its architectural style.

[[File:Arco della pace 2011.jpg |thumb|left|The Arch of Peace, erected in 1807 by [[Napoleon]] in Neoclassical style.]]

[[First French Empire|French Imperial]] rule of the city in the early 19th century produced several fine Neoclassical structures and mansions, Many of these are located in the Corso Venezia district,&lt;ref name=&quot;storiadimilano.it&quot;&gt;http://www.storiadimilano.it/Arte/neoclassicismo.htm&lt;/ref&gt; including Villa Reale or Villa del Belgiojoso, built by Leopoldo Pollak in 1790.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutmilan.com/monuments-in-Milan.html |title=Monuments in Milan |publisher=Aboutmilan.com |accessdate=14 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It housed the Bonaparte family, mainly [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Josephine Bonaparte]], but also several others key political figures of 1800, such as Count [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz]] and [[Eugène de Beauharnais]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; It is often regarded as one of the best types of [[Neoclassical architecture]] in Milan and Lombardy, surrounded by an [[English garden|English landscape garden]]. Today, it hosts a Gallery Contemporary Art in a fine context of classical columns, vast halls, marble statues and crystal chandeliers.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; [[File:Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II Milan May 2009.jpg|thumb|right|[[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]]: interior view.]] Addictional, major examples of Neoclassical architecture in the city includes Palazzo Belgiojoso, former grand Napoleonic residence, and Palazzo Tarsis, built by Luigi Clerichetti for Count Paolo Tarsis in 1834, famous for its ornate façade.&lt;ref name=&quot;storiadimilano.it&quot;/&gt; The massive [[Arch of Peace]],&lt;ref name=&quot;storiadimilano.it&quot;/&gt; also known as ''Porta Sempione'' (Sempione Gate), is situated in Piazza Sempione right at the end of the omonimous park. It is often compared to a miniature version of the [[Arc de Triomphe]] in [[Paris]]. The works began in 1806 by order of Napoleone Bonaparte, under superivison of architect [[Luigi Cagnola]]. Just like with the Arc de Triomphe, Napoleon's 1815 defeat at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], halted the construction of the monumental arch, but [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Josef I of Austria]] ordered it to be completed as a celebration of the [[Congress of Vienna|Vienna Congress]] and the peace treaties of 1815. It was completed by Francesco Peverelli on 10 September 1838.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Another noted Neoclassical building in the city is the Palazzo del Governo, constructed in 1817 by Piero Gilardoni.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Cimitero monumentale (famedio).JPG|thumb|left|The gates of [[Cimitero Monumentale]].]]

In the second half of the 19th century, Milan quicklt became the main industrial center in [[Italian Peninsula|Italy]], drewing inspiration from the great European capitals that were hubs of the technological innovations of the [[Second Industrial Revolution|second industrial revolution]] and, consequently, of the deep [[social change]] that had been put in motion. The great [[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]], a covered passage that connects [[Piazza del Duomo, Milan]] to the square opposite of [[La Scala]] opera house, was built by architect [[Giuseppe Mengoni]] between 1865 and 1877 to celebrate [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Vittorio Emanuele II]], first king of reunited Italy. The galleria is covered by an arching glass and cast iron roof, a popular design for 19th-century arcades, such as the [[Burlington Arcade]] in London, which was the prototype for larger glazed shopping arcades, beginning with the [[Royal Galleries of Saint-Hubert|Saint-Hubert Gallery]] in Brussels and the [[The Passage|Passazh]] in [[Saint Petersburg|St Petersburg]]. Another late 19th century eclectic monument in the city is [[Cimitero Monumentale]], built in a [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Neo-Romanesque]] style by several architects between 1863 and 1866.

[[File:Milano Guastalla Velasca.jpg|thumb|left|The iconic [[Torre Velasca|Velasca Tower]], built in 1958.]]

The tumultuous period of early 20th century brought several, radical innovations in  Milanese architecture. [[Art Nouveau]], also known as ''[[Liberty style|Liberty]]'' in Italy, started to develop in the city during the years before the Great War;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;http://www.storiadimilano.it/citta/Porta_Orientale/palazzi_liberty.htm&lt;/ref&gt; alongside other major Italian cities, most notably Palermo and Turin, this partcoular style became highly popular, producing several notable buildings in the city,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; developing its own, individual style known as &quot;''Liberty Milanese''&quot; (Milanese Art Nouveau), which, in many aspects, shares many traits with [[Vienna Secession]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.culturaitalia.it/pico/modules/percorso/it/percorso264/capitolo_0002.html?regione=lombardia&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly one of the most notable Art Nouveau edfices in Milan is [[Palazzo Castiglioni (Milan)|Palazzo Castiglioni]] in Corso Venezia, built by architect [[Giuseppe Sommaruga]] between 1901 and 1904.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; Other remarkable examples include Hotel Corso&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; and Berri-Meregalli house, the latter built in a traditional Milanese Art Nouveau style combined with elements of neo-Romanesque and Gothic revial architecture, regarded as one of the last such types of architecture in the city.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.100milano.com/liberty/191.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, with the [[Milan International (1906)|Universal Exposition]], the city was able to exhibit its Art Nouveau works, that was thus considered the official style of the exposition.&lt;ref name=&quot;culturaitalia.it&quot;&gt;http://www.culturaitalia.it/pico/modules/percorso/it/percorso264/capitolo_0006.html?regione=lombardia&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, as the century progressed, other styles started to be explored, including neo-Romanesque, eclectic and Gothic revival architecture, so Art Nouveau started falling out of fashion by c. 1913, when the official season was closed by Sommaruga.&lt;ref name=&quot;culturaitalia.it&quot;/&gt; A new, more eclectic form of architecture can be seen in buildings such as Castello Cova, built the 1910s in a distinctly neo-medieval style, evoking the architectural trends of the past.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.info2015expo.it/index.php?/archives/826-Castello-Cova.html&lt;/ref&gt; A late Example of Art Deco, which blended such styles with [[Fascist architecture]], is the massive [[Milano Centrale]] railway station by [[Ulisse Stacchini]], inaugurated in 1931. 

The post–World War II period saw rapid reconstruction and fast economic growth, accompanied by a nearly twofold increase in population. A strong demand for new residential and commercial areas drove to extreme urban expansion and architectural renewal, that has produced some of the major milestones in the city's architectural history, including [[Giò Ponti|Gio Ponti]]'s [[Pirelli Tower]] (1956–60), [[Torre Velasca|Velasca Tower]] (1956–58), and the creation of brand new residential satellite towns, as well as huge amounts of low quality public housings. In recent years, deindustrialization, urban decay and gentrification led to a massive urban renewal of former industrial areas, that have been transformed into modern residential and financial districts, notably [[Porta Nuova]] and [[FieraMilano]] in the suburb of [[Rho (Italy)|Rho]].

===Parks and gardens===

Despite the fact that Milan has a very small amount of green space in comparison to other cities of the same size,&lt;ref name=&quot;slideshare1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/mtmexperience/tourist-characteristics-and-the-perceived-image-of-milan |title=Tourist Characteristics and the Perceived Image of Milan |publisher=Slideshare.net |accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the city does boast a wide variety of parks and gardens. The first public parks were established 1857 and 1862, and were designed by Giuseppe Balzaretto. They were situated in a &quot;green park district&quot;, found in the areas of Piazzale Oberdan (Porta Venezia), [[Corso Venezia]], Via Palestro and Via Manin.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutmilan1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutmilan.com/gardens-and-parks-in-milan.html |title=Gardens and Parks in Milan |publisher=Aboutmilan.com |accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them were landscaped in a Neoclassical style and represented traditional [[English garden]]s, often full of botanic richness.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutmilan1&quot;/&gt; Since 1990 Milan is surrounded by the regional [[Parco Agricolo Sud Milano]] that wraps the southern half of the city, connecting Ticino Park in the west and Adda Park in the east. The Park was instituted in order to safeguard and enhance the old agricultural landscape and activities, woodlands and natural reserves, with an overall size of 47,000 hectares.

[[File:Parco delle Basiliche San Lorenzo.jpg|thumb|The Parco delle Basiliche, near the [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Milan|Basilica of San Lorenzo]]. Opened in 1934, it is one of the city's major parks, and it has an area of 40,700 square metres.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comune.milano.it/portale/wps/portal/CDM?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/contentlibrary/Ho%20bisogno%20di/Ho%20bisogno%20di/AreeVerdi_ParchieGiardini_Parco%20Papa%20Giovanni%20Paolo%20II&amp;categId=com.ibm.workplace.wcm.api.WCM_Category/IT_CAT_Bisogni_01_01/d2aaad80446e0187b8f1bbd36d110d8a/PUBLISHED&amp;categ=IT_CAT_Bisogni_01_01&amp;type=content&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The most important parks in Milan are the set of adjacent parks in the western area of the city forming Parco Agricolo Sud Milano (Parco delle Cave, 131 hectares; Boscoincittà, 110 hectares; and [[Trenno]] Park, 59 hectares, whose total area amounts to about 300 hectares), Sempione Park, Parco Forlanini, Giardini Pubblici, Giardino della Villa Comunale, Giardini della Guastalla and [[Lambro]] Park. Sempione Park is a large public park, situated between the [[Castello Sforzesco]] and the Peace Arch, near Piazza Sempione. It was built by Emilio Alemagna, and contains a Napoleonic Arena, the Milan City Aquarium, a tower, an art exhibition centre, some ponds and a library.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutmilan1&quot;/&gt; Then there is Parco Forlani, which, with a size of 235 hectares is the largest park in Milan,&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutmilan1&quot;/&gt; and contains a hill and a pond. Giardini Pubblici is among Milan's oldest remaining public parks, founded on 29 November 1783, and completed around 1790.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.storiadimilano.it/citta/Porta_Orientale/giardini.htm |title=Storia di Milano ::: Giardini pubblici |publisher=Storiadimilano.it |accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is landscaped in English style, containing a pond, a [[Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano|Natural History Museum of Milan]] and the Neoclassical Villa Reale. Giardini della Guastalla is also one of the oldest gardens in Milan, and consists mainly of a decorated fish pond.

Milan also hosts three important [[botanical garden]]s: the [[Orto Botanico Didattico Sperimentale dell'Università di Milano|Milan University Experimental Botanical Garden]] (a small botanical garden operated by the Istituto di Scienze Botaniche), the [[Orto Botanico di Brera|Brera Botanical Garden]] (another botanical garden, founded in 1774 by Fulgenzio Witman, an abbot under the orders of [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Empress Maria Theresa of Austria]], and restored in 1998 after several years of abandonment) and the [[Orto Botanico di Cascina Rosa|Cascina Rosa Botanical Garden]]. On 23 January 2003, a [[Righteous among the Nations|Garden of the Righteous]] was established in Monte Stella to commemorate those who opposed genocides and crimes against humankind. It hosts trees dedicated to [[Moshe Bejski]], [[Andrei Sakharov]], the founders of the Gardens of the Righteous in [[Yerevan]] and [[Pietro Kuciukian]], and others. The decision to commemorate a &quot;Righteous&quot; person in this Garden is made every year by a commission of high-profile characters.

The city proper has a population of 1,324,110 inhabitants as of December 2010. The population of Milan peaked at 1.7 million in 1973. Thereafter, during the following 30 years, almost one third of the population moved to the outer belt of new suburbs and satellite settlements that grew around the city proper.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISTAT&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://demo.istat.it/unitav/index.html?lingua=eng |title=Italian Population Life Tables by province and region of residence |publisher=demo.istat.it |accessdate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the city attracted increasing flows of foreign immigrants. The population of Milan, like many western cities, is characterized by low fertility rates, low crude birth rates and rapid [[ageing]]: in 2009, only 12.6% of the resident population was under 14, while 30.1% was over 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.milano.it/portale/wps/portal/searchresultdetail?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/ContentLibrary/ho+bisogno+di/ho+bisogno+di/banche+dati+e+statistiche_dati+statistici+relativi+alla+popolazione |title=COMUNE DI MILANO – Popolazione: dati statistici |publisher=Comune.milano.it |date=|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Second World War, Milan experienced two main waves of mass immigration: the first, dating from the 1950s to the 1970s, was formed by immigrantion from poorer and rural areas of Italy; the second, starting from the 1980s and ongoing, is mainly composed of foreign immigrants, especially from Eastern Europe, North Africa, Latin America and the Far East.

The first migration wave coincided with the so called [[Italian economic miracle]] of the 1950s and 1960s, a period of extraordinary growth based on rapid industrial expansion and massive public works, that brought to the city an immense flow of over 400,000 people, mainly from rural and overpopulated [[Southern Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

At the beginning of the 1990s, Milan already hosted a population of foreign-born immigrants of 58,000 (or 4% of the then population), that eventually rose to over 117,000 by the end of the decade (about 9% of the hen population).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

As of 2011, the Italian national institute of statistics [[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]] estimated that about 236,000 foreign-born immigrants lived in Milan, representing almost 20% of the total resident population, a rapid increase from recent years levels.&lt;ref name=istat2011demo&gt;{{cite news|title=Aumentano i residenti, crollano le nascite|url=http://milano.corriere.it/milano/notizie/cronaca/11_dicembre_29/rapporto-popolazione-stranieri-diciottenni-nascite-matrimoni-1902687364202.shtml|accessdate=29 December 2011|newspaper=Corriere della Sera Milano|date=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demo.istat.it/strasa2010/index_e.html |title=Statistiche demografiche ISTAT |publisher=Demo.istat.it |date=|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The top ten countries of origin of the foreign born residents were the Philippines, Egypt, China, Peru, Ecuador, Sri Lanka, Romania, Morocco, Ukraine and Albania.&lt;ref name=Estimates&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.comuni-italiani.it/015/146/statistiche/stranieri.html |title= Foreign born residents in Milan |publisher= ISTAT |accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Decades of mass immigration have made the city one of the most cosmopolitan and multi-cultural in Italy. Milan notably hosts the oldest and largest [[Milan Chinatown|Chinese community]] in Italy, with almost 19,000 people in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.milano.it/portale/wps/portal/searchresultdetail?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/ContentLibrary/ho+bisogno+di/ho+bisogno+di/banche+dati+e+statistiche_dati+statistici+relativi+agli+stranieri |title=COMUNE DI MILANO – Stranieri: dati statistici |publisher=Comune.milano.it |date=|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Situated in the [[Administrative divisions of Milan|9th district]], and centered on Via Paolo Sarpi, an important commercial avenue, the Milanese Chinatown was originally established in the 1920s by immigrants from [[Wencheng County]], in the [[Zhejiang]] province, and used to operate small textile and leather workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Its multi-ethnical heritage makes the street one of Milan's most cosmopolitan and colourful, notably during the celebrations of [[Chinese New Year]]. There is also a substantial anglophone community living in Milan, and several English language publications to cater for them, such as Hello Milano, Where Milano and [[Easy Milano]].

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Milan}}

[[File:Porta Nuova Skyline.jpg|thumb|left|The new Porta Nuova business district.]]

While Rome is Italy's political capital, Milan is the country's economic and financial heart. With a 2008 GDP estimated at €136 billion,&lt;ref name=&quot;Milan Chamber of Commerce&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mi.camcom.it/show.jsp?page=621540#interscambio|title=Milan in figures|publisher=Milan Chamber of Commerce |date=31 November 2009 |accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the urban region of Milan contributes almost 9 percent of the national GDP and is home to over 45 percent of businesses in the Lombard region and more than 8 percent of all businesses in Italy. Milan is home to most international banks and the country's principal stock exchange. It has also seen a rapid increase in internet companies with both domestic and international companies such as [[Altavista]], [[Google]], [[Lycos]], [[Virgilio.it|Virgilio]] and [[Yahoo!]] establishing their Italian operations in Milan. The city is, of course, famous for its fashion houses, with names such as [[Armani]], [[Versace]] and [[Valentino Garavani|Valentino]], and these have attracted numerous media and advertising agencies. Milan is also home a large number of telecommunication companies including both the state owned television companies and private media companies like [[Mediaset]] and [[Sky Italia]]. Milan also an important manufacturing center, especially for the automotive industry, with companies such as [[Alfa Romeo]] and [[Pirelli]] having a significant presence in the city. Other important products made in Milan include chemicals, machinery, pharmaceuticals and plastics. The city was included in a list of ten &quot;[[global city|Alpha world cities]]&quot; by Peter J. Taylor and Robert E. Lang of the [[Brookings Institution]]. 

As early as the late 12th century, the arts flourished and the making of [[armour]]s was the most important industry in Milan. This period saw the beginning of those irrigation works that still render the Lombard plain a fertile garden. The development of the [[wool|wool trade]] in 13th–14th century, subsequently gave the first impetus to the production of silk starting in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

As in Venice and Florence, the making of [[luxury good]]s was an industry of such importance that in the 16th century the city gave its name to the English word “''milaner''” or “''millaner''”, meaning fine wares like jewellery, cloth, hats and luxury apparel. By the 19th century, a later variant, “[[Hatmaking|millinery]]”, had come to mean one who made or sold hats. The [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]] in Northern Europe gave a new prominence to the north area of Milan. It sat on the [[trade route]] for goods coming over the Alps, and built mills powered by water from the many rivers and streams. In the mid-19th century cheaper silk began to be imported from Asia and the pest phylloxera damaged silk and wine production. More land was subsequently given over to industrialisation. Textile production was followed by metal and mechanical and furniture manufacture.

Today Milan is a European and world fashion centre, where the sector can count on 12,000 companies, 800 show rooms, and 6,000 sales outlets, while four weeks are dedicated to top shows and other events.&lt;ref name=&quot;SDA Bocconi School of Management&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdabocconi.it/en/about_sda_bocconi/living_in_milan/milan_italys_economic_driver/|title=Milan Italy's economic driver|publisher=SDA Bocconi School of Management|date=31 November 2009 |accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publishing and media are represented by 700 book publishers, national newspapers and magazines and the recording studios of the national broadcaster RAI and the largest private TV company Mediaset.

[[File:Expo 2015 logo.png|thumb|right|[[Expo 2015]] logo.]]

Other key sectors in the city's economy are advanced research in health and biotechnologies, chemicals and engineering, banking and finance.&lt;ref name=&quot;SDA Bocconi School of Management&quot;/&gt; Milan is the home to Italy's main banking groups (198 companies) and over forty foreign banks. The Associazione Bancaria Italiana representing the Italian banking system and [[Borsa Italiana|Milan Stock Exchange]] (225 companies listed on the stock exchange) are both located in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;SDA Bocconi School of Management&quot;/&gt; The city can boast one of Europe's largest trade fair systems of over 1,600,000 sq.m. About 4.5 million visitors flock to the around 75 major events every year from all over the world as well as to the high-tech conference centres.&lt;ref name=&quot;SDA Bocconi School of Management&quot;/&gt; It is also a leader in the third sector of non-profit organisations with 6,000 bodies in the greater Milan area.&lt;ref name=&quot;SDA Bocconi School of Management&quot;/&gt;

Tourism is also an important part of the city's industry. While [[Euromonitor International]] have estimated that there were 1.894 million international arrivals in 2009, the Milan Chamber of Commerce estimates that there were over 5.5 million tourist arrivals in the same year, of which over 2.9 million were Italian, otherwise national, arrivals while over 2.6 million were international.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milan Chamber of Commerce&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mi.camcom.it/show.jsp?page=621540#turismo|title=Milan in figures|publisher=Milan Chamber of Commerce |date=31 November 2009 |accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milan is presently undergoing a massive urban renewal. [[FieraMilano]], the historical city trade fair operator, owned a [[Fair Ground|fair ground]] known as &quot;''FieraMilanoCity''&quot;, which was dismantled to be house for a major [[urban planning|urban development]], [[CityLife (Milan)|CityLife]] district. The new trade exhibition center, built in the north-western suburb of [[Rho (Italy)|Rho]] and inaugurated in April 2005, makes FieraMilano one of the largest expo areas in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.fieramilano.it/portal/page?_pageid=36,39304&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|publisher=FieraMilano|accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with CityLife, many other construction projects are under way to rehabilitate disused industrial areas. Several famous architects take part in the projects, such as [[Renzo Piano]], [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]], [[Zaha Hadid]],&lt;ref name=citylife&gt;{{cite web|title=official website|url=http://www.city-life.it/en/hi-res/|publisher=CityLife|accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Massimiliano Fuksas]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fuksas.it/#/progetti/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Daniel Libeskind]].&lt;ref name=citylife/&gt; Many of these projects are in preparation contextually to the [[Expo 2015|Milan 2015 Expo]].

Most tourists visit sights such as [[Milan Cathedral]], the [[Castello Sforzesco]] and the [[La Scala|Teatro alla Scala]], however, other main sights such as the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]], the [[Navigli]] and the [[Brera Academy|Brera Academy and district]] are less visited and prove to be less popular.&lt;ref name=&quot;slideshare1&quot;/&gt;

The [[Pinacoteca di Brera]] is one of Milan's most important art galleries.

Milan's figurative art flourished in the [[Middle Ages|Middle-Ages]], and with the [[Visconti]] family being major patrons of the arts, the city became an important centre of [[Gothic art]] and architecture ([[Milan Cathedral]] being the city's most formidable work of Gothic architecture).&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutmilan.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutmilan.com/art-and-culture-of-milan.html |title=Art and Culture of Milan: from the past to the contemporary |publisher=Aboutmilan.com |accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, rule of the [[House of Sforza|Sforza family]], between the 14th and 15th century, was another period in which art and architecture flourished. Milan became the seat of an elegant Renaissance court,&lt;ref name=&quot;Castello Sforzesco&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milanocastello.it/intro.html |title=Castello Sforzesco |publisher=Milanocastello.it |accessdate=19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while great works, such as the [[Ospedale Maggiore]], the public hospital designed by [[Filarete]] were built, and artists of the calibre of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] came to work in Milan, leaving works of inestimable value, such as the fresco of the [[Last Supper]] and the [[Codex Atlanticus]]. [[File:Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) - The Last Supper (1495-1498).jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo's]] [[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|'' The Last Supper'']].]] [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]] also came to Milan to work on the construction of some of the most beautiful churches in the city; in [[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)|Santa Maria delle Grazie]] the beautiful luminous tribune is by Bramante, as is the church of [[Santa Maria presso San Satiro]].

The city was affected by the [[Baroque]] in the 17th and 18th centuries, and hosted numerous formidable artists, architects and painters of that period, such as [[Caravaggio]] and [[Francesco Hayez]], which several important works are hosted in [[Brera Academy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutmilan.com&quot;/&gt;

Milan in the 20th century was the epicenter of the [[Futurism|Futurist]] artistic movement. [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|Filippo Marinetti]], the founder of Italian Futurism wrote in his 1909 &quot;''[[Futurist Manifesto]]''&quot; (in Italian, ''Manifesto Futuristico''), that Milan was &quot;''grande...tradizionale e futurista''&quot; (&quot;''grand...traditional and futuristic''&quot;, in English). [[Umberto Boccioni]] was also an important Futurism artist who worked in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutmilan.com&quot;/&gt; Today, Milan remains a major international hub of modern and contemporary art, with numerous modern exhibitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutmilan.com&quot;/&gt;

The [[Museo Poldi Pezzoli]] is another of the city's most important and prestigious museums. The museum was originated in the 19th century as the private collection of Gian Giacomo Poldi Pezzoli and his mother, Rosa Trivulzio, of the family of the condottiero [[Gian Giacomo Trivulzio]], and has a particularly broad collection of Northern Italian and (for Italy) Netherlandish/Flemish artists.
The [[Museum of the Risorgimento (Milan)|Museum of the Risorgimento]] (''Museo del Risorgimento'') is a museum in Milan on the history of [[Italian unification]] from 1796 (Napoleon's first Italian campaign) and 1870 (Rome's annexation into the Kingdom of Italy) and on Milan's part in it (particularly the [[Five Days of Milan]]). It is housed in the 18th century Palazzo Moriggia. Its collections include [[Baldassare Verazzi]]'s ''Episode from the Five Days'' and [[Francesco Hayez]]'s 1840 ''[[:File:Francesco Hayez 047.jpg|Portrait]] of Emperor [[Ferdinand I of Austria]]''. La [[Triennale]] di Milano is a design museum and events venue located inside the Palace of Art building, part of Parco Sempione, the park grounds adjacent to [[Castello Sforzesco]]. It hosts exhibitions and events highlighting contemporary Italian design, urban planning, architecture, music, and media arts, emphasizing the relationship between art and industry.

===Fashion and design===

[[File:Milan Fashion Week 1.jpg|thumb|right|2010 [[Milan Fashion Week]] event.]]

Milan is regarded as one of the international capitals of industrial and modern design, and one of the world's most influential cities in such fields.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiley.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470026839.html |title=Design City Milan |publisher=Wiley |accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is particularly well known for its high-quality ancient and modern furniture and industrial goods. Milan hosts the [[FieraMilano]], Europe's biggest, and one of the world's most prestigious furniture and design fairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiley.com&quot;/&gt; Milan also hosts major design and architecture-related events and venues, such as the &quot;''Fuori Salone''&quot; and the [[Salone del Mobile]]. In the 1950s and 60s as well as early 70's, being the main industrial centre of [[Italy]] and one of mainland Europe's most progressive and dynamic cities, Milan became, along with [[Turin]], Italy's capital of post-war design and architecture. Skyscrapers, such as the [[Pirelli Tower]] and the [[Torre Velasca]] were constructed, and artists such as [[Bruno Munari]], [[Lucio Fontana]], [[Enrico Castellani]] and [[Piero Manzoni]], to name a few, either lived or worked in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/milan_turin |title=Frieze Magazine &amp;#124; Archive &amp;#124; Milan and Turin |publisher=Frieze.com |accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milan is also regarded as one of the [[fashion capital]]s of the world, along with [[New York Fashion Week|New York City]], [[Paris Fashion Week|Paris]], and [[London Fashion Week|London]]. The [[Global Language Monitor]] declared that in 2009 Milan was the top economic and media global capital of fashion,&lt;ref name=&quot;languagemonitor.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.languagemonitor.com/popular-culture/fashion |title=The Global Language Monitor &quot; Fashion |publisher=Languagemonitor.com |date=20 July 2009 |accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact it fell down to sixth place in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By: admin |url=http://www.languagemonitor.com/fashion-capitals/new-york-regains-fashion-capital-crown-from-milan/ |title=The Global Language Monitor » Blog Archive » New York Regains Fashion Capital Crown from Milan |publisher=Languagemonitor.com |date=|accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went up to fourth place in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.languagemonitor.com/?s=fashion+capital&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the major [[Italian fashion]] brands, such as [[Valentino SpA|Valentino]], [[Gucci]], [[Versace]], [[Prada]], [[Armani]] and [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]], are currently headquartered in the city. Numerous international fashion labels also operate shops in Milan, including an [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]] flagship store, which has become a main consumer attraction. Furthermore, the city hosts the [[Milan Fashion Week]] twice a year, just like other international centres such as Paris, London, Tokyo, and New York. Milan's main upscale fashion district is the ''[[quadrilatero della moda]]'' (literally, &quot;fashion quadrilateral&quot;), where the city's most prestigious shopping streets ([[Via Monte Napoleone]], [[Via della Spiga]], [[Via Sant'Andrea]], [[Via Manzoni]] and [[Corso Venezia]]) are held. The [[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]], the [[Piazza del Duomo, Milan|Piazza del Duomo]], [[Via Dante]] and [[Corso Buenos Aires]] are other important shopping streets and squares. [[Mario Prada]], founder of [[Prada]] was born here, helping to cultivate its position as a world fashion capital.

===Cuisine===
[[File:Panettone aufgeschnitten freigestellt.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Panettone]]'', traditional Christmas cake.]]

Like most cities in Italy, Milan and its surrounding area has its own regional cuisine, which, as it is typical for Lombard cuisines, uses more frequently rice than pasta, and features almost no tomato. Milanese cuisine includes &quot;[[cotoletta|cotoletta alla milanese]]&quot;, a breaded veal (pork and turkey can be used) cutlet pan-fried in butter (which some claim to be of Austrian origin, as it is similar to Viennese &quot;Wienerschnitzel&quot;, while others claim that the &quot;Wienerschnitzel&quot; derived from the &quot;cotoletta alla milanese&quot;). Other typical dishes are ''[[cassoeula]]'' (stewed pork rib chops and sausage with [[Cabbage|Savoy cabbage]]), [[ossobuco]] (stewed veal shank with a sauce called ''gremolata''), [[risotto|risotto alla milanese]] (with saffron and beef marrow), ''busecca'' (stewed tripe with beans), and ''brasato'' (stewed beef or pork with wine and potatoes). Season-related pastries include ''chiacchiere'' (flat fritters dusted with sugar) and ''tortelli'' (fried spherical cookies) for [[Carnival]], ''colomba'' (glazed cake shaped as a dove) for Easter, ''pane dei morti'' (&quot;Deads' Day bread&quot;, cookies aromatized with cinnamon) for [[All Souls' Day|All Soul's Day]] and [[panettone]] for Christmas. The ''salame milano'', a [[salami]] with a very fine grain, is widespread throughout Italy. The best known Milanese cheese is [[gorgonzola (cheese)|gorgonzola]] from the namesake town nearby, although today the major gorgonzola producers operate in Piedmont.

On addition to a unique cuisine, Milan has several world-renowned restaurants and cafés. Most of the more refined and upper-class restaurants are found in the historic centre, while the more traditional and popular ones are mainly located in the Brera and [[Navigli]] districts. Today, there is also a [[Nobu Matsuhisa|Nobu]] Japanese restaurant in Milan, which is located in Armani World in [[Via Manzoni]] and is regarded as being one of the trendiest restaurants in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtravelguide.net/city/82/restaurant/Europe/Milan.html |title=Milan Restaurants |publisher=Worldtravelguide.net |accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the city's chicest cafés or ''pasticcerie'' is the [[Caffè Cova]], an ancient Milanese coffeehouse founded in 1817 near the Teatro alla Scala, which has also opened franchises in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pasticceriacova.com/storia/history.html |title=Cova Pasticceria Confetteria – dal 1817 |publisher=Pasticceriacova.com |accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Biffi Caffè and the Zucca in Galleria are also famous and historical &quot;Caffès&quot; situated in Milan. Other restaurants in Milan include the Hotel Four Seasons restaurant, La Briciola, the Marino alla Scala and the Chandelier. Today, there is also a [[McDonald's]] [[fast food|fast-food]] restaurant in the [[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]], and some new boutique-cafés, such as the Just Cavalli Café, owned by the luxury fashion goods brand [[Roberto Cavalli]].

===Language and literature===
{{Main|Milanese literature}}

[[File:Alessandro Manzoni statue.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Monument to [[Alessandro Manzoni]] in Piazza San Fedele.]]

In the late 18th century, and throughout the 19th, Milan was an important centre for intellectual discussion and literary creativity. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] found here a fertile ground. [[Cesare Beccaria|Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria]], with his famous ''[[Dei delitti e delle pene]]'', and Count [[Pietro Verri]], with the periodical ''Il Caffè'' were able to exert a considerable influence over the new [[middle class|middle-class]] culture, thanks also to an open-minded Austrian administration. In the first years of the 19th century, the ideals of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] made their impact on the cultural life of the city and its major writers debated the primacy of Classical versus [[Romantic poetry]]. Here, too, [[Giuseppe Parini]], and [[Ugo Foscolo]] published their most important works, and were admired by younger poets as masters of ethics, as well as of literary craftsmanship. Foscolo's poem ''[[Dei sepolcri]]'' was inspired by a Napoleonic law that—against the will of many of its inhabitants—was being extended to the city. In the third decade of the 19th century, [[Alessandro Manzoni]] wrote his novel ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|I Promessi Sposi]]'', considered the manifesto of Italian Romanticism, which found in Milan its centre, and [[Carlo Porta]] wrote his poems in Western Lombard Language. The periodical ''[[Il Conciliatore]]'' published articles by [[Silvio Pellico]], [[Giovanni Berchet]], [[Ludovico di Breme]], who were both Romantic in poetry and patriotic in politics. After the [[Italian unification|Unification of Italy]] in 1861, Milan lost its political importance; nevertheless it retained a sort of central position in cultural debates. New ideas and movements from other countries of Europe were accepted and discussed: thus [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]] gave birth to an Italian movement, ''[[Verismo]]''. The greatest ''verista'' novelist, [[Giovanni Verga]], was born in Sicily but wrote his most important books in Milan.

In addition to Italian, approximately a third of the population of western Lombardy{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} can speak the [[Western dialects of Lombard language|Western Lombard language]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}, also known as Insubric{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. In Milan, some people (mostly elder ones) of the city (natives but also, less often, immigrants) can speak the traditional [[Milanese]] language —that is to say the urban variety of Western Lombard, which is not to be confused with the Milanese-influenced regional variety of the Italian language.

===Religion===
[[File:Milanoambrogio0002.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio|St. Ambrose Basilica]], one of the city's most important and oldest churches.]]
Milan's population, like that of Italy as a whole, is mostly [[Catholic]]. It is the seat of the Roman Catholic [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|Archdiocese of Milan]]. Other religions practised include: [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Churches]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps.google.it/maps?hl=it&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=chiesa+ortodossa+milano&amp;fb=1&amp;view=text&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local_group&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=more-results&amp;cd=1 |title=chiesa ortodossa milano – Google Maps |publisher=Maps.google.it |accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lankaramaya.com/ |title=Lankarama Buddhist Temple – Milan,Italy |publisher=Lankaramaya.com |accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mosaico-cem.it/ |title=Jewish Community of Milan |publisher=Mosaico-cem.it |accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orthodoxeurope.org/page/8/4.aspx |title=Islam in Italy &quot; Inter-Religious Dialogue &quot; OrthodoxEurope.org |publisher=OrthodoxEurope.org&lt;! |date=4 December 2002 |accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=7230 |title=Milan: The Center for Radical Islam in Europe |publisher=American Chronicle |accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Protestantism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cini |url=http://www.protestantiamilano.it/ |title=Centro Culturale Protestante – Protestanti a Milano delle Chiese Battiste Metodiste Valdesi |language={{It icon}} |publisher=Protestantiamilano.it |accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milanovaldese.it/ |title=Chiesa Evangelica Valdese – Milano |publisher=Milanovaldese.it |accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milan has its own historic Catholic rite known as the [[Ambrosian Rite]] (Italian: ''Rito ambrosiano''). It varies slightly from the typical Catholic rite (the ''Roman'', used in all other western regions), with some differences in the [[liturgy]] and mass celebrations, in the Canons are Easter and Lent, in the colour of liturgical vestments, peculiar use of incense, marriage form, office for the dead, baptism by immersion, and in the calendar (for example, the date for the beginning of [[lent]] is celebrated some days after the common date, so the carnival has different date). The season of Advent is of six weeks duration and starts on the Sunday after the feast of Saint Martin (11 November). The Ambrosian rite is also practised in other surrounding locations in Lombardy, parts of Piedmont and in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] canton of [[Ticino]]. The sounding of church bells uses a peculiar technique. Another important difference concerns the [[liturgical music]]. The [[Gregorian chant]] was completely unused in Milan and surrounding areas, because the official one was its own [[Ambrosian chant]], definitively established by the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563) and earlier than the Gregorian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01389a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Ambrosian Chant |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 March 1907 |accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To preserve this music there has developed the unique ''schola cantorum'', a college, and an Institute called PIAMS (Pontifical Ambrosian Institute of Sacred Music), in partnership with the [[Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music]] (PIMS) in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Emanuele Vecchio |url=http://www.unipiams.org/en/1 |title=PIAMS :: Pontifical Ambrosian Institute of Sacred Music |publisher=Unipiams.org |accessdate=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===

'''Molise''' ({{IPA-it|moˈliːze|pron}}) ([[Neapolitan language|Molisano]]: ''Mulise'') is a [[Regions of Italy|region]] of [[Southern Italy]], the second smallest of the regions. It was formerly (until 1963) part of the region of ''[[Abruzzi e Molise]]'' (with [[Abruzzo]]) and now a separate entity. The region covers 4,438&amp;nbsp;km² and has a population of about 300,000.

Molise is the newest Italian region, since it was established in 1963, when the region Abruzzi e Molise was split in two. It became effective only in 1970.

== Economy ==

Though there is a large [[Fiat]] plant ([[Termoli]]), the industrial sector is dominated by the building industry with small and medium-sized farms spread widely throughout the region. Another important industry is food processing: pasta, meat, milk products, oil and wine are the traditional products of the region. In the services sector the most important industries are distribution, hotels and catering, followed by transport and communications, banking and insurance. With few exceptions, in all sectors firms are small, and this explains the difficulties encountered when marketing products on a national scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itf2_eco.htm |title=Eurostat |publisher=Circa.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[2002 Molise earthquake|earthquake of 2002]] some of the communities in Molise became tt policy which contributed state money to individuals willing to make their homes more resistant to seismic activity.  Larino, near Termoli, was a particular beneficiary of this policy and the town, already one of the most beautiful in the province, has been transformed.  It was policy to return the houses to their historical colours and, based on careful research, the structures were painted in a range of soft pastel tones.  As a result Larino has become an important centre for tourism and scores of expatriates from all over the world are returning to live in the revived centro storico (antique centre).

International tourism is becoming more evident largely as a result of the international flights from other European states, Great Britain, and North America which enter Pescara not far to the north in Abruzzo.  The tourists are attracted by large expanses of unspoiled beaches, a relative lack of congestion, and the gentle pace of life.

The density of the population in Molise is well below the national average. In 2008, Molise registered 72.3 inhabitants per km2, compared to a national figure of 198.8. The region is subdivided into two provinces: Campobasso and Isernia, covering together 1.5% of the Italian territory and less than 1% of its population. The larger province in terms of surface area is Campobasso (2,909 km2) and the smaller is Isernia (1,529 km2). The province of Campobasso is the more densely populated of the two provinces, with 79.4 inhabitants per km2, whereas Isernia registered 58.9 inhabitants per km2.&lt;ref name=&quot;regportraits1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itf2_pop.htm |title=Eurostat |publisher=Circa.europa.eu |date=2001-01-01 |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2008 the most populous towns were Campobasso (51,247 inhabitants), Termoli (32,420) and Isernia (21,811).

In the period 1951-71, large-scale emigration to other countries of the European Union, to other parts of Italy and overseas led to a significant decline in the population of Molise. Negative net migration persisted until 1981. Large-scale emigration has caused many of the smaller towns and villages to lose over 60% of their population, while only a small number of larger towns have recorded significant gains. From 1982 to 1994, net migration has been positive, then followed by a negative trend until 2001. Between 1991 (330,900 inhabitants) and 2001 (320,601 inhabitants), the population of the region decreased by 3.1%;&lt;ref name=&quot;regportraits1&quot;/&gt; since 2001 the population remained stable.

In the region there are two ethnic minorities: the [[Molise Croats|Molisan Croats]] (5,000 people who speak an old Dalmatian dialect of the Croatian language) and the [[Arbëreshë people|Molisan Albanians]] (who speak a divergent variety of Albanian, [[Arbëresh language|Arbëresh]], very different from the Albanian spoken on the other side of the Adriatic Sea). Molisan Albanians are generally of the Byzantine Catholic religion, while Molise Croats are generally Catholics.

== Government and politics ==
{{main|Politics of Molise}}

Although the region has a center-right local government, at the [[Italian general election, 2006|April 2006 elections]], Molise gave 50.5% of its votes to [[Romano Prodi]] of the centre-to-left [[The Olive Tree (political coalition)|Olive Tree]] party. Nonetheless, in November of the same year, Michele Iorio ([[centre-right]] candidate), won the [[regional election]] with over 54% of votes.

== Administrative divisions ==
Molise comprises two provinces:

'''Oscar Luigi Scalfaro''' ({{IPA-it|ˈɔskar luˈiːʤi ˈskalfaro}}; 9 September 1918 – 29 January 2012) was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[politician]] and magistrate, the [[List of Presidents of the Italian Republic|ninth]] [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]] from 1992 to 1999, and subsequently a [[senator for life]]. Formerly a member of [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]], he belonged to the centre-left [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic party]].

==Biography==
Scalfaro was born in [[Novara]], [[Province of Novara]].&lt;ref name=Sen&gt;[http://www.senato.it/leg/16/BGT/Schede/Attsen/00002200.htm Page at Senate website] {{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scalfaro graduated in [[Law]] from the [[Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore]] (”Catholic University of the Sacred Heart“) in [[Milan]] on July 30, 1941 . On October 21, 1942 he entered the magistrature. In 1945, after the end of [[World War II]], he became a public prosecuting attorney, and to date he is the last Italian attorney to have obtained a death sentence: in July of that year, along with two others, he was public prosecutor in the trial against former Novara [[prefect]] Enrico Vezzalini and servicemen Arturo Missiato, Domenico Ricci, Salvatore Santoro, Giovanni Zeno and Raffaele Infante, accused of &quot;collaborating with the German invaders&quot;. After a three-day-long debate, all six were condemned to death. The sentence was carried out on September 23, 1945&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2006/ottobre/14/Scalfaro_figlia_del_fascista_fucilato_co_9_061014017.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;. Later on, he obtained one more death sentence, but the accused was pardoned before the execution could take place. In 1946 he was elected to the [[Constituent Assembly]] and later in 1948 he became a deputy representing the district of [[Turin]]. He was re-elected ten times in a row until 1992. Within the [[Democrazia Cristiana]] party he was associated with its left wing.

On May 25, 1992 he was elected as President of the Italian Republic, after a two week stalemate of unsuccessful attempts to reach agreement. The killing of anti-Mafia magistrate [[Giovanni Falcone]] prompted his election. His mandate ended in May 1999, and he automatically became a lifetime member of the [[Senate of Italy|Senate]].

In recent times, Scalfaro was the chairman of the committee that advocated the abrogation, in the [[referendum]] of June 25 and 26, 2006, of the constitutional reform that had been passed in parliament the previous year by the former center-right majority. Along with all the center-left (and a few center-right personalities, too), Scalfaro considered it to be dangerous for national unity and for other reasons. The opponents of the reform won  a landslide victory in the referendum.

Scalfaro was the oldest surviving former Italian president and the second oldest member of the Senate, after [[Rita Levi-Montalcini]]. He consequently took the temporary presidency of the newly-elected assembly which followed the [[Italian general election, 2006|2006 general election]], as Levi Montalcini refused the role because of her age. This made him one of the three politicians in Italian history to have presided over the three highest-ranked offices in the Italian Republic: President of the Republic, President of the Senate, and President of the Chamber of Deputies; the others are [[Sandro Pertini]] and [[Enrico De Nicola]].

A staunch [[Catholic]], and in the past a rather conservative and [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] politician, Scalfaro nevertheless distrusted many members of the DC who changed support to [[Forza Italia]], and was consistently on bad terms with Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. He openly supported the center-left coalition, which included two [[Communism|communist]] parties, which won the 1996 and 2006 elections. Despite his age, he also actively campaigned, for the &quot;no&quot; side, in the June 2006 referendum on a constitutional reform. This reform had been proposed by Berlusconi's [[House of Freedom]] coalition during its control of the government.

[[File:Oscar_Luigi_Scalfaro_-_2009.jpg|thumb|left|Scalfaro in 2009.]]
During the Second World War, in 1944, Scalfaro lost his 20-year-old wife [[Maria Inzitari]], by whom he had a daughter, Marianna. He never married again.

After the [[Italian general election, 2008|2008 parliamentary election]], he was again asked to preside as ''pro tempore'' Speaker of the Senate after [[Rita Levi-Montalcini]] again refused the post, but this time he also declined to serve.

==Honours and awards==
As President of the Italian Republic, Scalfaro was Head of several Italian Orders: [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]] (28 May 1992 to 15 May 1999), [[Military Order of Italy]], [[Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity]], [[Order of Merit for Labour]] and the [[Order of Vittorio Veneto]]. He was also awarded the Gold Medal for meritorious school, culture and art{{Clarify|date=March 2011}} (July 31, 1973).

He also received several foreign honours:
*Knight of Magistral Grace of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] (1950)
*Bailiff Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta
*Collar of the [[Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana]] (Estonia)
*Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of the White Eagle (Poland)|Order of the White Eagle]] (Poland)
*Knight Grand Cross of the [[Grand Order of King Tomislav]] (&quot;For outstanding contribution to the promotion of friendship and development co-operation between the Republic of Croatia and the Italian Republic.&quot; - 17 December 1997)
*Knight of the [[Order of the Three Stars]], First Class (Latvia)
*Grand Cross of the [[Order of Vytautas the Great]] (Lithuania)
*Order of the Elephant, Denmark (19 October 1993)

{{Politics of Italy}}

The  '''Prime Minister of Italy''' (Italian: ''Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri'', literally '''President of the Council of Ministers''') is the [[head of government]] of the [[Italy|Italian Republic]]. 

While the office is similar to those in most other [[parliamentary system]]s, the Italian prime minister has less authority than some of his counterparts. The prime minister is not authorized to request the dissolution of the [[Parliament of Italy]] or to dismiss ministers, and must receive a vote of approval from the [[Council of Ministers of Italy|Council of Ministers]]—which holds effective executive power—to execute most political activities.

The office was established by Articles 92 through to 96 of the current [[Constitution of Italy]]. The prime minister is appointed by the [[President of Italy|President of the Republic]] after each general election. Commonly referred to in Italy as ''[[premier]]'', the right title of the office holder is ''Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri'', or just ''Presidente del Consiglio''. The formal [[Italian order of precedence]] lists the office as being ceremonially the fourth most important Italian state office.
==History==
The office was first established in 1848 in Italy's predecessor state, the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]—although it was not mentioned in the constitution, the [[Albertine Statute]]. The candidate for office was appointed by the [[King of Italy|king]], and presided over a very unstable political system. In its first 60 years of existence (1861-1921), Italy changed its prime minister 37 times. Regarding this situation, the first goal of [[Benito Mussolini]], [[March on Rome|appointed in 1922]], was to abolish the Parliament's ability to put him to a [[vote of no confidence]], thus basing his power on the will of the king and the [[National Fascist Party]] alone. With the proclamation of the Italian Republic in 1946, the office received constitutional recognition, but it returned to its traditional instability: 25 men assumed the office in 65 years.

==Functions==
In addition to powers inherent in being a member of the cabinet, the prime minister holds specific powers, most notably being able to nominate a list of cabinet ministers to be appointed by the President of the Republic and the countersigning of all legislative instruments having the force of law that are signed by the President of the Republic.

Article 95 of the Italian constitution provides that &quot;the prime minister directs and coordinates the activity of the ministers&quot;. This power has been used to a quite variable extent in the [[History of Italy|history of the Italian state]], as it is strongly influenced by the political strength of individual ministers and thus by the parties they represent.

Often the prime minister's activity consists more in mediating between the various parties in the majority coalition, rather than directing the activity of the Council of Ministers. The prime minister's supervisory power is further limited by the lack of any formal authority to fire ministers, although a cabinet reshuffle (''rimpasto''), or sometimes even an 'individual [[motion of no confidence|vote of no confidence]]' on the part of Parliament, may in practice provide a surrogate measure.

The recent{{when?|date=November 2011}} rise of a new mode of politics, which according to some{{to whom?|date=November 2011}} is ever more linked to the mediating skills of politicians, and the enactment of majoritarian electoral laws have, in practice, given the prime minister a greater power to make decisions and to direct the internal dynamics of the government.

'''Roberto Maroni''' (born March 15, 1955) is an [[Italy|Italian]] politician from [[Varese]]. He is a member of the [[Northern League (Italy)|Northern League]] ([[Italian language|Italian:]] ''Lega Nord'') political movement. Since 1992 he is a [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Member of the Chamber of Duputies]] of the [[Italian Republic]], always elected in [[Lombardy]]'s districts and costituencies. He was [[Italian Minister of the Interior|Interior Minister]] of the [[Italian Republic]] from [[1994]] to [[1995]] and from [[2008]] to [[2011]].

==Career==
In 1979, he received a law degree, with a dissertation in [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil Law]], from the [[Universita degli Studi di Milano|University of Milan]]. He became a lawyer after spending two years working as a Legal Affairs Manager for various companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/speaker/0,2879,en_21571361_34360727_34508996_1_1_1_1,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, he was elected Province Secretary of the  [[Northern League (Italy)|Northern League]]  in [[Province of Varese|Varese]]. He also became a town councilor in [[Varese]] that year. Two years later, he was elected Chairman of the  [[Northern League (Italy)|Northern League]] Parliamentary Group. He also entered the party's Federal Council and campaigned heavily for the Northern League prior to Berlusconi's first Cabinet.

He had already served as [[Italian Minister of the Interior|Minister of the Interior]] during the first [[Silvio Berlusconi]] administration, from 1994 to 1995. He also served as [[Minister of Labour (Italy)|Minister of Labour and Welfare]] from 2001 until May 2006 during [[Berlusconi]]'s second and third governments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/speaker/0,2879,en_21571361_34360727_34508996_1_1_1_1,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, after Berlusconi narrowly lost his re-election bid to [[Romano Prodi]], Maroni alleged problems with the election comparable to those in [[United States presidential election, 2000#Controversy in Florida|Florida]] during the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 Presidential election]]. &quot;The level pegging is very similar to what happened in Florida. With one vote more or one vote less, you lose or you win,&quot; he said.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2006-04/11/content_565129.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Italian general election, 2008|2008 electoral victory]] of the centre-right coalition in [[Italy]] he assumed the office of Minister of the Interior in the cabinet led by [[Silvio Berlusconi]].

Following Silvio Berlusconi's departure from office, he currently leads with its party the Northern League a fierce and demagogic opposition to Mario Monti's government.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2011/11/21/news/maroni_opposizione-25336180/?ref=HREA-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passion for music==
In September 2006, Maroni told ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' that he downloads music illegally and thinks music should be &quot;free and accessible to all&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117950064?categoryid=19&amp;cs=1&lt;/ref&gt; He added that authors should still be able to stop their work from being widely distributed on the [[Internet]]. Maroni said his confession was intended to spark a discussion in [[Parliament of Italy|Parliament]] about changing Italy's copyright laws, which are among the strictest in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117950064?categoryid=19&amp;cs=1&lt;/ref&gt;

Maroni himself is also a musician, playing keyboards in the &quot;Distretto 51&quot; [[Soul music|soul]] band from the 80's.

==Conviction==
Maroni was convicted of resistance against a public official during a police raid of his party's building in via Bellerio in [[Milan]] in 1996, and sentenced to 8 months (later changed into a fine), when police  inspected his office.

'''Romano Prodi''' ({{IPA-it|roˈmaːno ˈprɔːdi|-|It-Romano Prodi.ogg}}; born 9 August 1939) is an [[Politics of Italy|Italian politician]] and statesman. He served as the [[Prime Minister of Italy]], from 17 May 1996 to 21 October 1998 and from 17 May 2006 to 8 May 2008. He was also the [[President of the European Commission#List of presidents|tenth President]] of the [[European Commission]] from 1999 to 2004.

Prodi ran in 1996 as lead candidate of [[The Olive Tree (political coalition)|The Olive Tree]] coalition, winning the [[Italian general election, 1996|general election]] and serving as [[Prime Minister of Italy]] until 1998. Following the victory of his coalition [[The Union (political coalition)|The Union]] over the [[House of Freedoms]] led by [[Silvio Berlusconi]] in the [[Italian general election, 2006|April 2006 Italian elections]] Prodi was in power again. On 24 January 2008, he lost a vote of confidence in the Senate house, and consequently tendered his resignation as Prime Minister to [[President of Italy|Italian President]] [[Giorgio Napolitano]], but continued in office for almost four months for routine business, until early elections were held and a new government was formed.

On 14 October 2007, Prodi became the first President of the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] upon foundation of the party.

On 12 September 2008, [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] selected Prodi as president of the [[African Union]]-UN peacekeeping panel.&lt;ref&gt;

==Personal==
Prodi was born in [[Scandiano]], in the [[province of Reggio Emilia]] ([[Emilia-Romagna]]). He is the eighth of nine children of [[Mario Prodi]], an engineer originally from a peasant family, and Enrica, a primary school teacher. He has two sisters and six brothers, five of them being like him university professors (one of whom, [[Vittorio Prodi]], is also a [[Member of the European Parliament]]; see also [[Giorgio Prodi]], an [[oncology|oncologist]] and [[biosemiotics|biosemiotician]]).

Prodi married [[Flavia Franzoni]] in 1969.  He was married by then-priest [[Camillo Ruini]], now a well-known [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/299254.stm|title=Profile: Romano Prodi |accessdate=25 February 2007 |date=10 May 1999 |author=|work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/04/11/news/prodi.php|title=A tenuous time for Mr. Serenity|accessdate=25 February 2007 |date=12 April 2006 |author=Fisher, Ian|work=[[International Herald Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have two sons, Giorgio and Antonio. He and his family still live in [[Bologna]].

==Academic career==
After completing his secondary education at the  ''Liceo Ludovico Ariosto'' in Reggio Emilia, Prodi graduated in law at the [[Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore|Catholic University of the Sacred Heart]], Milan in 1961, with a [[thesis]] on the role of [[Protectionism]] in the development of Italian industry. He then carried out postgraduate studies at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romanoprodi.it/cgi-bin/adon.cgi?act=doc&amp;doc=28 Biography of Romano Prodi] (in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, he became a [[teaching assistant]] for [[Beniamino Andreatta]] in the Department of Economics and the Faculty of [[Political Science]] at the [[University of Bologna]], subsequently serving as associate professor (1966) and finally (1971–1999) as Professor  of Industrial Organisation and Industrial Policy. Prodi has also been a visiting professor at [[Harvard University]] and a researcher at the [[Stanford Research Institute]]. His research covers mainly [[Competition regulator|competition regulations]] and the development of small and medium businesses. He is also interested in relations between states and markets, and the dynamics of the different capitalistic models.

Prodi has received almost 20 honorary degrees from institutions in Italy, and from the rest of Europe, North America, Asia, and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.romanoprodi.it/cgi-bin/adon.cgi?act=doc&amp;doc=28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
===Early political career===
Prodi's political career began as a left-of-centre reformist [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrat]] and a disciple of [[Beniamino Andreatta]], another economist turned politician. During the mid-1970s he was appointed [[Italian Minister of Economic Development|Minister of Industry]]. During [[Giulio Andreotti]]'s government in 1978, he served as a ''Technical Minister''; through the 1980s and early 1990s he continuously served various government committees.

On 2 April 1978, Prodi and other teachers at the [[University of Bologna]] passed on a tip-off that revealed the whereabouts of the [[safe house]] where the kidnapped [[Aldo Moro]], the former Prime Minister, was being held captive by the [[Red Brigades]]. Prodi claimed he had been given this tip-off by the founders of the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] party, contacted from beyond the grave via a [[séance]] and a [[Ouija|Ouija board]]. Whilst during this supposed séance Prodi thought the word Gradoli referred to a town on the outskirts of Rome, it probably referred to the Roman address of a Red Brigades safe house, located at no. 96, Via Gradoli. Later, other Italian members of the [[European Commission]] claimed Prodi had invented this story to conceal the real source of the tip-off, which they believed to have originated somewhere among the far-left Italian political groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/eurocommission/Story/0,2763,206412,00.html |title=Seance points to problem for Prodi|accessdate=25 February 2007 |date=3 August 1999|author=Willan, Philip|work=The Guardian |location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This issue came back again in 2005, when Prodi was accused of being &quot;a [[KGB]] man&quot; by [[Mario Scaramella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/europe/the-seance-that-came-back-to-haunt-romano-prodi-517786.html |title='Multiple attempts' on Litvinenko|date=22 January 2007|work=BBC|location=London|deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=November 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same accusation was raised in the 1990s by the [[Mitrokhin Archive|Mitrokhin Commission]].

From 1982–1989 and 1993–1994 Prodi, an expert economist and negotiator, was CEO of the powerful state-owned industrial holding company [[Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale|IRI]]. Though in this position he twice came under investigation – firstly for an alleged conflict of interest in relation to contracts awarded to his own economic research company, and secondly concerning the sale of the loss-making state-owned food conglomerate SME to the multinational [[Unilever]], for which he had, for a time, been a paid consultant – however he was fully acquitted on both counts.

===Olive Tree and first cabinet (1996–1998)===
{{See also|Italian general election, 1996|The Olive Tree (political coalition)}}

[[File:Logo Ulivo 2006.png|thumb|left|100px|[[The Olive Tree (political coalition)|Olive Tree]] logo.]]

In 1995, Prodi was one of the founders of the centre-left coalition [[The Olive Tree (political coalition)|The Olive Tree]], and as its main leader he defeated the [[Silvio Berlusconi]]-led centre-right [[Pole of Freedoms]] coalition in the [[Italian general election, 1996|1996 Italian general election]]. This led to Prodi's nomination as President of the Council of Ministers, as the position of Prime Minister is usually called in Italy. Prodi's programme consisted in continuing the past governments' work of restoration of the country's economic health, in order to pursue the then seemingly unreachable goal of leading the country within the strict [[European Monetary System]] parameters and make the country join the [[Euro]] currency. He succeeded in this in little more than six months. His government fell in 1998 when the [[Communist Refoundation Party]] withdrew its support. This led to the formation of a new government led by [[Massimo D'Alema]] as Prime Minister. There are those who claim that D'Alema deliberately engineered the collapse of the Prodi government to become Prime Minister himself.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} As the result of a vote of no confidence in Prodi's government, D'Alema's nomination was passed by a single vote. This was the first and so far, the only occasion in the history of the Italian republic on which a vote of no confidence had ever been called; the Republic's many previous governments had been brought down by a majority &quot;no&quot; vote on some crucially important piece of legislation (such as the budget).

===President of the European Commission (1999–2004)===
{{Main|Prodi Commission}}

[[File:Prodi Commission 1999.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Prodi Commission]] in 1999.]]

[[Image:Bush Persson Prodi.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Romano Prodi (right) with [[Göran Persson]] and [[George W. Bush]] at [[Gunnebo Slott]] near [[Gothenburg]], Sweden, 14 June 2001.]]

In September 1999 Prodi, a prominent pro-European, became [[President of the European Commission]], thanks to the support of both the conservative [[European People's Party]] and social-democratic [[Party of European Socialists]] in the European Parliament. It was during Prodi's presidency, in 2002, that eleven EU member states abandoned their national currencies and adopted the Euro as their single currency. This commission (the 10th) saw in increase in power and influence following [[Amsterdam Treaty]]. Some in the media described President Prodi as being the first &quot;Prime Minister of the European Union&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/1999/04/16/eu.2.t_0.php Prodi to Have Wide, New Powers as Head of the European Commission] iht.com 16 April 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_39/b3648256.htm Commentary: Romano Prodi: Europe's First Prime Minister? (int'l edition)] Businessweek.com 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2004, still during Prodi's presidency, the EU was enlarged to admit several more member nations, most formerly part of the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet bloc]]. As well as the enlargement and Amsterdam Treaty, the Prodi Commission also saw the signing and enforcement of the [[Treaty of Nice]] as well as the conclusion and signing of the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]]: in which he introduced the &quot;Convention method&quot; of negotiation. Prodi's mandate expired on 18 November 2004, whereupon he returned to domestic politics.

===Prodi's return to Italian politics and his second government (2006–2008)===
{{See also|Italian general election, 2006|Prodi II Cabinet}}

Shortly before the end of his term as President of the European Commission, Prodi returned to national Italian politics at the helm of the enlarged centre-left coalition, [[The Union (political coalition)|The Union]].

Having no party of his own, in order to officially state his candidacy for the [[Italian general election, 2006|2006 general election]], Prodi came up with the idea of an apposite [[primary election]], the first of such kind to be ever introduced in Europe and seen by its creator (Prodi himself) as a democratic move to bring the public and its opinion closer to the Italian politics, held on 16 October 2005, which he won with over 70% of votes. Over four million people for the occasion went to cast a vote in the primary election. He thus led his coalition to the electoral campaign preceding the election, eventually won by a very narrow margin of 25,000 votes, and a final majority of two seats in the [[Senate of Italy|Senate]], on 10 April. Prodi's appointment was somewhat delayed, as the outgoing President of the Republic, [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]], ended his mandate in May, not having enough time for the usual procedure (consultations made by the President, appointment of a Prime Minister, motion of confidence and oath of office). After the acrimonious [[Italian presidential election, 2006|election]] of [[Giorgio Napolitano]] to replace Ciampi, Prodi could proceed with his transition to government. On 16 May he was invited by Napolitano to form a government. The following day, 17 May 2006, Prodi and his [[Prodi II Cabinet|second cabinet]] were sworn into office.

[[File:33rdG8Leaders.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Romano Prodi (second from the right) at the [[33rd G8 summit|Helligendamm G8 Summit]], 6–8 June 2007.]]

Prodi's new cabinet drew in politicians from across his centre-left winning coalition, in addition to [[Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa]], an unelected former official of the [[European Central Bank]] with no partisan membership. Romano Prodi obtained the support for his cabinet on 19 May at the [[Senate of Italy|Senate]] and on 23 May at the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]]. Also on 18 May, Prodi laid out some sense of his new [[foreign policy]] when he pledged to withdraw Italian troops from [[Iraq]] and called the [[Iraq war]] a &quot;grave mistake that has not solved but increased the problem of security&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,,1778041,00.html |title=Prodi condemns Iraq war as 'grave mistake' |accessdate=25 February 2007 |date=18 May 2006 |author=Sturcke, James|work=The Guardian |location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coalition led by Romano Prodi, thanks to the electoral law which gave the winner a sixty seat majority, can count on a good majority in the Chamber of Deputies but only on a very narrow majority in the Senate. The composition of the coalition was heterogeneous, combining parties of [[communism|communist]] ideology, the [[Party of Italian Communists]] and [[Communist Refoundation Party]], within the same government as parties of [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] inspiration, [[Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy]] and [[UDEUR Populars for the South|UDEUR Populars]]. The latter was led by [[Clemente Mastella]], former chairman of Christian Democracy. Therefore, according to critics,{{by whom|date=November 2011}} it was difficult to have a single policy in different key areas, such as economics and foreign politics (for instance, Italian military presence in [[Afghanistan]]). In his earlier months as PM, Prodi had a key role in the creation of a multinational peacekeeping force in [[Lebanon]] following the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]].

Prodi's government faced a crisis over policies in early 2007, after just nine months of government. Three ministers in Prodi's Cabinet boycotted a vote in January to continue funding for Italian troop deployments in Afghanistan. Lawmakers approved the expansion of the US military base [[Caserma Ederle]] at the end of January, but the victory was so narrow that Deputy Prime Minister Francesco Rutelli criticised members of the coalition who had not supported the government. At around the same time, [[Italian Minister of Justice|Justice Minister]] [[Clemente Mastella]], of the coalition member UDEUR Populars, said he would rather see the government fall than support its unwed couples legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6324829.stm|title=Rift threatens Italian coalition|accessdate=25 February 2007 |date=2 February 2007 |author=|work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tens of thousands of people marched in [[Vicenza]] against the expansion of Caserma Ederle, which saw the participation of some leading far-left members of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6370671.stm|title=Italians march in US base protest|accessdate=25 February 2007 |date=17 February 2007 |author=|work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Harsh debates followed in the Italian Senate on 20 February 2007. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister [[Massimo D'Alema]] declared during an official visit in [[Ibiza]], Spain that, without a majority on foreign policy affairs, the government would resign. The following day, D'Alema gave a speech at the Senate representing the government, clarifying his foreign policy and asking the [[Italian Senate|Senate]] to vote for or against it. In spite of the fear of many senators that Prodi's defeat would return [[Silvio Berlusconi]] to power, the Senate did not approve a motion backing Prodi's government foreign policy, two votes shy of the required majority of 160.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2007/02/21/italy-prodi.html|title=Italian PM Prodi resigns after foreign policy defeat|accessdate=25 February 2007 |date=21 February 2007 |work=[[CBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a Government meeting on 21 February, Romano Prodi tendered his resignation to the President [[Giorgio Napolitano]], who cut short an official visit to [[Bologna]] in order to receive the Prime Minister. Prodi's spokesman indicated that he would only agree to form a new Government &quot;if, and only if, he is guaranteed the full support of all the parties in the majority from now on.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Italian PM hands in resignation&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/6383051.stm |title=Italian PM hands in resignation |accessdate=24 February 2007 |date=21 February 2007 |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 February, centre-left coalition party leaders backed a non-negotiable list of twelve political conditions given by Prodi as conditions of his remaining in office. President Napolitano held talks with political leaders on 23 February to decide whether to confirm Prodi's Government, ask Prodi to form a new government or call fresh elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Italian coalition 'to back Prodi'&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6388455.stm |title=Italian coalition 'to back Prodi|accessdate=24 February 2007 |date=23 February 2007 |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following these talks, on 24 February, President Napolitano asked Prodi to remain in office but to submit to a vote of confidence in both houses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Italian coalition 'to back Prodi'&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Italian PM asked to resume duties&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6391669.stm |title=Italian PM asked to resume duties |accessdate=24 February 2007 |date=24 February 2007 |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;I will seek a vote of confidence as soon as possible, with renewed impetus and a united and determined coalition,&quot; Prodi said after meeting with President Giorgio Napolitano.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/2/24/143221.shtml Italy's Leader Asks Premier to Stay on]. [[Associated Press]], 25 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 February, the Senate voted to grant confidence to Prodi's Government.  Though facing strong opposition from the centre-right coalition, the vote resulted in a 162–157 victory. Prodi then faced a vote of confidence in the lower house on 2 March, which he won as expected with a large majority of 342–198.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/03/02/italy.prodi.reut/index.html | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 October 2007, Prodi oversaw the merger of two main parties of the Italian centre-left, [[Democrats of the Left]] and [[Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy]], creating the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]]. Prodi himself led the merger of the two parties, which had been planned over a twelve-year period, and became the first President of the party. He announced his resignation from that post on 16 April 2008, two days after the Democratic Party's defeat in the general election.

===2008 crisis and resignation===
{{See also|2008 Italian political crisis}}

In early January 2008, [[Italian Minister of Justice|Justice Minister]] and [[UDEUR Populars for the South|UDEUR Populars]] leader [[Clemente Mastella]] resigned after his wife Sandra Lonardo was put under house arrest for [[political corruption|corruption]] charges. He initially announced external support for the government, only to withdraw it a few days later citing lack of solidarity from the majority parties, and declaring his party would vote against the government bills since then. With three Senators, UDEUR was instrumental to ensure a narrow centre-left majority in the Italian Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7194342.stm|publisher=BBC News |title=Italy's ruling coalition weakened|date=17 January 2008|accessdate=24 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 January 2008, Prodi became the Minister of Justice ''ad interim''.

This caused Prodi to ask for a confidence vote in both Chambers: he won a clear majority in the Chamber of Deputies on 23 January,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7205578.stm|publisher=BBC News |title=Embattled Italy PM backed by MPs|date=23 January 2008|accessdate=24 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was defeated 156 to 161 (with 1 abstention)&lt;ref&gt;http://it.wikinews.org/wiki/Crisi_di_governo:_il_Senato_sfiducia_Prodi&lt;/ref&gt; in the Senate the next day. He consequently tendered his resignation as Prime Minister to President [[Giorgio Napolitano]], who accepted it and appointed the President of the Senate, [[Franco Marini]], with the task of evaulating the possibility to form an interim government to implement electoral reforms prior to holding elections. Marini, after consultation with all major political forces, acknowledged the impossibility of doing so on 5 February, forcing Napolitano to announce the end of the legislature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ansa scioglimento&quot;&gt;{{it icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.ansa.it/opencms/export/site/visualizza_fdg.html_12342748.html |title=DOMANI LO SCIOGLIMENTO DELLE CAMERE |publisher=[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|Ansa]] |author=|date=5 February 2008 |accessdate=5 February 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080204214404/http://www.ansa.it/opencms/export/site/visualizza_fdg.html_12342748.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 4 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prodi said that he would not seek to lead a new government.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Davis and Steve Scherer, [http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a773AGctFECE&amp;refer=home &quot;Prodi Government Near Collapse After Key Ally Defects (Update2)&quot;], Bloomberg.com, 22 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Italian general election, 2008|election]] that followed in April 2008, Berlusconi's centre-right [[The People of Freedom]] and allies defeated the Democratic Party.

==After politics==

On 19 March 2008, during the political campaign for the snap general election, Romano Prodi stated &quot;I called it a day with Italian politics and maybe with politics in general.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansa.it/opencms/export/site/visualizza_fdg.html_18938668.html|title=Prodi, lascio la politica ma il mondo è pieno di occasioni|author=ANSA|accessdate=3 September 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080330070541/http://www.ansa.it/opencms/export/site/visualizza_fdg.html_18938668.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 30 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 September 2008, Prodi was named by the UN as head of a joint [[African Union|AU]]-UN panel aimed at enhancing peacekeeping operations in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N12513725.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 February 2009, he was appointed Professor-at-Large at the [[Watson Institute for International Studies]] of [[Brown University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Silvio Berlusconi''' ({{IPA-it|ˈsilvjo berluˈskoːni|-|It-Silvio_Berlusconi.ogg}}; born 29 September 1936), also known as ''Il Cavaliere'' (literally, The Knight) – from knighthood to the [[Order of Merit for Labour]] which he received in 1977&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/6/49/45220608.pdf The Rt. Hon. Silvio Berlusconi, Prime Minister] Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Retrieved 11 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; – is an [[Politics of Italy|Italian politician]] and [[businessman]] who served three terms as [[Prime Minister of Italy]], from 1994 to 1995, 2001 to 2006, and 2008 to 2011. Berlusconi is also the controlling shareholder of [[Mediaset]] and owner of [[A.C. Milan]].

Berlusconi is the [[List of Italian Prime Ministers by time in office|longest-serving]] post-war Prime Minister of Italy, and [[List of Italian Prime Ministers by time in office|third longest-serving]] since [[Unification of Italy|Italy's unification]], after [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Giovanni Giolitti]], holding three separate terms. Technically, he has been sworn in four times because after a [[cabinet reshuffle]], as happened with Berlusconi in 2005, the new ministry is sworn in and subjected to a [[vote of confidence]]. He is the leader of the [[The People of Freedom|People of Freedom]] political movement, a centre-right party he founded in 2009. From November 2009 to November 2011, he was the [[List of longest serving G8 leaders|most senior leader]] of the [[G8]] countries. In 2011, ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine ranked him as the 118th richest man in the world with a net worth of US$6.2 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.forbes.com/profile/silvio-berlusconi/ | title =  Forbes Silvio Berlusconi profile page |date= 11 March 2011 |work=Forbes |accessdate=14 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berlusconi's political rise was rapid and surrounded by some controversy. He was elected as a [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Member of the Chamber of Deputies]] for the first time and appointed as Prime Minister following the [[Italian general election, 1994|March 1994 parliamentary elections]], when [[Forza Italia]] gained a relative majority a mere three months after having been officially launched. However, his cabinet collapsed after nine months, due to internal disagreements in his coalition. In the [[Italian general election, 1996|April 1996 snap parliamentary elections]], Berlusconi was defeated by the centre-left candidate [[Romano Prodi]]. In the [[Italian general election, 2001|May 2001 parliamentary elections]], he was again the centre-right candidate for Prime Minister and won against the centre-left candidate [[Francesco Rutelli]]. Berlusconi then formed his second and third cabinets, until 2006.

Berlusconi was leader of the centre-right coalition in the [[Italian general election, 2006|April 2006 parliamentary elections]], which he lost by a very narrow margin, his opponent again being Romano Prodi. He was re-elected in the [[Italian general election, 2008|parliamentary elections of April 2008]] following the collapse of [[Prodi II Cabinet|Prodi's government]] and sworn in for a third time as Prime Minister on 8 May 2008.

Berlusconi was criticised for his dominance over the Italian media whilst he held political office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13755610 | title = Italians find voice and punish Silvio Berlusconi|publisher=BBC |date=13 June 2011 |accessdate=8 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His broadcasting company [[Mediaset]] is the largest in the country and Berlusconi never fulfilled his election promises to sell off his assets in the company to avoid a [[conflict of interest]]. His leadership was also undermined by [[Silvio Berlusconi underage prostitution charges|sex scandals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44567847/ns/world_news-europe/t/opponents-tell-berlusconi-quit-over-sex-scandal/ | title = Opponents tell Berlusconi to quit over sex scandal |publisher=MSNBC |date=18 September 2011 |accessdate=1 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After losing his majority in parliament amid growing fiscal problems related to the [[European debt crisis]], Berlusconi officially [[Resignation of Silvio Berlusconi|resigned]] as Prime Minister on 16 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15708729 Italy crisis: Silvio Berlusconi resigns as PM] [[BBC News]] 12 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family background and personal life ==
Berlusconi was born in [[Milan]] in 1936. He was raised there in a middle-class family.&lt;ref&gt;Willey, David (2011). [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15629283 The secret of Silvio Berlusconi's success], ''BBC News'' website, bbc.co.uk. Retrieved 9 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Luigi Berlusconi (1908–1989) was a bank employee and his mother, Rosa Bossi (1911–2008), a housewife.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} Silvio was the first of three children; he had a sister, Maria Francesca Antonietta Berlusconi (1943–2009) and has a brother, Paolo Berlusconi (born 1949), both entrepreneurs.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

After completing his secondary school education at a [[St Francis de Sales|Salesian]] college, he studied law at the [[University of Milan|Università Statale]] in Milan, graduating (with honor) in 1961 with a thesis on the legal aspects of advertising. Berlusconi was not required to serve the standard one-year stint in the [[Italian army]] which was compulsory at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

However, this did not constitute reasonable grounds for exemption }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his university studies he was a [[Double bass|upright bass]] player in a group formed with the now [[Mediaset]] Chairman and amateur pianist Fedele Confalonieri and occasionally performed as a [[cruise ship]] [[crooner]]. In later life he wrote AC Milan's [[anthem]] with the Italian music producer and pop singer Tony Renis and Forza Italia's anthem with the opera director Renato Serio. With the [[Naples|Neapolitan]] singer Mariano Apicella he wrote two [[Neapolitan song]] albums: ''Meglio 'na canzone'' in 2003 and ''L'ultimo amore'' in 2006. Berlusconi also owns the [[Serie A]] Club [[AC Milan]].

In 1965, he married Carla Elvira Dall'Oglio, and they had two children: [[Marina Berlusconi|Maria Elvira]], better known as Marina (born 1966), and [[Pier Silvio Berlusconi|Pier Silvio]] (b. 1969).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} By 1980, Berlusconi had established a relationship with the actress [[Veronica Lario]] (born Miriam Bartolini), with whom he subsequently had three children: Barbara (b. 1984), Eleonora (b. 1986) and Luigi (b. 1988). He was divorced from Dall'Oglio in 1985, and married Lario in 1990. By this time, Berlusconi was a well-known entrepreneur, and his wedding was a notable social event. One of his [[Wedding ceremony participants#Best man|best men]] was former Prime Minister and leader of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] [[Bettino Craxi]]. In May 2009, Lario announced that she was to file for divorce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_2009&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | title = Berlusconi's wife to divorce him | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8031520.stm |date=3 May 2009 |publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business career ==
=== ''Milano Due'' ===
Berlusconi's business career began in construction early in the 1960s. After a couple of successful projects, in the late 1960s he carried out the construction of ''[[Milano Due]]'', a huge residential project of about 10,500 apartments, which he eventually built in [[Segrate]], an eastern suburb of [[Milan]].

=== Telemilano ===
Berlusconi first entered the media world in 1973 by setting up a small cable television company, 'Telemilano', to service units built on his Segrate properties. It began transmitting in September the following year. After buying two further channels, Berlusconi relocated the station to central Milan in 1977 and began broadcasting over the airwaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fininvest ===
In 1978 Berlusconi founded his first media group, [[Fininvest]], and joined the [[Propaganda Due]] masonic lodge. In the five years leading up to 1983 he earned some 113&amp;nbsp;billion [[Italian lira]]s ([[euro|€]]58.3&amp;nbsp;million). The funding sources are still unknown because of the complex system of [[holding company|holding companies]] that makes them impossible to trace, despite investigations conducted by various [[state attorney]]s.

Fininvest soon expanded into a country-wide network of local TV stations which had similar programming, forming, in effect, a single national network. This was seen as breaching the Italian public broadcaster [[RAI]]'s statutory monopoly on creating a national network which was later abolished. In 1980, Berlusconi founded Italy's first private national network, [[Canale 5]], followed shortly thereafter by [[Italia 1]] which was bought from the Rusconi family in 1982, and [[Rete 4]], which was bought from [[Mondadori]] in 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;lunita&quot; /&gt;

Berlusconi was assisted in his successful effort to create the first and only Italian commercial TV empire by his connections to Bettino Craxi, secretary-general of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] and also prime minister of Italy at that time, whose government passed, on 20 October 1984, an emergency decree legalising the nationwide transmissions made by Berlusconi's television stations.&lt;ref name=&quot;lunita&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.articolo21.info/499/editoriale/berlusconi-tv-un-impero-nato-per-decretocraxi.html | title = Berlusconi- tv. Un impero nato per decreto-Craxi|language=Italian|publisher=[[l'Unità]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was because, on 16 October 1984, judges in [[Turin]], [[Pescara]] and Rome, enforcing a law which previously restricted nationwide broadcasting to RAI, had ordered these private networks to cease transmitting.

After some political turmoil in 1985 the decree was approved definitively. But for some years, Berlusconi's three channels remained in a legal limbo, and were not therefore allowed, for instance, to broadcast news and political commentary. They were elevated to the status of full national TV channels in 1990 by the so-called Mammì law.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In 1995, Berlusconi sold a portion of his media holdings, first to the German media group [[Kirch Group]] (now bankrupted) and then by public offer. In 1999 Berlusconi expanded his media interests by forming a partnership with Kirch called the ''Epsilon MediaGroup''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

{{Main|Trials and allegations involving Silvio Berlusconi}}

=== Allegations ===
Silvio Berlusconi has an extensive record of criminal allegations, including [[mafia]] collusion, false accounting, tax [[fraud]], corruption and bribery of police officers and judges.
Berlusconi has been tried in Italian courts in several cases. In three of these cases accusations were dropped by the judiciary because of laws passed by Berlusconi's [[parliamentary majority]] shortening the time limit for prosecution of various offences and making false accounting illegal only if there is a specific damaged party reporting the fact to the authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_2005&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.repubblica.it/2005/i/sezioni/cronaca/allibe/allibe/allibe.html | title = All Iberian, Berlusconi assolto &quot;Falso in bilancio non è più reato&quot;|language=Italian|work=la Repubblica|date=26 September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_2002&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2002/07/05/caso-lentini-reati-prescritti.html | title = Caso Lentini, reati prescritti|language=Italian|work=la Repubblica|date=5 July 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In all of them, but one, either he was [[acquitted]] by a court of first instance or on appeal, or charges were dropped because the [[statute of limitations]] had expired.

=== False testimony ===
[[File:Ricevuta di pagamento per l'iscrizione del dott. Silvio Berlusconi alla loggia massonica P2.gif|thumb|Receipt for membership of Silvio Berlusconi to &quot;[[Propaganda Due|Propaganda 2]]&quot; (P2) masonic lodge]]
In 1981, a scandal arose after the police discovery of [[Licio Gelli]]'s secret quasi-Masonic lodge [[Propaganda Due|Propaganda 2]] (P2), which aimed to change the Italian political system to a more [[authoritarian]] regime. The list of people involved in P2 included members of the secret services and some prominent characters from political arena, business, military and media. Silvio Berlusconi, who was then just starting to gain popularity as the founder and owner of &quot;Canale 5&quot; TV channel, was listed as a member of P2.&lt;ref name=vf0706&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2006/07/yellowcake200607?printable=true&amp;currentPage=all | title = The War They Wanted, the Lies They Needed|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=commission&gt;Proceedings of the parliamentary inquiry commission headed by [[Tina Anselmi]]&lt;/ref&gt; The P2 lodge was dissolved by the Italian Parliament in December 1981 and a law was passed declaring similar organisations illegal, but no specific crimes were alleged against individual members of the P2 lodge. While the Italian Constitution had forbidden secret associations since 1948, no penal law provision had ever been passed by Parliament to enact that, and in the Italian legal system an action cannot be a crime if no law declaring that action a crime was in force when the action was committed. Thus, members of the P2 were members of anti-Constitutional and yet not illegal ''per se'' association.

Berlusconi later (in 1989) sued three journalists for libel for writing articles hinting at his involvement in financial crimes. In court, he declared that he had joined the P2 lodge &quot;only for a very short time before the scandal broke&quot; and &quot;he had not even paid the entry fee&quot;. Such statements conflicted with the findings of the parliamentary inquiry commission appointed to investigate the lodge's activity, with material evidence, and even with previous testimony of Berlusconi, all of which proved that he had actually been a member of P2 since 1978 and had indeed paid 100,000 Italian liras (approximately equivalent to 300 euros today) as an entry fee.
In 1990 the [[Court of Appeals|court of appeal]] of Venice found Berlusconi guilty of [[false testimony]] in front of the Court of Verona, however the court could not pass sentence as the offense had been pardoned by an [[amnesty]] passed in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

=== Jowell controversy/David Mills bribery case ===
{{Main|Tessa Jowell financial allegations}}
[[David Mills (lawyer)|David Mills]], lawyer husband of the former British cabinet minister [[Tessa Jowell]], acted for Berlusconi in the early 1990s, and was later accused by Italian prosecutors of [[money laundering]] and of accepting a gift from Berlusconi in return for witness evidence favourable to Berlusconi given in court. Mills claimed that the money in question came not from Berlusconi but from another client. Tessa Jowell then announced her separation from Mills, which some of the [[Media of the United Kingdom|UK media]] suggested was an attempt to distance herself from a potential scandal. She also denied having discussed the money with her husband; ''[[Private Eye]]'' magazine published a satirical front cover of Jowell with a speech bubble stating: &quot;I have never met my husband&quot;. In December 2010, information obtained by the Wikileaks website revealed Mr Berlusconi had become very fond of Ms Jowell, referring to her in private company as 'piccolo puntaspilli' (the little pincushion).{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Personal fortune ==
In 2010, [[Forbes]] magazine reported that Berlusconi was Italy's third richest man, with a net worth of $9&amp;nbsp;billion. He holds significant assets in television, newspapers, publishing, cinema, finance, banking, insurance, and sport.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_2008&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/10/billionaires-2010_The-Worlds-Billionaires_CountryOfCitizen_13.html | title = Forbes; The World's Billionaires by Country|publisher=[[Forbes]]|date=3 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlusconi's main company, [[Mediaset]], comprises three national television channels covering half of the national television sector; and ''Publitalia'', the leading Italian advertising and publicity agency. Berlusconi also owns a controlling stake in [[Arnoldo Mondadori Editore]], the largest Italian publishing house, whose publications include [[Panorama (Italian magazine)|Panorama]], one of the country's most popular news magazines. His brother, [[Paolo Berlusconi]], owns and operates ''[[il Giornale]]'', a centre-right wing newspaper which provides a pro-Berlusconi slant on Italian politics. ''[[Il Foglio]]'', one of the most influential Italian right-wing newspapers, is partially owned by his wife, [[Veronica Lario]]. After Lario sold some of her ownership in 2010, Paolo Berlusconi acquired a majority interest in the newspaper. Berlusconi is also the founder and major [[shareholder]] of [[Fininvest]], which is among the largest private companies in Italy&lt;ref name=mbres&gt;http://www.mbres.it/sites/default/files/resources/download_it/ps_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and operates in media and finance. With [[Ennio Doris]] he founded [[Mediolanum (company)|Mediolanum]], one of the country's biggest banking and insurance groups. He has interests in cinema and home video distribution (Medusa Film and Penta Film). He is also the owner of the football club [[A.C. Milan]] which along with [[Boca Juniors]] has won the most [[List of confederation and inter-confederation club competition winners#World ranking for official international club titles|FIFA recognized international club titles in the world]].

'''The People of Freedom''' ({{lang-it|Il Popolo della Libertà}}, PdL) is a [[centre-right]] [[list of political parties in Italy|political party in Italy]]. With the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]], it is one of the two major parties of the current Italian party system.

The party was launched by [[Silvio Berlusconi]] on 18 November 2007 and officially founded in a party congress on 27–29 March 2009, when [[Forza Italia]] and [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] were merged together. Apart from Berlusconi, the PdL is led by a secretary, [[Angelino Alfano]], and three coordinators, [[Sandro Bondi]], [[Ignazio La Russa]] and [[Denis Verdini]]. Its leading members include [[Giulio Tremonti]], [[Roberto Formigoni]], [[Franco Frattini]], [[Maurizio Sacconi]], [[Gianni Alemanno]], [[Mariastella Gelmini]] and [[Giancarlo Galan]].

In coalition with [[Lega Nord]], the party formed [[Berlusconi IV Cabinet|Italy's government]] from May 2008 to November 2011.

==History==
===Background===
Following the run-up to the [[Italian general election, 2006|2006 general election]] there had been talk among the component parties of the [[House of Freedoms]] regarding a possible merger into a &quot;united party of moderates and reformers&quot;. [[Forza Italia]] (FI), [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] (AN) and the [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]] (UDC) all seemed interested in the project. Soon after the election, however, UDC leader [[Pier Ferdinando Casini]], who had already been a reluctant coalition partner, started to distance his party from its historical allies. Another party of the coalition, [[Lega Nord]], showed no interest in the idea, because of its character of regional party.

On 2 December 2006, during a big rally of the centre-right in [[Rome]] against [[Prodi II Cabinet|Romano Prodi's government]], [[Silvio Berlusconi]] proposed the foundation of a &quot;freedom party&quot;, stressing that voters of the different parties were all part of a single &quot;people of freedom&quot;. On 21 August 2007 [[Michela Vittoria Brambilla]], president of the [[Circle of Freedom|Circles of Freedom]] (a group of Berlusconi's supporters), registered the name and symbol of the &quot;Freedom Party&quot; (''Partito della Libertà'') on Berlusconi's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americaoggi.info/node/635&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, none of Berlusconi's allies seemed keen on joining such a party, and also some leading members of Forza Italia looked disappointed.

===The &quot;running board revolution&quot;===
On 18 November 2007 Silvio Berlusconi claimed that his supporters had collected over 7 million signatures on an appeal demanding the [[President of the Italian Republic|President of the Republic]], [[Giorgio Napolitano]], to call a fresh election. Shortly afterwards, from the [[running board]] of a car in a crowded Piazza San Babila in [[Milan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=RCS Corriere della Sera |url=http://www.corriere.it/english/articoli/2008/01_Gennaio/02/casta.shtml |title=Corriere.it |publisher=Corriere.it |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; he announced that Forza Italia would soon merge or transform into a new &quot;party of the Italian people&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.skylife.it/html/skylife/tg24/politica.html?idvideo=56053&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/politica/07_novembre_18/berlusconi_partito_popolo_italiano.shtml |title=«Oggi nasce il partito del popolo italiano». Corriere della Sera |publisher=Corriere.it |date=2007-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new course was thus called the &quot;running board revolution&quot; (''rivoluzione del predellino'') and this expression soon became very popular both among Berlusconi's supporters and his adversaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tempi.it/editoriale/002715-il-futuro-della-rivoluzione-del-predellino |title=Il futuro della rivoluzione del predellino &amp;#124; Tempi |publisher=Tempi.it |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2007/12/16/per-la-rivoluzione-del-predellino-il.html |title=E per la rivoluzione del predellino il Cavaliere lascia giacca e cravatta - Repubblica.it » Ricerca |publisher=Ricerca.repubblica.it |date=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning, the fate of Forza Italia remained unclear. Later, it was explained that the new party's core would consist of Forza Italia, the Circles of Freedom and other grassroots groups, and that some minor parties of the House of Freedoms would join too. AN leader [[Gianfranco Fini]] made very critical statements in the days after Berlusconi's announcement, declaring the end of his support for Berlusconi as candidate for Prime Minister and that his party would not join the new party. UDC leader Casini too criticized the idea from the start and seemed interested in an alternative coalition with Fini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2007/novembre/24/Basta_con_populismo_Affondo_Fini_co_9_071124006.shtml |title=«Basta con il populismo» Affondo di Fini e Casini |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2007-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2007/dicembre/10/Fini_Vassallum_Truffa_ira_Forza_co_9_071210045.shtml |title=Fini: il Vassallum? Truffa L' ira di Forza Italia |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2007-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation and early years===
On 24 January 2008 the [[Prodi II Cabinet]] fell, paving the way for a [[Italian general election, 2008|new general election]]. On the day after Berlusconi hinted that Forza Italia would probably contest its last election, and postponed the birth of the new party until after the election. In an atmosphere of reconciliation with Fini, Berlusconi also stated that the new party could see the participation of other parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2008/gennaio/26/Berlusconi_altri_anni_Faro_staffetta_co_9_080126025.shtml |title=Berlusconi: altri 5 anni? Farò staffetta come Blair |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 February, Berlusconi and Fini agreed to form a joint list under the banner of &quot;The People of Freedom&quot;, in alliance with Lega Nord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2008/febbraio/09/Berlusconi_unite_ultimatum_all_Udc_co_9_080209017.shtml |title=Berlusconi: FI e An unite E dà l' ultimatum all' Udc |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2008-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several parties and groups chose to join the PdL: [[Forza Italia]], [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]], the [[Circle of Freedom|Circles of Freedom]], the [[Circles of Good Government]], the [[Liberal Populars]] (a splinter group from the UDC), [[Christian Democracy for Autonomies]], the [[Pensioners' Party (Italy)|Pensioners' Party]], [[Liberal Reformers]], the [[Italian Republican Party]], the [[New Italian Socialist Party]], the [[Liberal Democrats (Italy)|Liberal Democrats]], [[Decide!]], [[Italians in the World]], [[Social Action]] and the [[Reformist Socialists]].

In the [[Italian general election, 2008|general election]] the PdL won 37.4% of the vote, getting elected 276 [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|deputies]] and 146 [[Italian Senate|senators]] and becoming the Italian largest party. The PdL was also the first party since [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] in [[Italian general election, 1979|1979]] to get more than 35% of the popular vote.

On 27–29 March 2009, the new party held its first congress in [[Rome]] and was officially founded. Berlusconi was elected president of the party. [[Sandro Bondi]], [[Ignazio La Russa]] and [[Denis Verdini]] were appointed national coordinators. In the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Italy)|2009 European Parliament election]] the party won 35.2% of the national vote, returning 29 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europe-politique.eu/parlement-europeen-2009.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Italian regional elections, 2010|big round of regional elections of 2010]] the PdL retained [[Lombardy]] with [[Roberto Formigoni]], gained [[Lazio]] with [[Renata Polverini]], [[Campania]] with [[Stefano Caldoro]] and [[Calabria]] with [[Giuseppe Scopelliti]], while [[Veneto]] was won by [[Luca Zaia]] of [[Lega Nord]], which largely passed the PdL there.

===Berlusconi vs. Fini===
{{See also|Generation Italy|Future and Freedom}}

Between 2009 and 2010 [[Gianfranco Fini]], former leader of the conservative National Alliance (AN) and President of the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies]], became a vocal critic of the leadership of Berlusconi. Fini departed from party's majority line on [[stem cell|stem cell research]], [[End-of-life care|end of life]] issues, [[advance health care directive]] and [[immigration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/febbraio/21/Fini_candidato_ideale_Gelo_Russa_co_9_090221015.shtml |title=«Fini, candidato ideale pd» Gelo di La Russa e Gasparri |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/maggio/19/Affondo_Fini_leggi_orientate_dalla_co_9_090519042.shtml |title=Affondo di Fini: no a leggi orientate dalla fede |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/settembre/13/Fini_nuovo_duello_con_Senatur_co_8_090913007.shtml |title=Fini, nuovo duello con il Senatur «Il vero suicidio è negare i diritti» |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2009-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, most of all, he was a proponent of a more structured party organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/settembre/19/Berlusconi_Fini_faccia_faccia_dopo_co_9_090919013.shtml |title=Berlusconi-Fini Un faccia a faccia dopo lo scontro |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/settembre/20/Dubbi_nella_maggioranza_sullo_stop_co_9_090920008.shtml |title=Dubbi nella maggioranza sullo stop alla par condicio |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; His criticism was aimed at the leadership style of Berlusconi, who tends to rely on his personal charisma to lead the party from the centre and supports a lighter form of party, which in his mind should be a movement-party that organises itself only at election times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/settembre/16/premier_consegna_prime_case_Poi_co_8_090916015.shtml |title=Il premier consegna le prime case Poi l' attacco in tv |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some ''Finiani'', such as [[Italo Bocchino]], [[Carmelo Briguglio]] and [[Fabio Granata]], shared Fini's views on moral issues and immigration, many others, including [[Andrea Ronchi]] and [[Adolfo Urso]], took a very different approach on these issues. In fact most ''Finiani'' were [[Southern Italy|Southern]] conservatives who opposed Berlusconi's leadership, his firm alliance with [[Lega Nord]], federal reform and [[Giulio Tremonti]]'s economic policy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilpredellino.it/online/component/content/article/78-articoli/2370-viaggio-tra-i-finiani&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iss.it/binary/sibi/cont/libero2242010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilgiornale.it/interni/fini_e_quellossessione_nord/23-04-2010/articolo-id=439824-page=0-comments=1&lt;/ref&gt; Fini was able to make inroads among the liberal and centrist ranks of the former Forza Italia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/settembre/12/Nel_suo_fortino_Secolo_Con_co_9_090912019.shtml |title=Nel suo «fortino» al Secolo «Con lui, è un leader europeo» |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2009-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he lost the support of most leading members of the former AN, notably including [[Ignazio La Russa]], [[Maurizio Gasparri]] and [[Altero Matteoli]], who became close allies of Berlusconi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/settembre/09/gelo_degli_colonnelli_sul_leader_co_8_090909014.shtml |title=Il gelo degli «ex» colonnelli sul leader |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2009-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/dicembre/04/colonnelli_gelo_con_leader_Alemanno_co_9_091204021.shtml |title=I «colonnelli» e il gelo con l' ex leader Alemanno e Matteoli lontani Gasparri: è cambiato lui, non io |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2009-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, including [[Gianni Alemanno]] and [[Alfredo Mantovano]], found common ground with the party's Christian democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/marzo/30/Fine_vita_Bondi_apre_laici_co_9_090330010.shtml |title=Fine vita, Bondi apre. E i laici: ora si cambi la legge |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 April 2010 Bocchino launched an association named [[Generation Italy]] in order to better represent Fini's views within the party and push for a different party organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/marzo/15/Via_Generazione_Italia_nuova_associazione_co_9_100315008.shtml |title=Via a Generazione Italia la nuova associazione «benedetta» da Fini |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2010-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later 52 MPs (39 deputies and 13 senators) signed a document in support of Fini and his theses, while other 74 MPs former members of AN, including La Russa, Gasparri, Matteoli and [[Giorgia Meloni]], plus Alemanno, Mayor of Rome, signed an alternative document in which they reasserted their loyalty to the party and Berlusconi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/politica/201004articoli/54276girata.asp |title=Pdl, Fini forma la sua corrente &quot;Berlusconi accetti il dissenso&quot; |publisher=Lastampa.It |date=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/politica/201004articoli/54265girata.asp |title=E nasce un Correntone ex An contro Gianfranco |publisher=Lastampa.It |date=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 April 2010 the National Committee of the PdL convened in Rome for the first time in a year. The conflict between Fini and Berlusconi was covered live by television. At the end of the day a resolution proposed by Berlusconi's loyalists was put before the assembly and approved by a landslide margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/aprile/23/sfida_del_cofondatore_Non_sono_co_8_100423002.shtml |title=La sfida del cofondatore «Non sono un dipendente Sarà lui a bruciarsi» |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, clashes between Fini and Berlusconi became even more frequent and reached their height in late July, when Fini questioned the morality of some party bigwigs under investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/interni/fini_chi_e_indagato_lasci_lincarico_le_leggi_non_servano_salvare_furbi/politica-pdl-berlusconi-fini-giustizia-granata-legalita-probiviri-dell_utri-cosentino-verdini/26-07-2010/articolo-id=463524-page=0-comments=1 |title=Fini: &quot;Chi è indagato lasci l'incarico Le leggi non servano a salvare i furbi&quot; - Interni - ilGiornale.it del 26-07-2010 |publisher=Ilgiornale.it |date=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 July 2010 the party executive released a document (voted by 33 members out of 37) in which Fini was described as &quot;incompatible&quot; with the political line of the PdL and unable to perform his job of President of the Chamber of Deputies in a neutral way. Berlusconi asked Fini to step down and the executive proposed the suspension from party membership of three ''Finiani'' (Bocchino, Briguglio and Granata) who had harshly criticized Berlusconi and accused some party members of criminal offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2010/07/29/news/pdl_il_documento_dell_ufficio_di_presidenza-5938625/?ref=HREA-1 |title=Pdl, il documento dell'Ufficio di Presidenza |publisher=Repubblica.it |date=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; As response, Fini and his followers formed their own groups in both chambers under the name of [[Future and Freedom]] (FLI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/luglio/31/Via_gruppi_finiani_Qualche_difficolta_co_8_100731003.shtml |title=Via ai gruppi finiani «Qualche difficoltà ma numeri importanti» |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2010-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/agosto/01/Previsioni_sbagliate_sui_numeri_nel_co_8_100801004.shtml |title=Previsioni sbagliate sui numeri: nel mirino le fedelissime |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/agosto/02/Finiani_pronto_gruppo_anche_Senato_co_9_100802014.shtml |title=Finiani, pronto il gruppo anche al Senato |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16743353 |title=Italy's political crisis: A FLI in his ear |publisher=The Economist |date=2010-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was soon clear that FLI would leave the PdL and become an independent party. On 7 November, during a convention in [[Bastia Umbra]], Fini asked Berlusconi to step down from his post of Prime Minister and proposed a new government including also the [[Union of the Centre (2008)|Union of the Centre]] (UdC).&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/novembre/08/Fini_premier_dimetta_noi_lasceremo_co_8_101108064.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, the four FLI members of the government resigned.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/novembre/16/finiani_fuori_dal_governo_Duello_co_9_101116035.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 December FLI voted against Berlusconi in a vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, a vote won by Berlusconi by 314 to 311.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/novembre/17/Dal_Pdl_Fli_andata_ritorno_co_8_101117015.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/dicembre/15/Sfida_Aula_governo_passa_per_co_9_101215011.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

===Re-organisation and discontents===
In May 2011 the party suffered a big blow in local elections. Particularly painful was the loss of [[Milan]], Berlusconi's hometown and party stronghold, where the outgoing PdL mayor [[Letizia Moratti]] was defeated by [[Giuliano Pisapia]], a leftist independent close to [[Nichi Vendola]]'s [[Left Ecology Freedom]] party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/blogs/newsbook/2011/05/italys_municipal_elections | work=The Economist | title=Not-so-sweet home}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this and to crescent fibrillation within party ranks (especially among ''[[Scajoliani]]'' and ex-AN members), [[Angelino Alfano]], the Justice minister, was chosen as national secretary in charge of re-organising and renewing the party.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/giugno/02/Pdl_all_unanimita_Alfano_sara_co_8_110602021.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment of 40-year old Alfano, a former [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrat]] and later leader of Forza Italia in [[Sicily]], was unanimously decided by the party executive. However, Economy minister [[Giulio Tremonti]] expressed his concerns as the nominee &quot;will make us lose votes in the North&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/giugno/03/Tremonti_dubbi_del_premier_sulla_co_9_110603009.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 July the National Council modified the party's constitution and Alfano was elected secretary almost unanimously. In his acceptance speech, Alfano proposed the introduction of primaries.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/luglio/02/Svolta_nel_Pdl_Alfano_segretario_co_9_110702007.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfano led the party through a huge membership drive and, on 1 November, announced that more than one million individuals had joined the party.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/novembre/02/annuncio_Alfano_milione_iscritti__co_8_111102029.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Alfano also drove the party to a Christian-democratic direction.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/ottobre/19/Berlusconi_cattolici_sono_con_noi_co_8_111019015.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The factions which benefited most from the effort were those of [[Roberto Formigoni]] ([[Network Italy]]), [[Ignazio La Russa]] ([[Protagonist Italy]]) and [[Franco Frattini]] (''[[Liberamente]]''). The Christian-democratization of the party and the perceived marginalization of liberals and social democrats led [[Carlo Vizzini]] to leave the party: &quot;It seems to me that the PdL is set to become the Italian section of the [[European People's Party]]. I come from another tradition: I have been secretary of the [[Italian Democratic Socialist Party|PSDI]] and I was one of the founders of the [[Party of European Socialists]]. When I joined Forza Italia there were [[Italian Liberal Party|Liberals]], [[Italian Socialist Party|Socialists]], [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radicals]]. Now everything has changed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/novembre/01/Pdl_chiusa_campagna_per_tesseramento_co_9_111101018.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

In the midst of the [[European sovereign debt crisis]], Vizzini was not alone in leaving the party. On 14 October, following calls by [[Claudio Scajola]] and [[Giuseppe Pisanu]] for a new government,&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/ottobre/07/fronda_Pisanu_Scajola_idea_Berlusconi_co_9_111007015.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/ottobre/10/Scajola_Pdl_sfida_sui_deputati_co_9_111010023.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; two deputies close to Scajola, [[Giustina Destro]] and [[Fabio Gava]], voted against Berlusconi during a vote of confidence and left the party altogether.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/ottobre/15/governo_incassa_fiducia_Fallito_piano_co_9_111015002.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 November, Destro and Gava, along with [[Roberto Antonione]], [[Giorgio Stracquadanio]], [[Isabella Bertolini]] and [[Giancarlo Pittelli]] (who had left the party along with [[Santo Versace]] in September), promoted an open letter in which they asked Berlusconi to step down.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/novembre/03/Servono_una_diversa_fase_politica_co_8_111103018.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/novembre/03/Lettera_dei_ribelli_cosi_non_co_8_111103019.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Contextually, Antonione announced that he was leaving the party.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/novembre/02/Antonione_lascia_gruppo_pdl_Maggioranza_co_8_111102028.shtm&lt;/ref&gt; In the following days three more deputies, [[Alessio Bonciani]], [[Ida D'Ippolito]] and [[Gabriella Carlucci]], left to join the [[Union of the Centre (2008)|Union of the Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/novembre/04/Ribelli_inquieti_due_vanno_all_co_8_111104016.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/novembre/07/Maggioranza_ansia_verso_Aula_per_co_9_111107007.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; In three months, the PdL had lost 15 deputies and 4 senators, including 7 deputies and 3 senators who launched [[Force of the South]]/[[Great South]] under [[Gianfranco Micciché]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.camera.it/217?idGruppo=477&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.senato.it/composizione/21600/159070/152847/genpagina.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berlusconi's resignation===
On 7 November Lega Nord's leader [[Umberto Bossi]] proposed [[Angelino Alfano]] as Berlusconi's successor.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/novembre/08/Bossi_provo_carta_Angelino__co_9_111108002.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 November, during a key vote on a financial statement in the Chamber, three more deputies elected with the PdL ([[Franco Stradella]], [[Gennaro Malgieri]] and [[Francesco Stagno d'Alcontres]] of Great South) were absent or abstained from the vote. The statement was passed thanks to the abstention of opposition parties, but Berlusconi got just 308 votes, 8 short of absolute majority. Malgieri stated that he was in the restroom and that he intended to vote yes, while another centre-right deputy, [[Francesco Nucara]] of the [[Italian Republican Party]], was at the hospital and another one, [[Alfonso Papa]], in jail.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/novembre/09/Berlusconi_giorno_dello_strappo_Lascio_co_8_111109014.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/novembre/09/Montecitorio_ribelli_organizzano_co_8_111109035.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Berlusconi announced that he intended to step down after the passage of the budget bill.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/novembre/09/Napolitano_premier_atti_immediati_Colle_co_9_111109034.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Days of big turmoil followed. Not only the party was highly divided, but its numerous factions and groups were divided too. As the appointment of [[Mario Monti]], an independent economist and former [[European Commission]]er, looked very likely, some in the party wanted to support the new possible government (and some even wanted to join it), while others were resolutely against and preferred an early election instead. Alfano, in his capacity of secretary, had to mediate.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/novembre/11/Pdl_lacerato_Alfano_mediatore_Spunta_co_8_111111006.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the party's Christian democrats, [[Roberto Formigoni]], [[Maurizio Lupi]] and [[Raffaele Fitto]] ([[Network Italy]]), [[Claudio Scajola]] ([[Christopher Columbus Foundation]]), and [[Giuseppe Pisanu]] (hence ''[[Pisaniani]]'') supported Monti, while [[Gianfranco Rotondi]] ([[Christian Democracy for Autonomies]]) and [[Carlo Giovanardi]] ([[Liberal Populars]]) did not. Within ''[[Liberamente]]'' and among the party's [[Italian Socialist Party|Socialists]], [[Franco Frattini]] (who threatened to leave the party) and [[Fabrizio Cicchitto]] were in favour, while [[Mariastella Gelmini]], [[Paolo Romani]], [[Maurizio Sacconi]], [[Renato Brunetta]] and, covertly, [[Giulio Tremonti]] were against. The vast majority of former [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] members ([[Ignazio La Russa]], [[Maurizio Gasparri]], [[Altero Matteoli]], [[Giorgia Meloni]], etc.) was against, while a minority (mainly [[Gianni Alemanno]]) was in favour.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/novembre/09/Montecitorio_ribelli_organizzano_co_8_111109035.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/novembre/09/Dai_vertici_pdl_ultima_spinta_co_8_111109037.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/novembre/10/Pdl_spacca_fronte_dei_contrari_co_8_111110020.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/novembre/10/Cavaliere_chiuda_uomo_Stato_Aiuti_co_8_111110021.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/novembre/11/all_emergenza_Nel_programma_punti_co_9_111111016.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/novembre/11/Abbiamo_litigato_tutto_con_Come_co_9_111111017.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/novembre/12/Pdl_crisi_tra_malumori_sospetti_co_9_111112020.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 November Berlusconi finally tendered his resignation to President [[Giorgio Napolitano]]. The executive of the PdL decided to support a government led by Monti under some conditions, the first being that it should not include politicians but just technocrats.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/novembre/13/Berlusconi_dato_dimissioni_giorno_dell_co_8_111113011.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/novembre/13/leader_esce_scena_Senato_possiamo_co_8_111113028.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/novembre/13/voto_sarebbe_massacro__co_9_111113097.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Monti Cabinet]] took office on 16 November. In the subsequent votes of confidence in the two houses of Parliament, the PdL voted largely for Monti. Anyway, some party members, including [[Antonio Martino]], Gianfranco Rotondi and [[Alessandra Mussolini]], deserted the party.&lt;ref&gt;http://parlamento.openpolis.it/votazione/37585&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://parlamento.openpolis.it/votazione/37584&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, on 16 December, 70 deputies, including Martino, Tremonti, La Russa, Mussolini and Stracquadanio, refused to vote the government's austerity measures, as the rest of the party did.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/dicembre/17/Assenti_astenuti_fuga_tanti_del_co_8_111217015.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Lega Nord broke its ties with the PdL and Bossi announced that Tremonti would join his party soon.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/dicembre/15/deriva_dei_lumbard_rende_piu_co_8_111215019.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unita.it/italia/bossi-tremonti-verra-con-noi-br-basta-silvio-ora-sta-con-comunisti-1.361931&lt;/ref&gt; Alfano and Berlusconi, for their part, were planning to change the party's name and introduce primaries, which would almost certainly see Formigoni run against Alfano.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/novembre/25/Primarie_nuovo_nome_Alfano_ridisegna_co_9_111125039.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, on 15 December, [[Stefania Craxi]], a leading social democrat within the party and leader of the [[Italian Reformists]], left the PdL.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/dicembre/16/deciso_lascio_Pdl_Silvio_comandera_co_9_111216020.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
The PdL aims to combine together the traditions of its two main predecessors, [[Forza Italia]] (FI) and [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] (AN), as well as their smaller partners ([[Liberal Populars]], [[Christian Democracy for Autonomies]], [[New Italian Socialist Party]], [[Liberal Reformers]], [[Social Action]], etc.).

Forza Italia, launched in 1994 by [[Silvio Berlusconi]], was joined mainly by former [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]], [[Italian Socialist Party|Socialists]] and [[Italian Liberal Party|Liberals]] who had seen their parties disappear amid the ''[[Tangentopoli]]'' scandals. National Alliance, successor of the post-[[Italian Fascism|fascist]] [[Italian Social Movement]] (MSI), had become a respectable conservative party under the leadership of [[Gianfranco Fini]]. FI and AN started to cooperate and were the pillars of the centre-right [[Pole of Good Government]], [[Pole of Freedoms]] and [[House of Freedoms]] coalitions.

The &quot;Charter of Values&quot; of the PdL underlines the &quot;Christian&quot; and &quot;liberal&quot; character of the party, presenting it as a defender of traditional values as well as of individual responsibility and self-determination. The document stresses the adherence of the party to the values and the platform of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP), its support for [[European integration]] and the transformation of Italy into a [[federation|federal state]], coherently with its alliance with [[Lega Nord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Movimento Politico il Popolo della Libertà |url=http://www.ilpopolodellaliberta.it/notizie/arc_15346.htm |title=PdL - Il Popolo della Libertà - CARTA DEI VALORI |publisher=Ilpopolodellaliberta.it |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PdL is a classical example of [[big tent|catch-all party]]. Although the leadership of Berlusconi is largely unquestioned, the party is far from being a monolith. In line with its allies within the EPP, its main cultural strains are [[Christian democracy]] and [[liberal conservatism]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Nordsieck&quot; /&gt; but it is not to underestimate the weight of those coming from the right-wing AN and the relevant role played by former Socialists, who were disproportionately represented in [[Berlusconi IV Cabinet]]. Four leading ministers ([[Giulio Tremonti]], [[Franco Frattini]], [[Maurizio Sacconi]] and [[Renato Brunetta]]) hail from the old [[Italian Socialist Party|PSI]], while another Socialist, [[Fabrizio Cicchitto]], is the party leader in the Chamber of Deputies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/settembre/23/Michelis_consulente_Brunetta_padre_che_co_8_090923030.shtml |title=De Michelis consulente di Brunetta «Io, un padre che torna ai figli» |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2009-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2008/novembre/25/SOCIALISMO_BRUNETTA_STORIA_FORZA_ITALIA_co_9_081125066.shtml |title=Il Socialismo Di Brunetta E La Storia Di Forza Italia |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to say that all former Socialists are actually social-democratic now: for instance, while Tremonti is an outspoken critic of [[globalization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2008/marzo/04/Tremonti_denuncio_globalizzazione_co_9_080304123.shtml |title=E Tremonti denunciò la globalizzazione |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2008-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is not enthusiastic about [[labour market flexibility]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/ottobre/20/Tremonti_credo_posto_fisso_non_co_8_091020025.shtml |title=Tremonti: credo al posto fisso, non alla mobilità |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunetta is a free-market liberal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-economist.com/PrinterFriendly.cfm?story_id=12009720&amp;source=login_payBarrier |title=Premium content |publisher=Economist.com |date=2008-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2008/marzo/08/PARADOSSO_TREMONTI_co_9_080308109.shtml |title=Il Paradosso Di Tremonti |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and frequently clashes with Tremonti over economic and fiscal policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/novembre/22/Brunetta_basta_veti_Tremonti_commissariato_co_9_091122017.shtml |title=Brunetta: basta veti Tremonti ha commissariato il governo |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2009-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/novembre/23/Tesoro_disorientato_Telefonata_con_Cavaliere_co_8_091123004.shtml |title=Il Tesoro «disorientato» Telefonata con il Cavaliere |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2009-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, internal alliances are often not consistent with the previous affiliation of party members. On issues such as [[End-of-life care|end of life]], Sacconi, a former Socialist who still claims to be a social democrat, has sided with the party's Christian democrats and the social-conservative wing of the former AN, while several members hailing from the MSI found themselves in alliance with the liberal wing of the former FI. This is no surprise as the late MSI also had a strong [[secularism|secular]] tradition, now represented by Gianfranco Fini, while Forza Italia was home to both social conservatives and uncompromising social liberals. On the economy, ex-FI Giulio Tremonti has often been at odds with ex-FI liberals like [[Antonio Martino]] and [[Benedetto Della Vedova]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2008/maggio/12/solitudine_del_liberale_forzistaNella_raccolta_ce_0_080512024.shtml |title=La solitudine del liberale forzistaNella raccolta di articoli dell' ex ministro Martino la contrapposizione con il colbertismo di Tremonti |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libertiamo.it/2009/03/14/martino-pdl-somiglia-a-fascismo-no-a-liberalismo/ |title=Martino: Pdl somiglia a fascismo, no a liberalismo |publisher=Libertiamo.it |date=2009-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, more recently, he was attacked by [[Giancarlo Galan]] for being a &quot;socialist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilgiornale.it/interni/fermiamo_tremonti_condiziona_governo_e_ci_fara_perdere_voti/21-04-2011/articolo-id=518506-page=0-comments=1&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional values and the [[social market economy]] grew of importance in the rhetoric of the new party, partly replacing the [[small government]] and [[libertarianism|libertarian]] ideals expressed by Forza Italia since 1994. In this respect, Maurizio Sacconi summarised the economic propositions of the PdL with the slogan &quot;less state, more society&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/agosto/02/Contro_noi_cartello_cadiamo_voto_co_9_100802015.shtml |title=«Contro di noi un cartello Se cadiamo si va al voto» |publisher=Corriere della Sera |date=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is still some room for [[Reaganomics]] in the PdL, with Berlusconi often making the case for lower taxes and Tremonti for [[deregulation]] and against [[red tape]].&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/giugno/13/Tremonti_ora_piano_per_liberta_co_8_100613016.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2010/giugno/13/Una_riforma_quattro_mesi_punta_co_8_100613003.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2011/febbraio/02/Quella_telefonata_tra_Cavaliere_Tremonti_co_9_110202059.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factions==
The party is home to a wide range of factions, groups and associate parties, whose ideology range from [[social democracy]] to [[national conservatism]]. As of November 2011, the factions, listed by political ideology, were as follows:
*'''[[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]]'''. The core of the former Forza Italia plus some minor groups ([[Network Italy]], ''[[Scajoliani]]''/[[Christopher Columbus Foundation]], ''[[Pisaniani]]'', [[Christian Democracy for Autonomies]], [[Liberal Populars]], [[Christian Reformists]], [[Federation of Christian Populars]], and a pletora of local groups). Many party members hail from the late [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]]: they include [[Roberto Formigoni]], [[Renato Schifani]], [[Claudio Scajola]], [[Angelino Alfano]], [[Mario Mauro]] and [[Maurizio Lupi]].
*'''[[Liberalism|Liberal]] [[Centrism|centrists]]'''. Various groups which preside the political centre of the party (''[[Liberamente]]'', ''[[Tremontiani]]'', [[Magna Carta (Italy)|Magna Carta]], ''[[Dellutriani]]''). ''Liberamente'', led by [[Mariastella Gelmini]] and [[Franco Frattini]], represents the bulk of Forza Italia, being composed by liberal loyalists of Berlusconi, and is probably the single largest faction within the party.
*'''[[Liberalism|Liberals]]'''. The liberal factions of the former Forza Italia ([[Free Foundation]], [[Popular Liberalism]]) plus some new groupings (mainly [[Countercurrent (PdL faction, Italy)|Countercurrent]]). Leading liberals within PdL ranks are [[Antonio Martino]], [[Raffaele Costa]], [[Giancarlo Galan]] and [[Daniele Capezzone]].
*'''[[Social democracy|Social democrats]]'''. The social democrats of the former Forza Italia, their organisations ([[Reformism and Freedom]], [[We Reformers]], [[Italian Reformists]], [[European Reformists]]), plus the [[New Italian Socialist Party]]. Notably, several leading members of the party started their political career in the [[Italian Socialist Party]] and some of them still identify themselves as Socialists: Franco Frattini, [[Giulio Tremonti]], [[Maurizio Sacconi]], [[Renato Brunetta]], [[Fabrizio Cicchitto]] and [[Stefano Caldoro]].
*'''[[Liberal conservatism|Liberal conservatives]]'''. The bulk of former National Alliance's main factions ([[New Alliance (Italy)|New Alliance]], [[Protagonist Right]]), as well as some people from other parties; [[Maurizio Gasparri]] and [[Ignazio La Russa]] have re-organised their faction into as [[Protagonist Italy]], while [[Altero Matteoli]] launched the [[Foundation of Freedom]].
*'''[[National conservatism|National conservatives]]'''. The right-wing of the former National Alliance represented by several groups ([[New Italy (faction)|New Italy]], [[Movement for Italy]], [[Libertarian Right]]).
*'''[[Grassroots]]'''. Centre-right clubs in the Forza Italia tradition ([[Promoters of Freedom]], [[Circle of Freedom|Circles of Freedom]], [[Clubs of Freedom]], [[Circles of Good Government]]).

==Popular support==
The People of Freedom has its strongholds in [[Northern Italy]], and especially [[Lombardy]] and [[Veneto]], and in some regions of the [[Southern Italy|South]], notably including [[Sicily]] and [[Apulia]]. Despite this, at the [[Italian general election, 2008|2008 general election]], the party was fairly stronger in the South than in the North, due to the big win of [[Lega Nord]], which gained 27.1% in Veneto, 21.6% in Lombardy and 12.6% in [[Piedmont]]. In this respect the region where PdL scored best was [[Campania]], with a surprising 49.1% in a traditionally [[centre-left]] region. At the [[Italian regional elections, 2010|2010 regional elections]] Lega Nord passed the PdL in Veneto (35.2%) and in large chuncks of Lombardy, which was however the region in which the PdL scored best.

The electoral results of the PdL in the [[Ranked lists of Italian regions|10 most populated Regions of Italy]] are shown in the table below. As the party was launched in 2007, the electoral results from 1994 to 2006 refer to the combined result of the two main percursor parties, [[Forza Italia]] and [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]].

The '''University of Milan''' ({{lang-it|Università degli Studi di Milano}}, &quot;'''Statale'''&quot;) is a [[higher education]] institution in [[Milan]], [[Italy]]. It is one of the largest [[university|universities]] in [[Europe]], with about 62,801 [[student]]s, a teaching and research staff of 2,455 and a non-teaching staff of 2,200.

The university is a member of the [[League of European Research Universities]].

The University offers 9 Faculties, 134 study courses (divided between 1st and 2nd level degree programes), 19 Doctoral Schools and 92 Specialization Schools. The 2,500 professors represent the highest concentration of scientific expertise in the region and the University's research is ranked among the best in Italy and Europe.

The University of Milan has broadened its area of activity over the years to meet the needs of a rapidly developing society. As a consequence the number of Faculties has been increased including Agriculture, Pharmacy, Veterinary Medicine, Political Sciences and Exercise Sciences.

The University's research and teaching activities have developed over the years and have received important international recognitions. The University is the only Italian member of the League of European Research Universities (LERU), a prestigious group of twenty-two research-intensive European Universities. It has also been awarded the following ranking positions:
-1st in Italy and 7th in Europe (The Leiden Ranking - Universiteit Leiden)
-1st in Italy, between 35th and 56th in Europe, between 101st and 150th in the world (Academic Ranking of World Universities - Shangai Jiao Tong University)
-1st in Italy, 16th in Europe and 74th in the world (Council of Taiwan).

Located in one of the most industrialized geographical areas in Europe, the University of Milan operates in a strongly business-oriented environment covering both domestic and foreign markets and where the progress of knowledge goes hand-in-hand with the transfer of results to the industry world. This constitutes a priority for a university playing, with its broad range of expertise, a decisive role in increasing the competitiveness of enterprises through the processes of innovation which generate wide-ranging economic and social benefits at international level.

Throughout [[Milan]], the University is commonly nicknamed and referred to as ''Statale'' (eng. State) to avoid confusion with other private universities in the city, such as the Business University Luigi [[Bocconi]], the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart ([[Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore]]) and the Free University of Languages and Communication ([[IULM]]).



==History==
[[Image:Festa del Perdono Facciata Milano.jpg|270px|thumb|left|Via Festa del Perdono, ancient seat of the &quot;Ospedal Maggiore&quot; (Greater Hospital), now seat of the University of Milan]]

===The Birth===
The University of Milan was founded in 1924, uniting two institutions that boasted a great tradition of medical, scientific and humanistic studies: the Accademia Scientifico-Letteraria (Scientific-Literary Academy), active since 1861, and the Istituti Clinici di Perfezionamento (Clinical Specialisation Institutes), established in 1906.
By 1928, the University already had the fourth-highest number of enrolled students in Italy, after Naples, Rome and Padua, distinguishing itself through the high profile of its teaching staff.
Its premises are located in Città Studi (the City of Studies), the university quarter constructed from 1915 onwards that is home to the scientific faculties, and in several buildings in the historic city centre, which house the humanities faculties.
At the time of its foundation, there were four “traditional” faculties  - Law, Humanities, Medicine and Mathematical, Physical and Natural Sciences; then, in the 1930s, the Faculties of Veterinary Medicine and Agriculture were introduced, after the aggregation of the old schools of Veterinary Medicine (1792) and Agriculture (1871).
At the end of the Second World War, the old Ospedale dei Poveri (Hospital for the Poor), known as “la Cà Granda” (the Big House), was assigned to the University. The building, one of the first Italian examples of civil architecture -  commissioned in the 15th century by the Sforza family, the dukes of Milan - was seriously damaged by the bombings of 1943. In 1958, after a complex series of reconstruction and renovation works, it became home to the University Rector’s Office, the administrative offices and the Faculties of Law and Humanities.
 
===The 1960s Reformation===
In the 1960s, due to the extension of compulsory school attendance and the subsequent liberalisation of access to university education, the number of people entering Italian universities progressively increased and the University of Milan enrolled more than 60,000 students.
The University added to its range of courses and at the same time increased its number of centres. Two new faculties were established, Pharmacy and Social and Political Sciences, which were based, respectively, in Città Studi and in Via Conservatorio, in the centre of Milan.
Città Studi was also the site of a new complex, intended entirely for the biology departments, which was the work of architect Vico Magistretti, one of the fathers of Italian design.
There was also an increase in the number of agreements with the city’s hospital facilities, where students from the Faculty of Medicine receive their clinical training.
In 1968, the University occupied approximately 127 thousand square metres; by the beginning of the 1980s this had increased to 205 thousand square metres. In 1989 there were 22 degree courses and 75 thousand enrolled students, a number which would rise to 90 thousand by 1993.
 
===The 1980s Streamline Process===
In view of this increase, the University began a process of streamlining and delocalising its facilities: from 1986 onwards, new centres began to appear in other areas of Milan, particularly in the Bicocca district, as well as in other parts of the region, in Como, Varese, Crema and Lodi.
In 1998, the University split in two and the city’s second public institution was founded: The University of Milan-Bicocca. The University of Insubria was also established in Varese, bringing together courses that were already offered at Varese and Como by the Universities of Milan and Pavia.
At the conclusion of this process, notwithstanding the reduction in the number of students, the University of Milan was still the largest institution in the Lombardy region and still one of the largest in the country.
The 2001 law that transformed the education system opened a new phase of change. The University updated its range of courses, adapting them to better suit the evolution of the social demand for education and the innovation of the production system: thus, the number of degree courses rose to 74 and there was a new increase in enrolments.
There was also an increase in the University’s commitment to providing student services (orientation, internships and training, online education) and in investments for new education and research facilities (covering approximately 80 thousand square metres).
The most recent phase of expansion concerned the fields of communication science, intercultural mediation and art, but there are also ongoing projects relating to the sectors of information technology, veterinary medicine and biomedicine.
Furthermore, there was also a strengthening of commitment to technology transfer and the practical application of scientific research results in the economic-production context.
 
===The Present===
At the present time, the University offers 9 faculties, 134 study courses (divided between 1st and 2nd level degree programmes), 19 doctoral schools (scuole di dottorato) and 92 specialisation schools (scuole di specializzazione).
Approximately 65,000 students are enrolled at the University. The teaching staff is composed of 2,500 tenured professors and researchers and approximately 500 adjunct professors.
More than 2,300 people work in the technical and administrative sector.
The University of Milan was one of the institutions that helped to found LERU, the League of European Research Universities, and is the only Italian University to be a member of the organisation.
Thanks to its commitment to basic and applied research, the University is among the top institutions in the main national and international rankings.


==The University==

The University of Milan is a public teaching and research university, which - with 9 faculties and a teaching staff of 2,196  professors - is distinguished by its wide variety of disciplinary fields.
A leading institute in Italy and Europe for scientific productivity, the University of Milan is the largest university in the region, with approximately 65,000 students; it is also an important resource for the socio-economic context of which it is a part.
Milan is, in fact, the capital of Lombardy, one of the most dynamic and international regions in the European Union, a leader in the national economy that stands at the Italian forefront of research and development investments and commitment to technological innovation.
The University of Milan also possesses a remarkable artistic and cultural heritage that includes important historic buildings, inherited and acquired collections, archives, botanical gardens and the old Brera Observatory commissioned by Maria Teresa of Austria.
The University’s departments are housed in important historic edifices in the centre of Milan and in modern buildings in the area known as Città Studi (the City of Studies).
Among the palazzos that house the University’s facilities are the old “Ca’ Granda” (&quot;the big house&quot;) – a monumental complex from the 15th-century in the heart of the historical city centre - the 18th-century Palazzo Greppi designed by Giuseppe Piermarini – who built the Scala Theatre in Milan – and the 17th-century Sant’Alessandro College commissioned by the Arcimboldi family.
The book collection, which is one of the richest in the region, is preserved in 87 libraries, while the APICE Centre collects rare and valuable book stocks and archives.
The University also has a Choir and its own Orchestra, which actively contributes to the cultural life of the city and receives international acknowledgements on an increasingly frequent basis.

'''Veronica Lario''' (born on 19 July 1956 as '''Miriam Raffaella Bartolini'''){{cn|date=November 2011}} is a former [[Italian people|Italian]] actress, ex wife of former [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]] [[Silvio Berlusconi]], although she has filed for legal separation, which is the first step towards divorce in Italian law.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8031520.stm | work=BBC News | title=Berlusconi's wife to divorce him | date=3 May 2009 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[Bologna]], Lario was an [[actress]] in [[low budget films]]. She also worked in theatrical plays with well-known actors; she retired from acting after meeting Silvio Berlusconi. 

Married on 15 December 1990, Berlusconi and Lario have three children together: Barbara (1984),&lt;ref name=prevMarriage&gt;At this time Silvio Berlusconi was still married to Carla Elvira Lucia Dall'Oglio, from whom he was divorced in 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Eleonora (1986), and Luigi (1988). In the 80s, before the birth of the first-born daughter Barbara, Lario terminated an earlier [[pregnancy]] with an [[induced abortion]], in order not to give birth to a child affected by significant [[morbidity]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Politica/2005/04_Aprile/08/veronica.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

As the wife of the Italian premier, Veronica Lario has chosen to maintain a low public profile. She has avoided most public events and meetings and she seldom accompanies her husband Silvio Berlusconi at official meetings. On the other hand, she has been known to have publicly expressed political opinions contrasting with those of her husband (for example, on [[bioethics]] or in backing for protesters demonstrating against the war in Iraq&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8031520.stm |title=BBC NEWS &amp;#124; Europe &amp;#124; Berlusconi's wife to divorce him |format= |work= BBC News|accessdate=2009-12-16 | date=3 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Lario's husband was never shy about mentioning her on public occasions, and he has alluded at least once to a supposed affair between her and opposition politician [[Massimo Cacciari]].&lt;ref name=allegedAffair&gt;While the supposed affair was only mentioned in gossip tabloids, on October 2002, during a press conference with [[Denmark|Danish]] prime minister [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]], Silvio Berlusconi said he ought to introduce his wife to Rasmussen, &quot;the best-looking prime minister in Europe and certainly more handsome than Cacciari&quot;. See also [http://www.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,,1005001,00.html the Guardian] on this episode.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 January 2007, Lario said her dignity had been damaged by comments Berlusconi reportedly made during the VIP party after a TV awards ceremony broadcast by one of his channels.

&quot;If I weren't married I would marry you immediately&quot;, the 70-year-old media mogul told showgirl and future parliamentarian [[Mara Carfagna]], according to reports widely carried in the Italian press. He reportedly told another, &quot;With you, I'd go anywhere&quot;.

Lario's letter appeared in ''[[La Repubblica]]'', a left-leaning newspaper fiercely opposed to the conservative Berlusconi. She declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I see these statements as damaging my dignity. To both my husband and the public man, I therefore demand a public apology, since I haven't received any privately. I have faced the inevitable contrasts and the more painful moments that a long conjugal relation entails with respect and discretion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&quot;Now I write to state my reaction,&quot; added Lario, saying her husband's comments were &quot;unacceptable&quot; and could not be reduced to mere jokes.

But after few hours, Silvio Berlusconi wrote back a public letter to his wife and apologized for what he had said three days before.

In April 2009 she once more published an open letter, criticising her husband for consorting with young ladies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/30/world/europe/30italy.html | work=The New York Times | title=Premier's Roving Eye Enrages Wife, but Not His Public | first=Rachel | last=Donadio | date=30 April 2009 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and defining his chosen candidates for the European Parliament as &quot;shameless rubbish&quot;.

On 3 May 2009 it was reported that she is to file for divorce,&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/05/03/italy.berlusconi.divorce/index.html | work=CNN | title=Berlusconi's wife wants to end marriage, reports say - CNN.com | accessdate=27 May 2010 | date=3 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which under Italian law can only be started after a couple has reached a separation agreement. On 10 May 2010 it was revealed that a separation settlement had been reached, with Berlusconi accepting alimony payments of €3.5 million per year, and allowing her to live in their luxury home near Milan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/berlusconis-wife-to-accept-836435m-a-year-in-divorce-2173887.html | work=Irish Independent | first=Paul | last=Verenz | title=Berlusconi's wife to accept €3.5m a year in divorce | date=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was christened '''Theresa Cara Booth'''. &lt;!-- per her memoir, Speaking for Myself: the Autobiography by Cherie Blair  --&gt; Her father, British actor [[Antony Booth|Tony Booth]], left her mother, actress Gale Howard (née Joyce Smith), &lt;!-- Mother's real name also per memoir --&gt; when Cherie was eight years old. She and her younger sister, Lyndsey, were then brought up by their mother Gale and their paternal grandmother, Vera Booth, a devout [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] of Irish descent. The sisters attended Catholic schools in [[Crosby, Merseyside|Crosby]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton|Sefton]]. Cherie Booth attended [[Seafield Convent Grammar]] which is now part of [[Sacred Heart Catholic College]], where she achieved 4 Grade A GCE [[Advanced Level (UK)|A Level]] passes.

==University, marriage, family==
[[File:Cherie and Euan Blair -Red Bull Air Race -London -28July2007 (2).jpg|left|thumb|Euan (left) and Cherie Blair at the [[Red Bull Air Race World Championship|Red Bull Air Race 2007]], London]]
She studied law at the [[London School of Economics]] and graduated with [[First Class Honours (degree)|First Class Honours]]. She later came at the top of her year in the bar exams,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2053193.stm &quot;Profile: Cherie Blair&quot;], BBC, 19 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt; while teaching law at the [[University of Westminster|Polytechnic of Central London]] (University of Westminster). In 1976, while she was studying to become a barrister, she met future Prime Minister and husband Tony Blair. She obtained a [[pupillage]] in the chambers of [[Derry Irvine, Baron Irvine of Lairg|Derry Irvine]] ahead of him, although he was also taken on. Married on 29 March 1980, they have four children: Euan, Nicholas, Kathryn, and Leo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/05/10/blair.facts/index.html CNN.com] Facts: Life and times of Tony Blair&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/822238.stm | work=BBC News | title=Blair's son 'drunk and incapable' | date=6 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leo was the first child born to a serving Prime Minister in over 150 years, since Francis Russell was born to Lord John Russell on 11 July 1849.

In July 1999 she was awarded an Honorary Degree from the Open University as Doctor of the University.

==Political attempt and views==
Cherie Blair unsuccessfully contested the seat of [[North Thanet (UK Parliament constituency)|North Thanet]] in [[Kent]] for [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 UK general election]], losing to [[Roger Gale]] ([[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/gordon-brown/6183615/Cherie-Blair-plans-to-be-Gordon-Browns-secret-weapon-at-the-election.html], 'Cherie Blair plans to be Gordon Brown's secret weapon at the election'&lt;/ref&gt; 

She has described herself as a [[socialist]] and at times has appeared to have views further to the [[left-wing politics|left]] than those of her husband.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/may/17/cherieblair.politicalbooks], 'Yes, I am a socialist,' Guardian, 17 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008 she chaired the Street Weapons Commission on behalf of the broadcaster [[Channel 4]]. Booth and her team toured the UK and took evidence from people affected by street crime and published a report and practical advice in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/mar/26/channel4.television1 Cherie tackles street crime with Channel 4] Guardian, 26 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal career==
A member of [[Lincoln's Inn]], she became a [[barrister]] in 1976 and [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1995. Until 1988, her head of chambers was [[George Carman]] QC. In 1999, she was appointed a [[recorder (judge)|Recorder]] (a permanent part-time judge) in the [[County Court]] and [[Crown Court]]. She was Chancellor of [[Liverpool John Moores University]] from 1999–2006, and on 26 July 2006 was awarded the honorary title of Emeritus Chancellor. She is also Governor of the London School of Economics and the [[Open University]]. She is a founding member of [[Matrix Chambers]] in London from which she continues to practise as a barrister. Matrix was formed in 2000 specialising in [[human rights law]], though members also practise in a range of areas of UK [[Public law|public]] and [[private law]], the [[Law of the European Union]] and [[European Convention on Human Rights]], and [[public international law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matrixlaw.co.uk/AreasOfPractice.aspx &quot;Areas Of Practice&quot;], Matrix Chambers&lt;/ref&gt;

She specialises in [[Labour law|employment]], discrimination and public law and in this capacity has occasionally represented claimants taking cases against the UK government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2003/445.html &quot;Purja and Ors v Ministry of Defence&quot;], British and Irish Legal Information Institute, 21 February 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Cherie Blair has appeared in a number of leading cases.

== Controversies ==
In 2002, Blair purchased two flats in [[Bristol]] with the assistance, it was alleged but later denied, of [[Peter Foster]], a convicted Australian [[Confidence trick|conman]] and boyfriend of Blair's friend Carole Caplin, who negotiated a discount for Blair.&lt;ref name=BBCsorry&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2563649.stm &quot;Cherie says 'sorry' for Foster dealings&quot;], BBC, 10 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Blair publicly apologised for her embarrassing connection to Foster, stating, &quot;I did not think it was my business to choose my friends' friends&quot;.&lt;ref name=BBCsorry /&gt;

Her relationship with [[Carole Caplin]] has given rise to headlines in some newspapers, as Caplin is credited with introducing Blair to various [[New Age]] symbols and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,6903,856064,00.html &quot;Ev'rybody must get stones&quot;], The Observer, 8 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Reports of Blair's New Age practices included an account of her 2001 holiday in Mexico, when she and her husband, wearing only swimming costumes, privately took part in a rebirthing procedure that involved smearing mud and fruit over each others' bodies while sitting in a steam bath.&lt;ref name=mumbojumbo&gt;''How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered the World'', [[Francis Wheen]], Harper Perennial 2004, ISBN 0-00-714097-5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, she apologized after saying within hours of a [[Jerusalem]] blast that killed at least 19 people in reference to the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[Suicide attack|suicide bomber]]s: &quot;As long as young people feel they have no hope but to blow themselves up, we're never going to make progress, are we?&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/cherie/story/0,12713,1409010,00.html Cherie under attack: from fur in flight to freebies]&quot;, The Guardian, 9 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2051372.stm PM's wife 'sorry' in suicide bomb row]&quot;, BBC News, 18 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ConnaughtSquareStreetSign.jpg|thumb|'''Connaught Square''', Westminster — predominantly four storey town houses surround a private gated [[communal garden]] planted with mature trees.]]

'''Connaught Square''', in the [[City of Westminster]] (a [[London Borough]]), was the first square of city houses to be built in the [[Bayswater]] area. It was named after the [[Duke of Gloucester]] (who was also the Earl of [[Connacht|Connaught]]), who had a house nearby. The current appearance of the square dates from the 1820s. The square is just north of Hyde Park, and to the west of [[Edgware Road (London)|Edgware Road]]. It is also within 300m of [[Marble Arch]], and the western end of [[Oxford Street]].

It is suggested&lt;ref&gt;&quot;London: The Biography&quot; by Peter Ackroyd (Vintage 2001) ISBN 0099422581&lt;/ref&gt; that the notorious gallows, Tyburn Tree, the site of public execution in London, were located within the square.

==Architecture==
Connaught Square's architecture is primarily [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]]. Redevelopment was initially planned in the early 18th century and the first of its 45 brick houses was built in 1828 as part of the Hyde Park estate by [[Thomas Allason]].

==Community==
Residents of Connaught Square hold an exclusive summer party in the central [[communal garden]] every year. The [[garden square]] is maintained by the owners of the adjoining properties who contribute to its upkeep, and in return are issued keys to the garden. Such gated gardens are a particular feature of this area of London. The horses of the [[Royal Artillery]] regularly do their early morning rides down Connaught Street.

==Blair's residence==
In October 2004, the then [[Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] and his wife [[Cherie Blair|Cherie]] purchased a house on the West side of Connaught Square, for a reported £3.5million.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3707520.stm The house that Tony bought]'', [[BBC News]], 1 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways Blair's house is similar to [[10 Downing Street]], having even been used as a replica for the official residence of the [[First Lord of the Treasury]] during the filming of the TV series &quot;[[The Alan Clark Diaries]]&quot;. It has been speculated that part of the house is to be converted into offices for a future Blair Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.londondirectory.co.uk/Connaught_Square/ London Directory: Connaught Square]&lt;/ref&gt; The houses on the west side back onto Archery Close, a very quiet, dead end picturesque [[mews]] street. Beyond Archery Close is St George's Field, built on the site of the burial ground of [[St George's, Hanover Square]].

There is now a considerable police presence around the Blairs' residence, with at least four officers from the [[Metropolitan Police Service]]'s [[Diplomatic Protection Group]] present at the house at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1218408/Your-2m-year-guard-Tony-Blair-Former-PM-15m-leaving-office.html Your £2m a year bill to guard Tony Blair] ''[[Daily Mail]]''.

As well as houses, the square also contains other enterprises including a very small primary school and doctor’s surgery:

* Dr R. O'Hare — [[National Health Service]] medical practice
* Connaught House School
* John Outram — Architects 
* Ravn Systems — IT consulting company

There is also a garage specialising in classic cars on Connaught Street to the north of the square. To the west on Connaught Street are the shops of 'Connaught Village' which include Markus [[Coffee]], one of the first specialist coffee roasters in London founded by Hungarian refugees in 1956, which supplies many of the best London hotels with freshly roasted coffee, roasted on the premises, and the Chinese restaurant which was the location of dealings during the Grobbelaar football bungs scandal.

{{other uses2|Diplomat}}
A '''diplomat''' is a person appointed by a [[State (polity)|state]] to conduct [[diplomacy]] with another state or [[international organization]]. The main functions of diplomats revolve around the representation and protection of the interests and nationals of the sending state, as well as the promotion of information and friendly relations.

Diplomats are the oldest form of any of the [[foreign policy]] institutions of the state, predating by centuries [[foreign minister]]s and ministerial offices.
==Etymology==
The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] διπλωμάτης, ''diplōmátēs'', the holder of a [[diploma]] (a folded paper, literally a &quot;folding&quot;), referring in this case not to an educational certificate but to a diplomat's [[Letter_of_Credence|letters]] of [[Diplomatic_accreditation|accreditation]], which enable him or her to carry out duties on behalf of one country or institution within the jurisdiction of another country or institution.
== Terminology ==
{{main|Diplomatic rank}}

The ranks of diplomats— [[ambassador]], [[envoy]]s, [[Minister (government)|minister]]s, and ''[[chargé d’affaires]]'' — are determined by international law, namely the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] of 1961.

Diplomats can be contrasted with [[Consul (representative)|consuls]], [[attachés]], who represent their state in a number of administrative ways, but who don’t have the diplomat’s political functions.

== Function ==
Diplomats in posts collect and report information that could affect national interests, often with advice about how the home country government should respond. Then, once any policy response has been decided in the home country's capital, posts bear major responsibility for implementing it. Diplomats have the job of conveying, in the most persuasive way possible, the views of the home government to the governments to which they are accredited and, in doing so, to try to convince those governments to act in ways that suit home country interests. In this way, diplomats are part of the beginning and the end of each loop in the continuous process through which [[foreign policy]] is made.

In general, it has become harder for diplomats to act autonomously. Whereas in the past [[Thomas Jefferson]] could write to his [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], &quot;We have not heard from our Ambassador in Spain for two years. If we do not hear from him this year, let us write him a letter&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Abba Eban, ''Diplomacy for the Next Century'' (New Heaven, CT: Yale University Press, 1998) at 92.&lt;/ref&gt; secure communication systems, emails and mobile telephones can track down and instruct the most reclusive head of mission. The same technology in reverse gives diplomats the capacity for more immediate input about the policy-making processes in the home capital.

[[E-mail encryption|Secure email]] has transformed the contact between diplomats and the ministry. It is less likely to be leaked, and enables more personal contact than the formal [[cablegram]], with its wide distribution and impersonal style.

=== Reporting ===

=== Advocacy ===

The home country will usually send instructions to a diplomatic post on what foreign policy goals to pursue, but decisions on tactics - who needs to be influenced, what will best persuade them, who are potential allies and adversaries, and how it can be done - are for the diplomats overseas to make.

In this operation, the intelligence, integrity, cultural understanding and energy of individual diplomats are critical. If they are any good at their jobs, they will have developed relationships grounded in trust and mutual understanding with influential members of the country in which they are accredited. They will have worked hard to understand the motives, thought patterns and [[culture]] of the other side.

=== Negotiation ===

The diplomat should be an excellent negotiator but, above all, a catalyst for peace and understanding between peoples. The role is the principal element in the peaceful relations between states because its scope ends when the fighting starts war and could, at best, act simultaneously.

== Training ==

Most diplomats have [[university]] [[academic degree|degrees]] in [[international relations]], [[political science]], [[economics]], or [[law]].&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Seldowitz, &quot;The Psychology of Diplomatic Conflict Resolution,&quot; in H. J. Langholtz and C. E.Stout, Eds. ''The Psychology of Diplomacy'' (Westport: Praeger, 2004), pp. 47–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Status and public image ==

Diplomats have generally been considered members of an exclusive and prestigious profession. The public image of diplomats has been described as &quot;a caricature of pinstriped men gliding their way around a never-ending global cocktail party&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Allan Gyngell and Michael Wesley, ''Making Australian Foreign Policy'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), pp. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; J. W. Burton has noted that &quot;despite the absence of any specific professional training, diplomacy has a high professional status, due perhaps to a degree of secrecy and mystery that its practitioners self-consciously promote.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Burton, ''Systems, States, Diplomacy and Rules'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1968), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; The state supports the high status, privileges and [[self-esteem]] of its diplomats in order to support its own international status and position.

The high regard for diplomats is also due to most countries' conspicuous selection of diplomats, with regard to their professionality and ability to behave according to a certain [[etiquette]], in order to effectively promote their interests. Also, [[international law]] grants diplomats extensive privileges and [[diplomatic immunity|immunities]], which further distinguished the diplomat from the status of an ordinary citizen.

== Psychology ==

While posted overseas, there is a danger that diplomats may become disconnected from their own country and culture. Sir [[Harold Nicolson]] acknowledged that diplomats can become &quot;denationalised, internationalised and therefore dehydrated, an elegant empty husk&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Nicolson, ''The Evolution of Diplomacy'' (New York: Collier, 1962) at 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uniform==
{{main|Diplomatic uniform}}
From about 1800 to after the Second World War, diplomats from most countries wore official uniforms at public occasions. Such uniforms are now retained by only a few diplomatic services, and are seldom worn.

'''Edinburgh''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=edinburgh.ogg|ˈ|ɛ|d|ɪ|n|b|ʌ|r|ə}} {{respell|ED|in-burr-ə}}; [[Scottish Gaelic]]: '''Dùn Èideann''') is the capital city of Scotland and the seat of the [[Scottish Parliament]]. It is the second largest city in Scotland and the [[List of largest United Kingdom settlements by population|seventh most populous]] in the United Kingdom. The [[City of Edinburgh Council]] governs one of Scotland's 32 [[Local government in Scotland|local government]] [[Council areas of Scotland|council areas]]. The council area includes urban Edinburgh and a {{convert|30|sqmi|km2}} rural area. Located in the south-east of Scotland, Edinburgh lies on the east coast of the [[Central Belt]], along the [[Firth of Forth]], near the [[North Sea]].

The city is one of the historical major centres of [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]], led by the [[University of Edinburgh]], helping to earn it the nickname ''Athens of the North''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/scottishenlightenment/scotland/edinburgh.asp|title=Edinburgh, the 'Athens of the North'|publisher=[[Learning and Teaching Scotland]]|accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]] and [[New Town of Edinburgh|New Town]] districts of Edinburgh were listed as a [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 1995 in recognition of the unique character of the Medieval Old Town and the planned Georgian New Town. It covers both the Old and New Towns together with the [[Dean Village]] and the [[Calton Hill]] areas. There are over 4,500 [[listed buildings]] within the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/internet/Environment/Planning_buildings_i_i_/Built_heritage/CEC_conservation_in_edinburgh_ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070522050108/http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/internet/Environment/Planning_buildings_i_i_/Built_heritage/CEC_conservation_in_edinburgh_ |archivedate=22 May 2007 |title=Conservation in Edinburgh |accessdate=20 May 2007 |publisher=The City of Edinburgh Council }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, it had a total of 40 [[conservation area]]s covering 23% of the building stock and 23% of the population, the highest such ratios of any major city in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;City of Edinburgh statistics, May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010 mid-year population estimates, Edinburgh had a total resident population of 486,120.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edinburghpop&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/statistics/theme/population/estimates/mid-year/2010/index.html|title=General Register Office for Scotland – mid-2010 population estimates by sex, single year of age and administrative area}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city hosts the annual [[Edinburgh Festival]], a group of official and independent festivals held annually over about four weeks beginning in early August. The number of visitors attracted to Edinburgh for the Festival is roughly equal to the settled population of the city. The best-known of these events are the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], the largest performing-arts festival in the world; the [[Edinburgh International Festival]]; the [[Edinburgh Military Tattoo]]; and the [[Edinburgh International Book Festival]]. Other events include the [[Hogmanay]] street party and the [[Beltane Fire Festival]]. Edinburgh attracts over 1 million overseas visitors a year, making it the second most visited tourist destination in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=178 |title=National Statistics Online – International Visits |accessdate=19 July 2009 |publisher=ONS }}{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{main|Etymology of Edinburgh}}
The name &quot;Edinburgh&quot; appears to derive from the [[Celtic language|Celtic]] [[British language|British]] place name ''Eidyn'', mentioned in a number of medieval [[Welsh language|Welsh]] sources.&lt;ref name=Williams47&gt;{{Cite book |title= The Beginnings of Welsh Poetry: Studies|last= Williams|first= Ifor|authorlink= Ifor Williams|year= 1972|publisher= University of Wales Press|location= |isbn= 0708300359|page= 47|pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chadwick107&gt;{{Cite book |title= The British Heroic Age: the Welsh and the Men of the North|last= Chadwick|first= Nora K.|authorlink= Nora Kershaw Chadwick|year= 1968 |publisher= University of Wales Press|location= |isbn=0708304656|page= 107|pages= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dumville&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Dumville|first1= David |year= 1994|title= The eastern terminus of the Antonine Wall: 12th or 13th century evidence|journal= Proceedings of the Society of the Antiquaries of Scotland|volume= 124 |issue= |pages= 293–298|publisher= |doi= |url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|297}} [[Kenneth H. Jackson]] argued strongly that &quot;Eidyn&quot; referred exclusively to the location of modern Edinburgh,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = The Gododdin: The Oldest Scottish Poem | last1 = Jackson | first1 = Kenneth H. | authorlink1 = Kenneth H. Jackson | year = 1969 | publisher= Edinburgh University Press| isbn= | pages = 77–78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but others, such as [[Ifor Williams]] and [[Nora K. Chadwick]], suggest it applied to the wider area as well.&lt;ref name=Williams1972&gt;{{Cite book |title= The Beginnings of Welsh Poetry: Studies|last= Williams|first= Ifor|authorlink= Ifor Williams|year= 1972|publisher= University of Wales Press|isbn= 0708300359}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chadwick&gt;{{Cite book |title= The British Heroic Age: the Welsh and the Men of the North|last= Chadwick|first= Nora K.|authorlink= Nora Kershaw Chadwick|year= 1968 |publisher= University of Wales Press|isbn=0708304656}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name &quot;Eidyn&quot; may survive today in other toponyms, such as ''Dunedin'' and ''[[Carriden]]'' (from ''[[Caer]] Eidyn''), fifteen miles to the west.&lt;ref name=Dumville/&gt;
[[File:Edinburgh Castle Rock.jpg|thumb|left|[[Edinburgh Castle]]]]

Present-day Edinburgh was the location of ''Din Eidyn'', a [[dun]] or [[hillfort]] associated with the kingdom of the [[Gododdin]].&lt;ref name=gododdin&gt;Gardens of the 'Gododdin' Craig Cessford Garden History, Vol. 22, No. 1 (Summer, 1994), pp. 114–115 doi:10.2307/1587005&lt;/ref&gt; The modern Scottish Gaelic name &quot;Dùn Eideann&quot; derives directly from the British ''Din Eidyn''; the English and Scots form are similar, adding the element -''[[burgh]]'', from the [[Old English]] ''[[burh]]'', also meaning fort.&lt;ref name=Room&gt;{{cite book |title= Placenames of the World|last= Room |first= Adrian |authorlink= |coauthors=  |year= 2006 |publisher= McFarland |location= |isbn= 0786422483 |page= |pages= 118–119 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources claim Edinburgh's name is derived from an Old English form such as ''Eadwinesburh'', in reference to the 7th century king [[Edwin of Northumbria]].&lt;ref&gt;Blackie, ''Geographical Etymology: A Dictionary of Place-names Giving Their Derivations'', 68.&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern scholarship refutes this, as the form ''Eidyn'' predates Edwin.&lt;ref name=Room/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gelling&gt;{{cite book |title= The Names of Towns and Cities in Britain|last= Gelling|first= Margaret |authorlink= Margaret Gelling |coauthors= [[W.

The first evidence of the existence of the town as a separate entity from the fort lies in an early 12th century [[royal charter]], generally thought to date from 1124, by [[David I of Scotland|King David I]] granting land to the [[Church of the Holy Rood]] of Edinburgh. This suggests that the town came into official existence between 1018 (when [[Malcolm II of Scotland|King Malcolm II]] secured the [[Lothians]] from the [[Northumbria]]ns) and 1124.&lt;ref&gt;Two Notes on the Norse Kingdoms in Northumbria A. Campbell The English Historical Review, Vol. 57, No. 225 (January 1942), pp. 85–97&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1170s [[William I of Scotland|King William the Lion]] was using the name &quot;''Edenesburch''&quot; in a charter (in [[Latin language|Latin]]) confirming the 1124 grant of David I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5GIPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA800&amp;dq=edenesburch+king+william#v=onepage&amp;q=edenesburch%20king%20william&amp;f=false|title=The Topographical, Statistical, and Historical Gazeteer of Scotland: A-H|page=800|year=1842|accessdate=17 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Further|[[Timeline of Edinburgh history]]}}
Humans have settled the Edinburgh area from at least the [[Bronze Age]], leaving traces of primitive stone settlements at Holyrood, [[Craiglockhart]] Hill and the [[Pentland Hills]] for example.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lost Edinburgh pp. 1/2&quot;&gt;Coghill, Hamish ''Lost Edinburgh'' pp.&amp;nbsp;1/2.&lt;/ref&gt; Local culture was influenced through the [[Iron Age]] by [[Hallstatt]] and [[La Tene]] [[Celts|Celtic]] cultures from central Europe. By the time the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] arrived in Lothian at the beginning of the 1st millennium AD, they discovered a Celtic [[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] tribe whose name they recorded as [[Votadini]], likely to be a Latin version of the name they called themselves.

The Angles of Northumbria had a significant influence in what was to become South-East Scotland, notably from AD 638 when it appears the [[Gododdin]] stronghold was besieged. Though far from exclusive (''cf'' [[Picts]] and [[Scottish people|Scots]]), this influence continued over three centuries. It was not until c. AD 950 when, during the reign of [[Indulf]], son of [[Constantine II of Scotland|Constantine II]], the city, referred to at this time in the [[Pictish Chronicle]] as 'oppidum Eden',&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson, 1926 p.340&quot;&gt;Watson, ''The Celtic Place Names of Scotland'' (1926), p.340&lt;/ref&gt; fell to the Scots and finally remained under their jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch et al., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (2001), p.658&lt;/ref&gt; During this period of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] influence in south east Scotland, when the city's name gained its Germanic suffix, 'burgh', the seeds for the language we know today as [[Scots language|Scots]] were sown.
[[File:Edinburgh in the 17thC (detail) by Wenceslas Hollar (1670).jpg|thumb|left|360px|Edinburgh in the 17th century]]

By the 12th century Edinburgh, founded upon the famous castle rock, the volcanic [[crag and tail]] geological feature shaped by 2 million years of glacial activity, was well established becoming one of the earliest Scottish [[Royal Burgh]]s. Founded in the mid 12th century, a separate [[Burgh of regality]], known as [[the Canongate]] and held by the [[Abbey of Holyrood]], developed to the East. Through the late medieval period Edinburgh grew quickly and continued to flourish economically and culturally through the [[Renaissance]] period. It was at the centre of the 16th century [[Scottish Reformation]] and the [[Covenanters|Wars of the Covenant]] a hundred years later.

In 1603, [[King James VI]] of Scotland succeeded to the English throne, uniting the two kingdoms in a [[personal union]] known as the [[Union of the Crowns]]. Scotland remained a sovereign kingdom with the [[Parliament of Scotland]] in Edinburgh. King James VI progressed to London where he established his court, maintaining his rule in Scotland through his [[Privy Council of Scotland|Privy Council]] which merely received his written instructions and executed his will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nas.gov.uk/guides/privyCouncil.asp | title = Privy council records | accessdate = 2012-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite promising to return every three years, he returned to Edinburgh only once, in 1617.

Disputes between the [[Presbyterian]] [[Covenanters]] and the [[Anglican Church]] in 1639 led to the [[Bishops' Wars]], the initial conflict of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. During the [[Third English Civil War]] Edinburgh was taken by the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] forces of [[Oliver Cromwell]] prior to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]'s eventual defeat at the [[Battle of Worcester]].

In 17th century Edinburgh a defensive wall, built in the 16th century largely as protection against English invasion following James IV's defeat at the [[Battle of Flodden]] and hence named the Flodden Wall, still defined the boundaries of the city. Due to the restricted land area available for development, houses increased in height instead. Buildings of 11 storeys were common and there are records of buildings as high as 14 or even 15 storeys,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BFkLAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Notices+of+the+most+remarkable+fires+in+Edinburgh,+from+1385+to+1824#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = Notices of the most remarkable fires in Edinburgh, from 1385 to 1824 | accessdate =10 September 2010 | last = Chambers | first = Robert | year = 1824}}&lt;/ref&gt; an early version of the modern-day skyscraper. Many of the stone-built structures can still be seen today in the Old Town.

In 1706 and 1707 the [[Act of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] were passed by the Parliaments of England and Scotland uniting the two Kingdoms into the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. As a consequence, the Parliament of Scotland merged with the Parliament of England to form the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], which sat at [[Westminster]] in London. The union was opposed by many Scots at the time and this led to riots within the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xpZy8nEtE4cC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=1707+acts+of+union+saw+riots+in+edinburgh#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The making of the United Kingdom and Black peoples of the Americas|last= Kelly|year=1998|publisher=Heinemann|page=77|accessdate=23 January 2011|isbn=9780435309596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From early times, and certainly from the 14th century, Edinburgh (like other royal burghs of Scotland) used armorial devices in many ways, including on seals. In 1732, the 'achievement' or 'coat of arms' was formally granted by the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]]. These arms were used by Edinburgh Town Council until the reorganisation of local government in Scotland in May 1975, when it was succeeded by the City of Edinburgh District Council and a new coat of arms, based on the earlier one, was granted. In 1996, further local government reorganisation resulted in the formation of the City of Edinburgh Council, and again the coat of arms was updated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/info/788/council-general_information/1162/coat_of_arms_of_the_city_of_edinburgh_council/1|title=Council coat of arms |publisher=Edinburgh.gov.uk |accessdate=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Edinburgh from the West.jpg|thumb|An 1802 illustration of Edinburgh from the west]]

During the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] rising of 1745, Edinburgh was briefly occupied by Jacobite forces before their march into England. Following their ultimate defeat at the [[Battle of Culloden]], near [[Inverness]], there was a period of reprisals and pacification, largely directed at the Catholic Highlanders. In Edinburgh the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] monarch attempted to gain favour by supporting new developments to the north of the castle, naming streets in honour of the King and his family; George Street, Frederick Street, Hanover Street and [[Princes Street]], named in honour of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]'s two sons.

The city was at the heart of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8nS5CMLeamwC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=edinburgh+was+at+the+heart+of+the+scottish+enlightenment#v=onepage&amp;q=edinburgh%20was%20at%20the%20heart%20of%20the%20scottish%20enlightenment&amp;f=false|title=William Robertson and the expansion of empire|publisher=University Press, Cambridge|author=William Robertson|year=1997|page=2|accessdate=18 February 2011|isbn=9780521570831}}&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrities from across the continent would be seen in the city streets, among them famous Scots such as [[David Hume]], [[Walter Scott]], [[Robert Adam]], [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]], [[Robert Burns]], [[James Hutton]] and [[Adam Smith]]. Edinburgh became a major cultural centre, earning it the nickname ''Athens of the North'' because of the [[Greco-Roman]] style of the [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]]'s architecture, as well as the rise of the Scottish intellectual elite who were increasingly leading both Scottish and European intellectual thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PNhT1uVIZvYC&amp;pg=PA323&amp;dq=athens+of+the+north+edinburgh#v=onepage&amp;q=athens%20of%20the%20north%20edinburgh&amp;f=false|title=Blackwood's Edinburgh magazine, Volume 11|year=1822|page=323|accessdate=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, Edinburgh, like many cities, industrialised, but did not grow as fast as Scotland's second city, [[Glasgow]], which replaced it as the largest city in the country, benefiting greatly at the height of the [[British Empire]].

The [[Scotland Act 1998]] which came into force in 1999 established a [[Devolution|devolved]] [[Scottish parliament]] and [[Scottish Executive]], both based in Edinburgh responsible for governing Scotland, with [[Reserved and excepted matters|reserved matters]] such as defence, taxation and foreign affairs remaining the responsibility of [[Westminster Parliament|Westminster]].

{{Main|Areas of Edinburgh}}

Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, is divided into areas that generally encompass a park (sometimes known as &quot;[[links (golf)|links]]&quot;), a main local street (i.e. street of local retail shops), a high street (the historic main street, not always the same as the main local street, such as in Corstorphine) and residential buildings. In Edinburgh many residences are [[tenements]], although the more southern and western parts of the city have traditionally been more affluent and have a greater number of detached and semi-detached villas.

The historic centre of Edinburgh is divided into two by the broad green swath of [[Princes Street Gardens]]. To the south the view is dominated by [[Edinburgh Castle]], perched atop the extinct volcanic crag, and the long sweep of the [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]] trailing after it along the ridge. To the north lies Princes Street and the [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]]. The gardens were begun in 1816 on [[bog]]land which had once been the [[Nor Loch]].

To the immediate west of the castle lies the financial district, housing insurance and banking buildings. Probably the most noticeable building here is the circular sandstone building that is the [[Edinburgh International Conference Centre]].

===Old Town===
{{Main|Old Town, Edinburgh}}
[[File:Edinburgh map.png|thumb|left|Map of the city, showing New Town, Old Town, and the West End.]]
The Old Town has preserved its medieval plan and many [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]]-era buildings. One end is closed by the castle and the main artery, the [[Royal Mile]], leads away from it; minor streets (called ''closes'' or ''[[wynd]]s'') lead downhill on either side of the main spine in a herringbone pattern. Large squares mark the location of markets or surround public buildings such as [[St. Giles' Cathedral]] and the [[Courts of Scotland|Law Courts]]. Other notable places nearby include the [[Royal Museum of Scotland]], Surgeons' Hall and McEwan Hall. The street layout is typical of the old quarters of many northern European cities, and where the castle perches on top of a rocky crag (the remnants of an extinct volcano) the Royal Mile runs down the crest of a ridge from it.

Due to space restrictions imposed by the narrowness of the &quot;tail&quot;, the Old Town became home to some of the earliest &quot;high rise&quot; residential buildings. Multi-storey dwellings known as ''lands'' were the norm from the 16th century onwards with ten and eleven storeys being typical and one even reaching fourteen or fifteen storeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Chambers | first1 = Robert | authorlink1 = Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802) | title = Notices of the most remarkable fires in Edinburgh: from 1385 to 1824 ... | url = http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BFkLAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Notices+of+the+most+remarkable+fires+in+Edinburgh,+from+1385+to+1824&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-a7sysfr7I&amp;sig=XRNYc1Kx7qx_B3LHZF63A9jyC2w&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FIKKTIi9KYaX4Abs8ajsCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=fifteen&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2012-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, numerous vaults below street level were inhabited to accommodate the influx of immigrants during the [[Industrial Revolution]].

{{wide image|Edinburghpano09.jpg|1500px|Panoramic view of the [[North Bridge, Edinburgh|North Bridge]] and north elevation of the [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]]}}

===New Town===
{{Main|New Town, Edinburgh}}
The New Town was an 18th century solution to the problem of an increasingly crowded Old Town.
The city had remained incredibly compact, confined to the ridge running down from the castle.
In 1766 a competition to design the New Town was won by [[James Craig (architect)|James Craig]], a 22-year-old architect. The plan that was built created a rigid, ordered grid, which fitted well with [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] ideas of rationality. The principal street was to be [[George Street, Edinburgh|George Street]], which follows the natural ridge to the north of the Old Town. Either side of it are the other main streets of Princes Street and Queen Street. Princes Street has since become the main shopping street in Edinburgh, and few [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] buildings survive on it. Linking these streets were a series of perpendicular streets. At the east and west ends are [[St. Andrew Square, Edinburgh|St. Andrew Square]] and [[Charlotte Square]] respectively. The latter, designed by [[Robert Adam]], influenced Edinburgh street architecture into the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/architectsactive.pdf|title=Scottish Architects Homecoming|publisher=Historic Scotland|accessdate=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bute House]], the official residence of the [[First Minister of Scotland]], is on the north side of Charlotte Square.
Sitting in the hollow between the Old and New Towns was the [[Nor Loch]], which had been both the city's water supply and place for dumping [[sewage]]. By the 1820s it was drained. Craig's original plans included Princes Street Gardens and an ornamental canal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princes-street.com/history.html History of princes Street] Retrieved 7 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; in place of the Nor Loch. Excess soil from the construction of the buildings was dumped into the [[loch]], creating what is now [[The Mound]] and the canal idea was abandoned. In the mid-19th century the [[National Gallery of Scotland]] and [[Royal Scottish Academy Building]] were built on The Mound, and tunnels to [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Waverley Station]] driven through it.
The New Town was so successful that it was extended greatly. The grid pattern was not maintained, but rather a more picturesque layout was created.

{{wide image|Edinburghfromcastlepano09.jpg|1500px|[[Edinburgh New Town]] viewed from Edinburgh Castle}}

===Southside===
A popular residential part of the city is its south side, comprising a number of areas including St Leonards, [[Marchmont]], [[Newington, Edinburgh|Newington]], [[Sciennes]], [[The Grange, Edinburgh|The Grange]] and [[Blackford, Edinburgh|Blackford]]. The Edinburgh &quot;Southside&quot; is broadly analogous to the area covered by the [[Burgh Muir]], and grew in popularity as a residential area following the opening of the [[South Bridge, Edinburgh|South Bridge]]. These areas are particularly popular now with families (many state and private schools are here), students (the central University of Edinburgh campus is based around George Square just north of Marchmont and [[The Meadows (park)|the Meadows]], and [[Napier University]] (with major campuses around Merchiston &amp; Morningside), as well as with visiting festival-goers.
These areas are also the subject of several works of fiction: [[Ian Rankin]]'s [[Inspector Rebus]] lives in Marchmont and worked in St Leonards; and Churchhill, in Morningside, was the home of [[Muriel Spark]]'s Miss Jean Brodie.

===Leith===
[[File:Leith burgh coat-of-arms on a lamppost.jpg|thumb|upright|120px|Leith lamppost motif]]
{{Main|Leith}}
Leith is the port of Edinburgh. It still retains a separate identity from Edinburgh, and it was a matter of great resentment when, in 1920, the [[burgh]] of Leith was merged&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/leith/33.htm|title=The Story of Leith XXXIII. How Leith was Governed}}&lt;/ref&gt; into the [[Counties of Scotland|county of]] Edinburgh. Even today the parliamentary seat is known as 'Edinburgh North ''and'' Leith'. With the redevelopment of Leith, Edinburgh has gained the business of a number of cruise liner companies which now provide cruises to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands. Leith also has the [[Royal Yacht Britannia]], berthed behind the [[Ocean Terminal, Edinburgh|Ocean Terminal]] and [[Easter Road]], the home ground of [[Hibernian F.C]].
{{clearleft}}

===Urban area===
The urban area of Edinburgh is almost entirely contained within the [[City of Edinburgh Council]] boundary, merging with [[Musselburgh]] in [[East Lothian]]. Nearby towns close to the city borders include [[Dunfermline]], [[Bonnyrigg]], [[Dalkeith]], [[Loanhead]], [[Newtongrange]], [[Penicuik]], [[Livingston, Scotland|Livingston]] and [[Broxburn, West Lothian|Broxburn]]. The EU classifies this area as a [[Larger Urban Zone]] with a population of nearly 800,000 people.

[[File:Tenements in Wardrop's Court.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The cramped tenements off the [[Royal Mile]] were once home to most of Edinburgh's population.]]

There is evidence of human habitation on [[Castle Rock, Edinburgh|Castle Rock]] from as early as 3,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, B. &amp; Jenkins, P. (2005) p21&lt;/ref&gt; A census conducted by the Edinburgh presbytery in 1592 estimated a population of 8,000 scattered equally north and south of the High Street which runs down the spine of the ridge leading from the Castle.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, M. (2001), p219&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th and 19th Centuries, the population began to expand rapidly, rising from 49,000 in 1751 to 136,000 in 1831 primarily due to rural out-migration.&lt;ref name=&quot;overcrowding&quot;&gt;Edwards, B. &amp; Jenkins, P. (2005), p9&lt;/ref&gt; As the population swelled, overcrowding problems in the Old Town, particularly in the cramped [[tenements]] that lined the present day Royal Mile and [[Cowgate]], were exacerbated.&lt;ref name=&quot;overcrowding&quot;/&gt; Sanitary problems and disease were rife.&lt;ref name=&quot;overcrowding&quot;/&gt; The construction of [[James Craig (architect)|James Craig's]] masterplanned New Town from 1766 onwards witnessed the migration of the professional classes from the Old Town to the lower density, higher quality surroundings taking shape on land to the north.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, B. &amp; Jenkins, P. (2005) p46&lt;/ref&gt; Expansion southwards from the Royal Mile/Cowgate axis of the Old Town saw more tenements being built in the 19th century, giving rise to present day areas such as [[Marchmont]], [[Newington, Edinburgh|Newington]] and [[Bruntsfield]].&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, P. in Edwards, B. &amp; Jenkins, P. (2005), p46&lt;/ref&gt;

Early 20th century population growth coincided with lower density suburban development in areas such as [[Gilmerton, Edinburgh|Gilmerton]], [[Liberton, Scotland|Liberton]] and [[South Gyle]]. As the city expanded to the south and west, detached and semi detached villas with large gardens replaced tenements as the predominant building style. Nonetheless, the 2001 census revealed that over 55% of Edinburgh's population live in tenements or blocks of flats compared to the Scottish average of 33.5%.&lt;ref name=&quot;dwellings&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.edinburgh.gov.uk/Census_2001_City_Comparisons/CCTable4Dwellings.pdf |title=Edinburgh Comparisons – Dwellings |accessdate=8 February 2009 |publisher=City of Edinburgh Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the early to mid 20th century many new estates were built in areas such as [[Craigmillar]], [[Niddrie, Edinburgh|Niddrie]], [[Pilton, Edinburgh|Pilton]], [[Muirhouse]], [[Piershill]] and [[Sighthill, Edinburgh|Sighthill]], linked to slum clearances in the Old Town.

There were estates built in North Edinburgh in the 1950s to cope with overcrowding in the inner city, [[Clermiston]] is one such estate.

Banking has been a part of the economic life of Edinburgh for over 300 years, with the establishment of the [[Bank of Scotland]] – now part of the [[Lloyds Banking Group]] – by an act of the original [[Parliament of Scotland]] in 1695. Today, together with the financial services industry, with particular strengths in insurance and investment underpinned by the presence of Edinburgh based firms such as [[Scottish Widows]] and [[Standard Life]], Edinburgh is the UK's second financial centre after London and Europe's fourth by equity assets.&lt;ref name=&quot;financial&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edinburgh-inspiringcapital.com/invest/key_business_sectors/financial_services.aspx|title=Edinburgh's financial services sector|accessdate=11 May 2010 |publisher=Edinburgh Brand }}&lt;/ref&gt; In world terms, it ranks ahead of [[Dubai]], Amsterdam and Washington D.C. in the [[Global Financial Centres Index]].&lt;ref name=&quot;financial&quot;/&gt; The [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] opened its new global headquarters at [[Gogarburn]] in the west of the city in October 2005.

Tourism is an important economic mainstay in the city. As a [[World Heritage Site]], tourists come to visit such historical sites as Edinburgh Castle, the [[Palace of Holyroodhouse]] and the Georgian [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]]. This is augmented in August of each year with the presence of the [[Edinburgh Festival]]s, which bring in over 4.4&amp;nbsp;million visitors,&lt;ref name=&quot;Edinburgh Economy Watch April 2010&quot;/&gt; and generate in excess of £100m for the Edinburgh economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edfringe.com/story.html?id=923 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927195132/http://www.edfringe.com/story.html?id=923 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |title=2004 Festival Economic Impact Study results |accessdate=23 March 2007 |date=14 October 2005 |publisher=Edinburgh Festival Fringe }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the centre of Scotland's government, as well as its [[Scots Law|legal system]], the public sector plays a central role in the economy of Edinburgh, with many departments of the [[Scottish Government]] located in the city.

Culturally, Edinburgh is best known for the [[Edinburgh Festival]], which is a series of separate events running from the end of July until early September each year. The longest established festival is the [[Edinburgh International Festival]], which first ran in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5140294.stm#international|title=The arts go on show in Edinburgh|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=12 January 2011|first=Charles|last=Pamment|date=28 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Festival centres on a programme of high-profile theatre productions and classical music performances, featuring international directors, conductors, theatre companies and orchestras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/8570849.stm|title='New world' theme for Edinburgh International Festival|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=12 January 2011|date=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Festival has since been overtaken in both size and popularity by the [[Edinburgh Fringe]]. What began as a programme of marginal acts has become the largest arts festival in the world, with 1867 different shows being staged in 2006, in 261 venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-10855725|title=Stage set for Edinburgh Fringe success|publisher=BBC News Edinburgh, East, &amp; Fife|date=August 2010|accessdate=12 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comedy is now one of the mainstays of the Fringe, with numerous notable comedians getting their 'break' here, often through receipt of the [[Edinburgh Comedy Awards|Edinburgh Comedy Award]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edfringe.com/news/edinburgh-festival-fringe-2010-programme-unveiled|title=Edinburgh festival fringe 2010 programme unveiled|publisher=The Edinburgh Festival fringe|accessdate=12 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-11114711|title=Kane wins Edinburgh comedy award|publisher=BBC News Scotland|month=08|year=2010|accessdate=12 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008 the largest comedy venues on the Edinburgh Fringe launched as a festival within a festival, labelled the [[Edinburgh Comedy Festival]]. Already at its inception it was the largest comedy festival in the world.&lt;ref name=edcomfest&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edcomfest.com/index.aspx |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080626173159/http://www.edcomfest.com/index.aspx |archivedate=26 June 2008|title=Edinburgh Comedy Festival 2008 Introduction |accessdate=4 February 2008 |work=Official site of the Edinburgh Comedy Festival }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Alongside these major festivals, there is also the Edinburgh Art Festival, [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]] (moved to June from 2008), the Edinburgh Jazz and Blues Festival, and the [[Edinburgh International Book Festival]]. [[The Edge Festival]] (formerly known as T on the Fringe), a popular music offshoot of the Fringe, began in 2000, replacing the smaller Flux and Planet Pop series of shows.&lt;ref name=&quot;fringe&quot;/&gt;

Running concurrently with the summer festivals, the [[Edinburgh Military Tattoo]] occupies the Castle Esplanade every night, with massed [[bagpipes|pipers]] and fireworks. As well as the various summer festivals there is also the [[Edinburgh International Science Festival]]. Held annually in April it is one of the largest of its kind in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Business-Industry/science/Scienceengagement/sciencefestivals|title=Scottish Science Festivals|publisher=The Scottish Government|accessdate=12 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Celebrations===
[[File:Edinburgh Hogmanay Longship.jpg|thumb|A Viking longship being burnt during Edinburgh's annual [[Hogmanay]] celebrations.]]
Equally famous is the annual [[Hogmanay]] celebration. Originally a street party held on Princes Street and the [[Royal Mile]], the Hogmanay event has been officially organised since 1993. In 1996, over 300,000 people attended, leading to ticketing of the main street party in later years, with a limit of 100,000 tickets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hogmanay&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A10358165|title=Hogmanay-the Scottish New Year|publisher=BBC |date=10 May 2006|accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hogmanay now covers four days of processions, concerts and fireworks, with the street party commencing on Hogmanay. During the street party Princes Street is accessible by ticket only, with live bands playing, food and drink stalls, and a clear view of the castle and fireworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/features/Edinburgh39s-Hogmanay-the-party-to.6673980.jp|title=Edinburgh's Hogmanay: the party to end all parties|work=The Scotsman |location=UK |date=29 December 2010|accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative tickets are available for entrance into the Princes Street Gardens concert and [[Céilidh]], where well known artists perform and ticket holders are invited to participate in traditional Scottish céilidh dancing. The event attracts thousands of people from all over the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hogmanay&quot;/&gt;

On the night of 30 April, the [[Beltane Fire Festival]] takes place on Edinburgh's [[Calton Hill, Edinburgh|Calton Hill]]. The festival involves a procession followed by the re-enactment of scenes inspired by [[paganism|pagan]] spring fertility celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/edinburgh/Pagan-fire-festival-reignites-with.2504759.jp|title=Pagan fire festival reignites with a fee|work=The Scotsman |location=UK |date=19 February 2004|accessdate=13 January 2011|location=Edinburgh|first=Alastair|last=Jamieson}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of October each year, the [[Navratri|Dussehra]] Hindu Festival is also held on Calton Hill.&lt;ref&gt;McEwan, Allen, [http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/evening-news-video-archive/Festival-is-flaming-marvellous.4560948.jp Festival is flaming marvellous], The [[Edinburgh Evening News]], 2008-10-06, Accessed 7 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museums and libraries===
Edinburgh has a large number of museums and libraries, many of which are national institutions. These include the [[Museum of Scotland]], the [[Royal Museum]], the [[National Library of Scotland]], [[National War Museum of Scotland]], the [[Museum of Edinburgh]] and the [[Museum of Childhood (Edinburgh)|Museum of Childhood]].

===Literature and philosophy===
Edinburgh has a long literary tradition, going back to the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] and in more recent years being declared the first [[UNESCO City of Literature]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;Urbanism&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/9413404/Sustainable-Urbanism-Edinburgh|title=Sustainable Urbanism|publisher=Ralf Brand|accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edinburgh's Enlightenment produced philosopher [[David Hume]] and the pioneer of political economy, [[Adam Smith]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Urbanism&quot;/&gt;  Writers such as [[James Boswell]], [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Kenneth Grahame]], [[Muriel Spark]] and Sir [[Walter Scott]] all lived and worked in Edinburgh. Today, the city is the home of many publishing companies. [[J K Rowling]], author of the [[Harry Potter]] novels, is a resident of Edinburgh. Edinburgh has also become associated with the crime novels of [[Ian Rankin]], and the work of [[Irvine Welsh]], whose novels are mostly set in the city and are often written in colloquial [[Scots language|Scots]]. Edinburgh is also home to the international [[Bestseller|best-selling]] author [[Alexander McCall Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Music, theatre and film===
[[File:Festival Theatre.JPG|thumb|The [[Edinburgh Festival Theatre]]]]
[[File:Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|120px|Traverse Theatre]]
Outside festival season, Edinburgh continues to support a number of theatres and production companies. The [[Royal Lyceum Theatre]] has its own company, while the [[King's Theatre, Edinburgh|King's Theatre]], [[Edinburgh Festival Theatre]], and [[Edinburgh Playhouse]] stage large touring shows. The [[Traverse Theatre]] presents a more contemporary programme of plays. [[Edinburgh amateur theatre|Amateur theatre companies]] productions are staged at the [[Bedlam Theatre]], Church Hill Theatre, and the King's Theatre amongst others. [[Youth Music Theatre: UK]] has a regional office in the city.

The [[Usher Hall]] is Edinburgh's premier venue for classical music, as well as the occasional prestige popular music gig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heritage.scotsman.com/nostalgia/As-the-Capital39s-worldrenowned-concert.6110556.jp|title=Heritage &amp; Culture|work=The Scotsman |location=UK |date=27 February 2010|accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other halls staging music and theatre include [[The Hub (Edinburgh)|The Hub]], the [[Assembly Rooms]] and the Queen's Hall. The [[Scottish Chamber Orchestra]] is based in Edinburgh.

Edinburgh has two repertory cinemas, the Edinburgh Filmhouse, and the [[The Cameo, Edinburgh|Cameo]], and the independent [[Dominion Cinema]], as well as the usual range of [[multiplex (cinema)|multiplexes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edinburghguide.com/venues|title=Edinburgh venues|publisher=Edinburgh Guide.com|accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edinburgh has a healthy popular music scene. Occasional large gigs are staged at [[Murrayfield Stadium|Murrayfield]] and [[Meadowbank Stadium|Meadowbank]], with mid-sized events at venues such as the Corn Exchange, HMV Picture House, the Liquid Rooms, and the Bongo Club. Smaller more intimate shows can be found at venues like Cabaret Voltaire, Sneaky Pete's, The Store, The Voodoo Rooms, Bannerman's, Henry's Cellar Bar and Forrest Cafe.

In 2010, [[PRS for Music]] listed Edinburgh amongst the UK's top ten 'most musical' cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/7427088/Bristol-is-UKs-most-musical-city.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Bristol is UK's 'most musical city' | date=12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edinburgh is also home to a flourishing group of contemporary composers such as [[Nigel Osborne]], Peter Nelson, Lyell Cresswell, [[Hafliði Hallgrímsson]], Edward Harper, Robert Crawford, Robert Dow, and [[John McLeod (composer)|John McLeod]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmcleod.uk.com |title=John McLeod: Composer |publisher=Johnmcleod.uk.com |accessdate=8 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose music is heard regularly on BBC Radio 3 and throughout the UK.

[[Rockstar North]], most famously known for creating the [[Grand Theft Auto series]], are based in Edinburgh.

===Media===
The [[Edinburgh Evening News]] is based in Edinburgh and published every day apart from Sunday. The newspaper's owners also hold The Scotsman, a national paper which is published in the city. The Herald also covers Edinburgh, which is published in Glasgow.

The city has two commercial radio stations: [[Forth One]], a station aimed at young listeners with a mainstream chart music output, and [[Forth 2]] on medium wave which plays classic hits. Capital Radio Scotland and Real Radio Scotland also have transmitters in Edinburgh. Along with the UK national radio stations, Radio Scotland and the Gaelic language service [[BBC Nan Gaidheal]] is also broadcast, despite few speakers residing in the city. DAB digital radio is broadcast over two local multiplexes.

Edinburgh, along with the rest of Scotland, had completed the [[digital switchover]] for television. Television, along with most radio services, are broadcast to the city from the [[Craigkelly transmitting station]] situated on the opposite side of the Firth of Forth.

===Visual arts===
[[File:Wfm national gallery scotland.jpg|thumb|The [[National Gallery of Scotland]]]]
Edinburgh contains Scotland's five [[National Galleries of Scotland|National Galleries]] as well as numerous smaller galleries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgalleries.org/|title=Portrait of the Nation|publisher=National Galleries of Scotland|accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national collection is housed in the [[National Gallery of Scotland]], located on the Mound, and now linked to the [[Royal Scottish Academy]], which holds regular major exhibitions of painting. Contemporary collections are shown in the [[Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art]], and the nearby [[Dean Gallery]]. The [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]] focuses on portraits and photography.

The council-owned City Art Centre shows regular art exhibitions. Across the road, The [[Fruitmarket Gallery]] offers world class exhibitions of contemporary art, featuring work by British and international artists with both emerging and established international reputations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/powerofart/cities/edinburgh.shtml|title=Simon Schama's Power of Art|accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are private galleries, including Doggerfisher and Ingleby Gallery, the latter providing a varied programme including shows by [[Callum Innes]], [[Peter Liversidge]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], Richard Forster, and [[Sean Scully]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/stage-visual-arts/trio-grande-1.820517|title=Trio grande|publisher=Heraldscotland|accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city hosts several of Scotland's galleries and organisations dedicated to contemporary visual art. Significant strands of this infrastructure include: The [[Scottish Arts Council]], [[Edinburgh College of Art]], [[Talbot Rice Gallery]] (University of Edinburgh) and the [[Edinburgh Annuale]].

===Nightlife and shopping===
[[File:Edinburgh-Jenners.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jenners|Jenners Department Store, on Princes Street.]]]]
Edinburgh has a large number of pubs, clubs and restaurants. The traditional areas were the [[Grassmarket]], [[Lothian Road]] and surrounding streets, [[Rose Street]] and its surrounds and the Bridges. In recent years [[George Street, Edinburgh|George Street]] in the [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]] has grown in prominence, with a large number of new, upmarket public houses and nightclubs opening, along with a number on the parallel [[Queen Street, Edinburgh|Queen Street]]. [[Stockbridge, Edinburgh|Stockbridge]] and the waterfront at [[Leith]] are also increasingly fashionable areas, with a number of pubs, clubs and restaurants. On a side note on the nightlife, Edinburgh is the Top UK city for male single travelers, according to a recent [http://travel.excite.co.uk/singles-travel-map-europe-N31380.html Excite EU study].

Princes Street is the main shopping area in the city centre, with a wide range of stores from souvenir shops, from chains such as [[Boots the Chemist|Boots]] and [[H&amp;M]] and institutions like [[Jenners]]. George Street, north of Princes Street, is home to a number of upmarket chains and independent stores. The [[St. James Centre]], at the eastern end of George Street and Princes Street, hosts a substantial number of national chains including a large [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]]. [[Multrees Walk]], adjacent to the St. James Centre, is a recent addition to the city centre, hosting brands such as [[Louis Vuitton]], [[Emporio Armani]], [[Mulberry (company)|Mulberry]] and [[Calvin Klein]], with [[Harvey Nichols]] anchoring the development.

Edinburgh also has substantial retail developments outside the city centre. These include [[The Gyle]] and Hermiston Gait in the west of the city, [[Cameron Toll]], Straiton Retail Park and [[Fort Kinnaird]] in the south and east, and [[Ocean Terminal, Edinburgh|Ocean Terminal]] to the north, on the [[Leith]] waterfront. The [[Royal Yacht Britannia]] lies in dock here next to the centre.

==Climate==

Like much of the rest of Scotland, Edinburgh has a [[temperate]], [[maritime climate]] which is relatively mild despite its northerly [[latitude]].&lt;ref name=&quot;temperature&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/es/ |title=Regional Climate – Eastern Scotland |accessdate=19 April 2009 |publisher=Met Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winters are generally mild, with daytime temperatures rarely falling below freezing, and compare favourably with places such as Moscow, [[Labrador]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] which lie at similar latitudes.&lt;ref name=&quot;temperature&quot;/&gt; Summer temperatures are normally moderate, with daily upper maxima rarely exceeding 22&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;temperature&quot;/&gt; The highest temperature ever recorded in the city was {{convert|31.4|C}} on 4 August 1975&lt;ref name=&quot;temperature&quot;/&gt; at Turnhouse Airport. The lowest temperature recorded in recent years was {{convert|-14.6|C}} during December 2010 at Gogarbank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=December 2010 minimum
|accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proximity of the city to the sea mitigates any large variations in temperature or extremes of climate. Given Edinburgh's position between the coast and hills, it is renowned as a windy city, with the prevailing wind direction coming from the south-west which is associated with warm, unstable air from the [[North Atlantic Current]] that can give rise to rainfall – although considerably less than cities to the west, such as [[Glasgow]].&lt;ref name=&quot;temperature&quot;/&gt; Rainfall is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;temperature&quot;/&gt; Winds from an easterly direction are usually drier but colder, and are usually accompanied by [[Haar (fog)]], a persistent coastal fog. Vigorous Atlantic depressions, known as [[European windstorms]], can affect the city between October and May.&lt;ref name=&quot;temperature&quot;/&gt;

'''Elizabeth II''' (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; born 21 April 1926{{ref|birthday|[note 1]}}) is the [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional]] [[monarch]] of 16 [[sovereign state]]s known as the [[Commonwealth realm]]s, head of the 54-member [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and, in her role as the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]], [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]].

Elizabeth was born in London, and educated privately at home. Her father acceded to the throne as [[George VI]] in 1936 on the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication]] of his brother [[Edward VIII]]. She began to undertake public duties during the [[World War II|Second World War]], in which she served in the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]]. On the death of her father in 1952, she became [[Head of the Commonwealth]] and [[queen regnant]] of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]], and [[Dominion of Ceylon|Ceylon]]. Her [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|coronation service]] in 1953 was the first to be televised. Between 1956 and 1992, the number of her realms varied as territories gained independence and some realms became republics. Today, in addition to the first four aforementioned countries, Elizabeth is Queen of [[Jamaica]], [[Barbados]], [[the Bahamas]], [[Grenada]], [[Papua New Guinea]], the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Tuvalu]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Belize]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], and [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]].

In 1947 she married [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], with whom she has four children: [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles]], [[Anne, Princess Royal|Anne]], [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Andrew]], and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Edward]]. In 1992, which Elizabeth termed her ''{{lang|la|[[annus horribilis]]}}'' (&quot;horrible year&quot;), Charles and Andrew separated from their wives, Anne divorced, and a [[1992 Windsor Castle fire|severe fire]] damaged part of [[Windsor Castle]]. Revelations continued on the state of Charles's marriage to [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], and they divorced in 1996. The following year, [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana died in a Paris car crash]], and the media criticised the royal family for remaining in seclusion in the days before [[Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales|her funeral]].&lt;!--Citations given in &quot;1990s&quot; section below: Bond, p. 134; Brandreth, p. 358; Lacey, pp. 6–7; Pimlott, p. 616; Roberts, p. 98; Shawcross, p. 8--&gt; Elizabeth's personal popularity rebounded after she appeared in public&lt;!--Citations given in &quot;1990s&quot; section below: Bond, p. 134; Brandreth, p. 359; Lacey, pp. 13–15; Pimlott, pp. 623–624--&gt; and has subsequently remained high.&lt;!--e.g. Polls cited in &quot;Public perception and character&quot; section below: Ipsos MORI (2006); Populus Ltd (2007); BBC (2007)--&gt;

Her reign of {{age|1952|2|6}} years is the [[List of longest-reigning British monarchs#Overall|second-longest for a British monarch]]; only [[Queen Victoria]] has reigned longer. Her [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver]] and [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Golden Jubilees]] were celebrated in 1977 and 2002; her [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Diamond Jubilee]] is being celebrated during 2012.

Elizabeth was the first child of Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King [[George VI]]), and his wife, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Elizabeth]]. Her father was the second son of King [[George V]] and Queen [[Mary of Teck|Mary]], and her mother was the youngest daughter of Scottish aristocrat [[Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne]]. She was born by [[Caesarean section]] at 2.40&amp;nbsp;am (GMT) on 21 April 1926 at her maternal grandfather's London house: 17 Bruton Street, [[Mayfair]].&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 22; Brandreth, p. 103; Pimlott, pp. 2–3; Lacey, pp. 75–76; Roberts, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[Archbishop of York]], [[Cosmo Lang]], [[Baptism|baptised]] her in the private chapel of [[Buckingham Palace]] on 29 May.&lt;ref&gt;Hoey, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref|baptism|[note 2]}} She was named Elizabeth after her mother, Alexandra after [[Alexandra of Denmark|George V's mother]], who had died six months earlier, and Mary after her paternal grandmother.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Her close family called her &quot;Lilibet&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pimlott, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; George V cherished his granddaughter, and during his serious illness in 1929 her regular visits were credited in the popular press and by later biographers with raising his spirits and aiding his recovery.&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, p. 56; Nicolson, p. 433; Pimlott, pp. 14–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth's only sibling was [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]], born in 1930. The two princesses were educated at home under the supervision of their mother and their [[governess]], [[Marion Crawford]], who was casually known as &quot;Crawfie&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, p. 26; Pimlott, p. 20; Shawcross, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Lessons concentrated on history, language, literature and music.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, p. 124; Lacey, pp. 62–63; Pimlott, pp. 24, 69&lt;/ref&gt; To the dismay of the royal family,&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, pp. 108–110; Lacey, pp. 159–161; Pimlott, pp. 20, 163&lt;/ref&gt; in 1950 Crawford published a biography of Elizabeth and Margaret's childhood years entitled ''The Little Princesses''. The book describes Elizabeth's love of horses and dogs, her orderliness, and her attitude of responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, pp. 108–110&lt;/ref&gt; Others echoed such observations: [[Winston Churchill]] described Elizabeth when she was two as &quot;a character. She has an air of authority and reflectiveness astonishing in an infant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, p. 105; Lacey, p. 81; Shawcross, pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; Her cousin [[Margaret Rhodes]] described her as &quot;a jolly little girl, but fundamentally sensible and well-behaved&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, pp. 105–106&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heiress presumptive==

As a granddaughter of the monarch in the male line, Elizabeth's full style at birth was ''[[Royal Highness|Her Royal Highness]] [[British princess|Princess]] Elizabeth of York''. She was third in the [[Line of succession to the British throne|line of succession to the throne]], behind her uncle, [[Edward VIII|Edward, Prince of Wales]], and her father. Although her birth generated public interest, she was not expected to become queen, as the Prince of Wales was still young, and many assumed he would marry and have children of his own.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, p. 8; Lacey, p. 76; Pimlott, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, when her grandfather, [[George V]], died and her uncle Edward succeeded, she became second in line to the throne after her father. Later that year, [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|Edward abdicated]] after his proposed marriage to divorced socialite [[Wallis Simpson]] provoked a constitutional crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, pp. 97–98&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth's father became king, and she became [[Heir presumptive|heiress presumptive]], with the style ''Her Royal Highness The Princess Elizabeth''.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{cite journal|last=Assheton|first=Ralph|date=18 December 1936|title=Succession to the Throne|journal=The Times|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; If her parents had had a son, he would have been [[heir apparent]] and above her in the line of succession.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, pp. 78, 85; Pimlott, pp. 71–73&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth received private tuition in constitutional history from [[Henry Marten (educator)|Henry Marten]], [[List of Provosts of Eton College|Vice-Provost]] of [[Eton College]],&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, p. 124; Crawford, p. 85; Lacey, p. 112; Pimlott, p. 51; Shawcross, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; and learned French from a succession of native-speaking governesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Her Majesty The Queen: Education|publisher=Royal Household|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/Education/Overview.aspx|accessdate=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[Girl Guides]] company, the [[Girlguiding London and South East England#1st Buckingham Palace Company|1st Buckingham Palace Company]], was formed specifically so she could socialise with girls her own age.&lt;ref&gt;Pimlott, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Later she was enrolled as a [[Ranger (Girl Guide)|Sea Ranger]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edu&quot;/&gt;

In 1939 Elizabeth's parents [[1939 royal tour of Canada|toured Canada]] and visited the United States. As in 1927, when her parents had toured Australia and New Zealand, Elizabeth remained in Britain as her father thought her too young to undertake public tours.&lt;ref name=p54&gt;Pimlott, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth &quot;looked tearful&quot; as her parents departed.&lt;ref name=p55&gt;Pimlott, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; They corresponded regularly,&lt;ref name=p55/&gt; and on 18 May, she and her parents made the first royal transatlantic telephone call.&lt;ref name=p54/&gt;

===Second World War===
From September 1939, with the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Elizabeth and Margaret stayed at [[Balmoral Castle]], Scotland, until Christmas 1939, when they moved to [[Sandringham House]], [[Norfolk]].&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, pp. 104–114; Pimlott, pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt; From February to May 1940, they lived at [[Royal Lodge]], Windsor, until moving to [[Windsor Castle]], where they stayed for most of the next five years.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, pp. 114–119; Pimlott, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; The suggestion by senior politician [[Douglas Hogg, 1st Viscount Hailsham|Lord Hailsham]]&lt;!--Warwick, Christopher (2002). ''Princess Margaret: A Life of Contrasts''. London: Carlton Publishing Group. ISBN 0233051066, p. 102--&gt; that the two princesses should be [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated]] to Canada was rejected by Elizabeth's mother; she declared, &quot;The children won't go without me. I won't leave without the King. And the King will never leave.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/The%20House%20of%20Windsor%20from%201952/QueenElizabethTheQueenMother/ActivitiesasQueen.aspx|title=Biography of HM Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother: Activities as Queen|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Windsor, the princesses staged [[pantomime]]s at Christmas in aid of the Queen's Wool Fund, which bought yarn to knit into military garments.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, pp. 137–141&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, the 14-year-old Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast during the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Children's Hour]]'', addressing other children who had been evacuated from the cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;CH&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/princesselizabeth/6600.shtml?all=1&amp;id=6600|title=Children's Hour: Princess Elizabeth|publisher=BBC|date=13 October 1940|accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She stated:
{{quote|We are trying to do all we can to help our gallant sailors, soldiers and airmen, and we are trying, too, to bear our share of the danger and sadness of war. We know, every one of us, that in the end all will be well.&lt;ref name=&quot;CH&quot; /&gt;}}

In 1943, at the age of 16, Elizabeth undertook her first solo public appearance on a visit to the [[Grenadier Guards]], of which she had been appointed [[Colonel-in-Chief]] the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/Publiclife/EarlyPublicLife/Earlypubliclife.aspx|title=Early public life|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As she approached her 18th birthday, the law was changed so that she could act as one of five [[Counsellor of State|Counsellors of State]] in the event of her father's incapacity or absence abroad, such as his visit to Italy in July 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Pimlott, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1945, she joined the [[Women's Auxiliary Territorial Service]], as an honorary Second [[Subaltern (rank)|Subaltern]] with the [[service number]] of 230873.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36973|date=6 March 1945|startpage=1315|supp=yes|accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She trained as a driver and mechanic,&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 45; Lacey, p. 148; Pimlott, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; and was promoted to honorary Junior Commander five months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=37205|date=31 July 1945|startpage=3972|supp=yes|accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{British Royal Family}}
During the war, plans were drawn up to quell [[Welsh nationalism]] by affiliating Elizabeth more closely with Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4329001.stm|title=Royal plans to beat nationalism|publisher=BBC|date=8 March 2005|accessdate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welsh politicians proposed that Elizabeth be made [[Prince of Wales|Princess of Wales]] on her 18th birthday. The idea was supported by [[Home Secretary]] [[Herbert Morrison]], but rejected by the King because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales, and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent.&lt;ref&gt;Pimlott, pp. 71–73&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, she was inducted into the Welsh [[Gorsedd]] of Bards at the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/911/|title=Gorsedd of the Bards|publisher=National Museum of Wales|accessdate=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the war in Europe, on [[Victory in Europe Day]], Elizabeth and her sister mingled anonymously with the celebratory crowds in the streets of London. She later said in a rare interview, &quot;we asked my parents if we could go out and see for ourselves. I remember we were terrified of being recognised&amp;nbsp;... I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down [[Whitehall]], all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bond, p. 10; Pimlott, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the princess made her first overseas tour, when she accompanied her parents through southern Africa. During the tour, in a broadcast to the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] on her 21st birthday, she pledged: &quot;I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/ImagesandBroadcasts/Historic%20speeches%20and%20broadcasts/21stbirthdayspeech21April1947.aspx|title=21st birthday speech|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage===
{{see|Wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten, Duke of Edinburgh}}
Elizabeth met her future husband, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark]], in 1934 and 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, pp. 132–139; Lacey, pp. 124–125; Pimlott, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; After another meeting at the [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Royal Naval College in Dartmouth]] in July 1939, Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;– though only 13 years old&amp;nbsp;– fell in love with Philip, and they began to exchange letters.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, p. 10; Brandreth, pp. 132–136, 166–169; Lacey, pp. 119, 126, 135&lt;/ref&gt; They married on 20 November 1947 at [[Westminster Abbey]]. They are [[Cousin|second cousins once removed]] through King [[Christian IX of Denmark]] and third cousins through [[Queen Victoria]]. Before the marriage, Philip renounced his Greek and Danish titles, converted from [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodoxy]] to [[Anglicanism]], and adopted the style ''Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten'', taking [[Mountbatten|the surname of his mother's British family]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoey, pp. 55–56; Pimlott, pp. 101, 137&lt;/ref&gt; Just before the wedding, he was created [[Duke of Edinburgh]] and granted the style of ''His Royal Highness''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=38128|startpage=5495|date=21 November 1947|accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The marriage was not without controversy: Philip had no financial standing, was foreign-born (though a British subject), and had sisters who had married German noblemen with [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] links.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Edwards, Phil|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/R/real_lives/prince_philip_t.html|title=The Real Prince Philip|publisher=Channel 4|date=31 October 2000|accessdate=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marion Crawford wrote, &quot;Some of the King's advisors did not think him good enough for her. He was a prince without a home or kingdom. Some of the papers played long and loud tunes on the string of Philip's foreign origin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth's mother was reported, in later biographies, to have opposed the union initially, even dubbing Philip &quot;[[List of terms used for Germans#Hun (derogatory)|The Hun]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/campaigns/queen80/uqphilip.xml|title=Philip, the one constant through her life|accessdate=23 September 2009|author=Davies, Caroline|date=20 April 2006|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later life, however, she told biographer [[Tim Heald]] that Philip was &quot;an English gentleman&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Heald, p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth and Philip received 2500 wedding gifts from around the world,&lt;ref name=&quot;news1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Factfiles/60diamondweddinganniversaryfacts.aspx|title=60 Diamond Wedding anniversary facts|publisher=Royal Household|date=18 November 2007|accessdate=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Britain had not yet completely rebounded from the devastation of the war. Elizabeth still required [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|ration coupons]] to buy the material for [[Wedding dress of Princess Elizabeth|her gown]], designed by [[Norman Hartnell]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoey, p. 58; Pimlott, pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt; In post-war Britain, it was not acceptable for the Duke of Edinburgh's German relations to be invited to the wedding, including Philip's three surviving sisters.&lt;ref&gt;Hoey, p. 59; Petropoulos, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward VIII|Edward]], the former king, was not invited either.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth gave birth to her first child, [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], on 14 November 1948, less than one month after [[letters patent]] were issued by her father allowing her children to use the style and title of a royal prince or princess. They otherwise would not have been entitled to such a status as their father was no longer a royal prince.&lt;ref&gt;Letters Patent, 22 October 1948; Hoey, pp. 69–70; Pimlott, pp. 155–156&lt;/ref&gt; A second child, [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]], was born in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Pimlott, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

Following their wedding, the couple leased [[Windlesham Moor]] near [[Windsor Castle]], until 4 July 1949,&lt;ref name=&quot;news1&quot;/&gt; when they took up residence at [[Clarence House]] in London. At various times between 1949 and 1951, the Duke of Edinburgh was stationed in the British [[Protectorate]] of [[Malta]] as a serving [[Royal Navy]] officer. He and Elizabeth lived intermittently, for several months at a time, in the Maltese hamlet of [[Gwardamanġia]], at the Villa Gwardamanġia, the rented home of Philip's uncle, [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]]. The children remained in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, pp. 226–238; Pimlott, pp. 145, 159–163, 167&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reign==
===Accession and coronation===
[[George VI]]'s health declined during 1951, and Elizabeth was soon frequently standing in for him at public events. In October of that year, she toured Canada, and visited [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]; on the trip, her private secretary, [[Martin Charteris, Baron Charteris of Amisfield|Martin Charteris]], carried a draft accession declaration for use if the King died while she was on tour.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, pp. 240–241; Lacey, p. 166; Pimlott, pp. 169–172&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1952, Elizabeth and Philip set out for a tour of Australia and New Zealand by way of [[Kenya]]. On 6 February 1952, they had just returned to their Kenyan home, [[Sagana Lodge]], after a night spent at [[Treetops Hotel]], when word arrived of the death of Elizabeth's father. Philip broke the news to the new queen.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, pp. 245–247; Lacey, p. 166; Pimlott, pp. 173–176; Shawcross, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Charteris asked her to choose a [[regnal name]]; she chose to remain Elizabeth, &quot;of course&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bousfield and Toffoli, p. 72; Charteris quoted in Pimlott, p. 179 and Shawcross, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; She was [[Proclamation of accession of Elizabeth II|proclaimed queen]] throughout her realms, and the royal party hastily returned to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Pimlott, pp. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt; She and the Duke of Edinburgh moved into [[Buckingham Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;Pimlott, pp. 186–187&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Elizabeth and Philip 1953.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Elizabeth in crown and robes next to her husband in military uniform|Coronation portrait of Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh, June 1953]]

With Elizabeth's accession it seemed likely that the [[royal house]] would bear her husband's name. Lord Mountbatten thought it would be the ''House of Mountbatten'', as Elizabeth would typically have taken Philip's last name on marriage; however Elizabeth's grandmother [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] favoured the retention of the [[House of Windsor]], and so Windsor it remained. The Duke complained, &quot;I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 80; Brandreth, pp. 253–254; Lacey, pp. 172–173; Pimlott, pp. 183–185&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Queen Mary on 24 March 1953 and the resignation of Churchill in 1955, the surname ''[[Mountbatten-Windsor]]'' was adopted in 1960 for Philip and Elizabeth's male-line descendants who do not carry royal titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=41948|supp=yes|startpage=1003|date=5 February 1960|accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amid preparations for the [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]], [[Princess Margaret]] informed her sister that she wished to marry [[Peter Townsend (RAF officer)|Peter Townsend]], a divorced [[Commoners in the United Kingdom|commoner]] 16 years older than Margaret with two sons from his previous marriage. The Queen asked them to wait for a year; in the words of Martin Charteris, &quot;the Queen was naturally sympathetic towards the Princess, but I think she thought&amp;nbsp;– she hoped&amp;nbsp;– given time, the affair would peter out.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, pp. 269–271&lt;/ref&gt; Senior politicians were against the match, and the [[Church of England]] did not permit re-marriage after divorce. If Margaret contracted a civil marriage, she would have to renounce her right of succession.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, pp. 269–271; Lacey, pp. 193–194; Pimlott, pp. 201, 236–238&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, she decided to abandon her plans with Townsend.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, p. 22; Brandreth, p. 271; Lacey, p. 194; Pimlott, p. 238; Shawcross, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, she married [[Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon|Antony Armstrong-Jones]], who was created [[Earl of Snowdon]] the following year. They were divorced in 1978. She did not remarry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/The%20House%20of%20Windsor%20from%201952/HRHPrincessMargaret/Marriageandfamily.aspx|title=Princess Margaret: Marriage and family|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the death of Queen Mary ten weeks before, the [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|coronation]] went ahead on 2 June 1953. Before she died, Mary had asked that the coronation not be delayed.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony in [[Westminster Abbey]], except the [[anointing]] and [[Eucharist|communion]], was televised for the first time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Pressreleases/2003/50factsaboutTheQueensCoronation.aspx|title=50 facts about The Queen's Coronation|date=25 May 2003|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the coverage was instrumental in boosting the medium's popularity; the number of [[Television licensing in the United Kingdom|television licences in the United Kingdom]] doubled to 3&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref&gt;Pimlott, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; and many of the more than 20&amp;nbsp;million British viewers watched television for the first time in the homes of their friends or neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, pp. 420 ff.; Pimlott, p. 207; Roberts, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, just under 100 million viewers watched recorded broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coronation gown of Elizabeth II|Elizabeth's coronation gown]] was commissioned from [[Norman Hartnell]] and embroidered on her instructions with the floral emblems of Commonwealth countries:&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, p. 190; Pimlott, pp. 247–248&lt;/ref&gt; English [[Tudor rose]], Scots [[thistle]], Welsh [[leek]], Irish [[shamrock]], Australian [[Acacia pycnantha|wattle]], Canadian [[maple leaf]], New Zealand [[Cyathea dealbata|silver fern]], South African [[protea]], [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus flowers]] for India and Ceylon, and Pakistan's [[wheat]], [[cotton]], and [[jute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cotton, Belinda; Ramsey, Ron|url=http://www.nga.gov.au/ByAppointment/|title=By appointment: Norman Hartnell's sample for the Coronation dress of Queen Elizabeth II|publisher=National Gallery of Australia|accessdate=4 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth witnessed, over her life, the ongoing transformation of the [[British Empire]] into the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. By the time of Elizabeth's accession in 1952, her role as nominal head of multiple independent states was already established.&lt;ref&gt;Pimlott, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; Spanning 1953–54, the Queen and her husband embarked on a six-month around-the-world tour.

In 1956, [[Prime Minister of France|French Prime Minister]] [[Guy Mollet]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] Sir [[Anthony Eden]] discussed the possibility of France joining the Commonwealth. The proposal was never accepted, and the following year France signed the [[Treaty of Rome]], which established the [[European Economic Community]], the precursor of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6261885.stm|title=When Britain and France nearly married|publisher=BBC|date=15 January 2007|accessdate=14 December 2009|first=Mike|last=Thomson}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1956, Britain and France invaded [[Egypt]] in an [[Suez Crisis|ultimately unsuccessful attempt]] to capture the [[Suez Canal]]. [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] claimed the Queen was opposed to the invasion, though Eden denied it. Eden resigned two months later.&lt;ref&gt;Pimlott, p. 255; Roberts, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of a formal mechanism within the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] for choosing a leader meant that, following Eden's resignation, it fell to the Queen to decide whom to [[Kissing Hands|commission to form a government]]. Eden recommended that she consult [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 5th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] (the [[Lord President of the Council]]). Lord Salisbury and [[David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir|Lord Kilmuir]] (the [[Lord Chancellor]]) consulted the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]], [[Winston Churchill]], and the Chairman of the backbench [[1922 Committee]], as a result of which the Queen appointed their recommended candidate: [[Harold Macmillan]].&lt;ref&gt;Marr, pp. 175–176; Pimlott, pp. 256–260; Roberts, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

The Suez crisis and the choice of Eden's successor led in 1957 to the first major personal criticism of the Queen. In a magazine, which he owned and edited,&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, p. 199; Shawcross, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Grigg (writer)|Lord Altrincham]] accused her of being &quot;out of touch&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Altrincham in ''[[National Review (London)|National Review]]'' quoted by Brandreth, p. 374 and Roberts, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Altrincham was denounced by public figures and physically attacked by a member of the public appalled at his comments.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, p. 374; Pimlott, pp. 280–281; Shawcross, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Six years later in 1963, Macmillan resigned and advised the Queen to appoint [[Alec Douglas-Home|the Earl of Home]] as prime minister, advice that she followed.&lt;ref name=r84&gt;Hardman, p. 22; Pimlott, pp. 324–335; Roberts, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen again came under criticism for appointing the Prime Minister on the advice of a small number of ministers, or a single minister.&lt;ref name=r84/&gt; In 1965, the Conservatives adopted a formal mechanism for choosing a leader, thus relieving her of involvement.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Wikisource|Queen Elizabeth II's Address to the United Nations General Assembly}}

In 1957, she made a state visit to the United States, where she addressed the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. On the same tour, she opened the [[23rd Canadian Parliament]], becoming the first [[Monarchy of Canada|monarch of Canada]] to open a parliamentary session.&lt;ref name=Canada&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/Canada/Royalvisits.aspx|title=Queen and Canada: Royal visits|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, she revisited the United States as a representative of Canada.&lt;ref name=Canada/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, she toured Cyprus, India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Pimlott, p. 303; Shawcross, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; On a visit to [[Ghana]] the same year, she dismissed fears for her safety, even though her host [[Heads of state of Ghana|President]] [[Kwame Nkrumah]], who had replaced her as head of state, was a target for assassins.&lt;ref name=mac/&gt; Harold Macmillan wrote: &quot;The Queen has been absolutely determined all through&amp;nbsp;... She is impatient of the attitude towards her to treat her as&amp;nbsp;... a film star&amp;nbsp;... She has indeed '[[Speech to the Troops at Tilbury|the heart and stomach of a man]]'&amp;nbsp;... She loves her duty and means to be a Queen.&quot;&lt;ref name=mac&gt;Macmillan, pp. 466–472&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth's pregnancies with Princes [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Andrew]] and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Edward]] in 1959 and 1963, respectively, mark the only times she has not performed the [[State Opening of Parliament|State Opening of the British parliament]] during her reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dymond, Glenn|date=5 March 2010|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/documents/upload/lln2010-007.pdf|title=Ceremonial in the House of Lords|publisher=House of Lords Library|page=12|accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to performing traditional ceremonies, she also instituted new practices. Her first royal walkabout, meeting ordinary members of the public, took place during a tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/Publiclife/PublicLife1962-1971/1962-1971.aspx|title=Public life 1962–1971|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s and 1970s saw an acceleration in the [[decolonisation]] of Africa and [[the Caribbean]]. Over 20 countries gained independence from Britain as part of a planned transition to self-government. In 1965, however, [[Rhodesia]]n Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]] [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|declared unilateral independence]] in opposition to moves toward majority black rule. Although the Queen dismissed Smith in a formal declaration and the international community applied sanctions against Rhodesia, Smith's regime survived for over a decade.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, p. 66; Pimlott, pp. 345–354&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1974, British Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] called a [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|general election]] in the middle of the Queen's tour of the [[Austronesia]]n [[Pacific Rim]] and she had to fly back to Britain, interrupting the tour.&lt;ref&gt;Pimlott, p. 418&lt;/ref&gt; The inconclusive result of the election meant that Heath, whose Conservative party had the largest share of the popular vote but no overall majority, could stay in office if he formed a coalition with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]]. Heath only resigned when discussions on forming a cooperative government foundered, after which the Queen asked the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]], [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour's]] [[Harold Wilson]], to form a government.&lt;ref&gt;Pimlott, p. 419; Shawcross, pp. 109–110&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, at the height of the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]], [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian Prime Minister]] [[Gough Whitlam]] was dismissed from his post by [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] Sir [[John Kerr (Governor-General)|John Kerr]] after the Opposition-controlled [[Australian Senate|Senate]] rejected Whitlam's budget proposals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aus&quot;&gt;Bond, p. 96; Pimlott, p. 427; Shawcross, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; As Whitlam had a majority in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], [[Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Gordon Scholes]] appealed to the Queen to reverse Kerr's decision. Elizabeth declined, stating that she would not interfere in decisions reserved by the [[constitution of Australia]] for the governor-general.&lt;ref&gt;Pimlott, pp. 428–429&lt;/ref&gt; The crisis fuelled [[Republicanism in Australia|Australian republicanism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Aus&quot;/&gt;

===Silver Jubilee===
In 1977, Elizabeth marked [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|the Silver Jubilee of her accession]]. Parties and events took place throughout the Commonwealth, many coinciding with the [[List of events during the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Queen's associated national and Commonwealth tours]]. The celebrations re-affirmed the Queen's popularity, despite virtually coincident negative press coverage of Princess Margaret's separation from her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Pimlott, p. 449&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, Elizabeth endured a state visit to the United Kingdom by [[Romania]]'s communist dictator [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]], and his wife [[Elena Ceauşescu|Elena]],&lt;ref&gt;Hardman, p. 137; Roberts, pp. 88–89; Shawcross, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; though privately she thought they had &quot;blood on their hands&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth to her staff, quoted in Shawcross, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; The following year brought two blows: one was the unmasking of [[Anthony Blunt]], former [[Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures]], as a communist spy; the other was the assassination of her relative and in-law [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Pimlott, pp. 336–337, 470–471; Roberts, pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Paul Joseph James Martin|Paul Martin, Sr.]], by the end of the 1970s the Queen was worried the Crown &quot;had little meaning for&quot; [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]].&lt;ref name=Post /&gt; [[Tony Benn]] said that the Queen found Trudeau &quot;rather disappointing&quot;.&lt;ref name=Post&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heinricks|first=Geoff|title=Trudeau: A drawer monarchist|journal=[[National Post]]|date=29 September 2000|page=B12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trudeau's supposed republicanism seemed to be confirmed by his antics, such as sliding down banisters at Buckingham Palace and pirouetting behind the Queen's back in 1977, and the removal of various [[Canadian royal symbols]] during his term of office.&lt;ref name=Post /&gt; In 1980, Canadian politicians sent to London to discuss the [[patriation]] of the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]] found the Queen &quot;better informed on&amp;nbsp;... Canada's constitutional case than any of the British politicians or bureaucrats&quot;.&lt;ref name=Post/&gt; She was interested in the constitutional debate after the failure of Bill C-60, which would have affected her role as [[head of state]].&lt;ref name=Post/&gt; Patriation removed the role of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]] in the Canadian constitution, but the monarchy was retained. Trudeau said in his memoirs: &quot;The Queen favoured my attempt to reform the Constitution. I was always impressed not only by the grace she displayed in public at all times, but by the wisdom she showed in private conversation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Trudeau, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
[[File:ElizabethIItroopingcolour crop.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Elizabeth in red uniform on a black horse|Elizabeth riding [[Burmese (horse)|Burmese]] at a Trooping the Colour ceremony]]
During the 1981 [[Trooping the Colour]] ceremony, and only six weeks before the [[wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer]], six shots were fired at the Queen from close range as she rode down [[The Mall (London)|The Mall]] on her horse, [[Burmese (horse)|Burmese]]. Police later discovered that the shots were blanks. The 17-year-old assailant, [[Marcus Sarjeant]], was sentenced to five years in prison and released after three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/14/newsid_2516000/2516713.stm|title=Queen's 'fantasy assassin' jailed|publisher=BBC|accessdate=21 June 2010|date=14 September 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen's composure and skill in controlling her mount were widely praised.&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, p. 281; Pimlott, pp. 476–477; Shawcross, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the Queen awoke in her bedroom at Buckingham Palace to find an intruder, [[Michael Fagan incident|Michael Fagan]], in the room with her. Remaining calm, and through two calls to the palace police switchboard, the Queen spoke to Fagan while he sat at the foot of her bed until assistance arrived seven minutes later.&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, pp. 297–298; Pimlott, p. 491&lt;/ref&gt; From April to September that year, the Queen remained anxious&lt;ref&gt;Bond, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; but proud&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; of her son, Prince Andrew, who was serving with British forces during the [[Falklands War]]. Though she hosted President [[Ronald Reagan]] at Windsor Castle in 1982, and visited [[Rancho del Cielo|his Californian ranch]] in 1983, she was angered when his administration ordered the [[invasion of Grenada]], one of her Caribbean realms, without her foreknowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, p. 188; Pimlott, p. 497&lt;/ref&gt;

Intense media interest in the opinions and private lives of the royal family during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, not all of which were entirely true.&lt;ref&gt;Pimlott, pp. 488–490&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Kelvin MacKenzie]], editor of ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'', told his staff: &quot;Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not true&amp;nbsp;– so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pimlott, p. 521&lt;/ref&gt; Newspaper editor [[Donald Trelford]] wrote in ''[[The Observer]]'' of 21 September 1986: &quot;The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of&amp;nbsp;... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not.&quot; It was reported, most notably in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' of 20 July 1986, that Elizabeth was worried that [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s economic policies fostered social divisions, and was alarmed by high unemployment, [[1981 England riots|a series of riots]], the violence of a [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)|miners' strike]], and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the [[apartheid]] regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide [[Michael Shea (diplomat)|Michael Shea]] and [[Commonwealth Secretary-General]] [[Shridath Ramphal]], but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation.&lt;ref&gt;Pimlott, pp. 503–515; see also Neil, pp. 195–207 and Shawcross, pp. 129–132&lt;/ref&gt; Thatcher reputedly said the Queen would vote for the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]]—Thatcher's political opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Thatcher to [[Brian Walden]] quoted in Neil, p. 207; [[Andrew Neil]] quoted in [[Woodrow Wyatt]]'s diary of 26 October 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Thatcher's biographer [[John Campbell (biographer)|John Campbell]] claimed &quot;...&amp;nbsp;the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 467&lt;/ref&gt; Belying reports of acrimony between them, Thatcher later conveyed her personal admiration for the Queen,&lt;ref&gt;Thatcher, p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; and after Thatcher's replacement by [[John Major]], Elizabeth gave two honours in her personal gift to Thatcher: appointment to the [[Order of Merit (Commonwealth)|Order of Merit]] and the [[Order of the Garter]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p. 101; Shawcross, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the elected [[Fiji]]an government was deposed in [[1987 Fijian coups d'état|a military coup]]. Elizabeth, as head of state, supported the attempts of the [[Governor-General of Fiji|Governor-General]], ''Ratu'' Sir [[Penaia Ganilau]], to assert executive power and negotiate a settlement. Coup leader [[Sitiveni Rabuka]] deposed Ganilau, abolished the [[Monarchy of Fiji|monarchy]], and declared Fiji a republic.&lt;ref&gt;Pimlott, pp. 515–516&lt;/ref&gt; By the start of 1991, republican feeling in Britain had risen because of press estimates of the Queen's private wealth, which were contradicted by the palace, and reports of affairs and strained marriages among her extended family.&lt;ref&gt;Pimlott, pp. 519–534&lt;/ref&gt; The involvement of the younger royals in the charity game show ''[[It's a Royal Knockout]]'' was ridiculed,&lt;ref&gt;Hardman, p. 81; Lacey, p. 307; Pimlott, pp. 522–526&lt;/ref&gt; and the Queen was the target of satire.&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, pp. 293–294; Pimlott, p. 541&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
In 1991, in the wake of victory in the [[Gulf War]], Elizabeth became the first British monarch to address a joint session of the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Pimlott, p. 538&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, she attempted to save the failing marriage of her eldest son, [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles]], by counselling him and his wife, [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], to reconcile.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, p. 349; Lacey, p. 319&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech on 24 November 1992, to mark the 40th anniversary of her accession, the Queen called 1992 her ''[[annus horribilis]]'', meaning ''horrible year''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/ImagesandBroadcasts/Historic%20speeches%20and%20broadcasts/Annushorribilisspeech24November1992.aspx|title=Annus horribilis speech, 24 November 1992|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, her second son [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]], and his wife [[Sarah, Duchess of York]], separated. In April, her daughter [[Anne, Princess Royal]], divorced her husband Captain [[Mark Phillips]].&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, p. 319; Pimlott, pp. 550–551&lt;/ref&gt; During a state visit to Germany in October, angry demonstrators in [[Dresden]] threw eggs at her,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stanglin, Doug|title=German study concludes 25,000 died in Allied bombing of Dresden|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2010/03/official-german-study-concludes-25000-died-in-allied-bombing-of-dresden/1?csp=34|work=USA Today|date=18 March 2010|accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in November Windsor Castle [[1992 Windsor Castle fire|suffered severe fire damage]]. The monarchy received increased criticism and public scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, p. 377; Pimlott, pp. 558–559; Roberts, p. 94; Shawcross, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; In an unusually personal speech, Elizabeth said that any institution must expect criticism, but suggested it be done with &quot;a touch of humour, gentleness and understanding&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, Prime Minister [[John Major]] announced reforms of the royal finances that had been planned since the previous year, including the Queen paying [[income tax]] for the first time, starting in 1993, and a reduction in the [[civil list]].&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, pp. 325–326; Pimlott, pp. 559–561&lt;/ref&gt; In December, Charles and Diana formally separated.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 226; Hardman, p. 96; Lacey, p. 328; Pimlott, p. 561&lt;/ref&gt; The year ended with a lawsuit as the Queen sued ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' newspaper for breach of copyright when it published the text of her [[Royal Christmas Message|annual Christmas message]] two days before its broadcast. The newspaper was forced to pay her legal fees, and donated £200,000 to charity.&lt;ref&gt;Pimlott, p. 562&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ensuing years, public revelations on the state of Charles and Diana's marriage continued.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, p. 356; Pimlott, pp. 572–577; Roberts, p. 94; Shawcross, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Even though support for a British republic seemed higher than at any time in living memory, republicanism remained a minority viewpoint and Elizabeth herself had high approval ratings.&lt;ref&gt;MORI poll for ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper, March 1996, quoted in Pimlott, p. 578 and {{cite news|author=O'Sullivan, Jack|date=5 March 1996|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/watch-out-the-roundheads-are-back-1340396.html|title=Watch out, the Roundheads are back|work=The Independent|accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism was focused on the institution of monarchy itself and the Queen's wider family rather than the Queen's own behaviour and actions.&lt;ref&gt;Pimlott, p. 578&lt;/ref&gt; In consultation with Prime Minister Major, [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[George Carey]], her private secretary [[Robert Fellowes, Baron Fellowes|Robert Fellowes]], and her husband, she wrote to Charles and Diana at the end of December 1995, saying that a divorce was desirable.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, p. 357; Pimlott, p. 577&lt;/ref&gt; A year after the divorce, which took place in 1996, [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris]] on 31 August 1997. The Queen was on holiday with her son and grandchildren at [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]]. Diana's two sons wanted to attend church, and so the Queen and Prince Philip took them that morning.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, p. 358; Hardman, p. 101; Pimlott, p. 610&lt;/ref&gt; After that single public appearance, for five days the Queen and the Duke shielded their grandsons from the intense press interest by keeping them at Balmoral where they could grieve in private.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, p. 134; Brandreth, p. 358; Pimlott, p. 615&lt;/ref&gt; The royal family's seclusion caused public dismay.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, p. 134; Brandreth, p. 358; Lacey, pp. 6–7; Pimlott, p. 616; Roberts, p. 98; Shawcross, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Pressured by the hostile reaction, the Queen agreed to a live broadcast to the world, the day before [[Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana's funeral]] and returned to London to deliver it on 5 September.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, pp. 358–359; Lacey, pp. 8–9; Pimlott, pp. 621–622&lt;/ref&gt; In the broadcast, she expressed admiration for Diana, and her feelings &quot;as a grandmother&quot; for Princes [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|William]] and [[Prince Harry of Wales|Harry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;b&amp;b&quot;&gt;Bond, p. 134; Brandreth, p. 359; Lacey, pp. 13–15; Pimlott, pp. 623–624&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, much of the public hostility evaporated.&lt;ref name=&quot;b&amp;b&quot;/&gt;

In 2002, Elizabeth marked [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|her Golden Jubilee as queen]]. Her sister and mother died in February and March, respectively, and the media speculated as to whether the Jubilee would be a success or a failure.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; She again undertook an extensive tour of her realms, which began in Jamaica in February, where she called the farewell banquet &quot;memorable&quot; after a power cut plunged the [[King's House, Jamaica|King's House]], the official residence of the [[Governor-General of Jamaica|Governor-General]], into darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Brandreth, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; As in 1977, there were street parties and commemorative events, and monuments were named to honour the occasion. A million people attended each day of the three-day main Jubilee celebration in London,&lt;ref&gt;Bond, pp. 166–167&lt;/ref&gt; and the enthusiasm shown by the public for Elizabeth was greater than many journalists had predicted.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

Though generally healthy throughout her life, in 2003 she had [[keyhole surgery]] on both knees, and in June 2005 she cancelled several engagements after contracting a bad cold. In October 2006, she missed the opening of the new [[Emirates Stadium]] because of a strained back muscle that had been troubling her since the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6087724.stm|title=Queen cancels visit due to injury|publisher=BBC|date=26 October 2006|accessdate=8 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, she was seen in public with a [[Adhesive bandage|bandage]] on her right hand, which led to press speculation of ill health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-420950/Plaster-Queens-hand-minor-cut-IV-drip.html|title=Plaster on Queen's hand: minor cut or IV drip?|author=Greenhill, Sam; Hope, Jenny|work=Daily Mail|date=6 December 2006|accessdate=8 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had been bitten by one of her [[Pembroke Welsh Corgi|corgi]]s while she was separating two that were fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article75313.ece|title=Corgi put the queen in plaster|author=Whittaker, Thomas|work=The Sun|date=14 December 2006|accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper reported claims from unnamed sources that the Queen was &quot;exasperated and frustrated&quot; by the policies of British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], that she had shown concern that the [[British Armed Forces]] were overstretched in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]], and that she had raised concerns over rural and countryside issues with Blair repeatedly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1552769/Revealed-Queens-dismay-at-Blair-legacy.html|author=Alderson, Andrew|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Revealed: Queen's dismay at Blair legacy|date=28 May 2007|accessdate=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was, however, said to admire Blair's efforts to achieve peace in [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/05/27/nqueen127.xml|author=Alderson, Andrew|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Tony and Her Majesty: an uneasy relationship|date=27 May 2007|accessdate=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 March 2008, at the [[Church of Ireland]] [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh (Church of Ireland)|St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh]], the Queen attended the first [[Royal Maundy|Maundy service]] held outside of England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7305675.stm |title=Historic first for Maundy service|publisher=BBC|date=20 March 2008|accessdate=12 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the invitation of Irish President [[Mary McAleese]], in May 2011 the Queen made the first [[Queen Elizabeth II's visit to the Republic of Ireland|state visit to the Republic of Ireland]] by a British monarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-us/what-we-do/public-diplomacy/state-visit-ireland-2011|title=Queen's State Visit to Ireland 2011|publisher=Foreign and Commonwealth Office|accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Queen's visit to Australia in October 2011, her 16th visit since 1954, was called her &quot;farewell tour&quot; in the press because of her age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal tour of Australia: The Queen ends visit with traditional 'Aussie barbie'|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/queen-elizabeth-II/8857106/Royal-tour-of-Australia-The-Queen-ends-visit-with-traditional-Aussie-barbie.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=29 October 2011|accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth plans to celebrate her [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Diamond Jubilee]] in 2012, marking 60 years as Queen.

==Public perception and character==
{{Main|Personality and image of Queen Elizabeth II}}
Since Elizabeth rarely gives interviews, little is known of her personal feelings. As a [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarch]], she has not expressed her own political opinions in a public forum. She does have a deep sense of religious and civic duty, and takes her coronation oath seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4921120.stm|title=Queen 'will do her job for life'|publisher=BBC|date=19 April 2006|accessdate=4 February 2007}}&lt;br /&gt;Shawcross, pp. 194–195&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from her [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom#Religious role|official religious role]] as [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Governor]] of the [[State religion|established]] [[Church of England]], she personally worships with that church and with the national [[Church of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/about_us/how_we_are_organised|title=How we are organised|publisher=Church of Scotland|accessdate=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has demonstrated support for [[Interfaith|inter-faith]] relations, and has met with leaders of other religions, and granted her personal [[patronage]] to [[the Council of Christians and Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccj.org.uk/Presidents-and-Vice-Presidents|title=Presidents, Vice Presidents and Trustees|publisher=Council of Christians and Jews|accessdate=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A personal note about her faith often features in her annual [[Royal Christmas Message]] broadcast to the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], such as in 2000, when she spoke about the theological significance of the [[millennium]] marking the 2000th anniversary of the birth of [[Jesus Christ]]:

{{quote|To many of us, our beliefs are of fundamental importance. For me the teachings of Christ and my own personal accountability before God provide a framework in which I try to lead my life.

Elizabeth is the patron of over 600 charities and other organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/QueenCharities/Overview.aspx|title=Queen and Charities|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her main leisure interests include [[equestrianism]] and dogs, especially her [[Pembroke Welsh Corgi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=80 facts about The Queen|publisher=Royal Household|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Factfiles/80factsaboutTheQueen.aspx|accessdate=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her clothes consist mostly of solid-colour overcoats and decorative hats, which allow her to be seen easily in a crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jess|last=Cartner-Morley|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,2076067,00.html|title=Elizabeth II, belated follower of fashion|date=10 May 2007|accessdate=5 September 2011|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, as a young woman at the start of her reign, Elizabeth was depicted as a glamorous &quot;fairytale Queen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; After the trauma of the war, it was a time of hope, a period of progress and achievement heralding a &quot;new Elizabethan age&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, p. 35; Pimlott, p. 180; Roberts, p. 82; Shawcross, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Grigg, 2nd Baron Altrincham|Lord Altrincham]]'s accusation in 1957 that her speeches sounded like those of a &quot;priggish schoolgirl&quot; was an extremely rare criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, p. 35; Pimlott, p. 280; Shawcross, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s, attempts to portray a more modern image of monarchy were made in the television documentary ''[[Royal Family (documentary)|Royal Family]]'', and by televising Prince Charles's [[Investiture of the Prince of Wales|investiture as Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;Bond, pp. 66–67, 84, 87–89; Bradford, pp. 160–163; Hardman, pp. 22, 210–213; Lacey, pp. 222–226; Marr, p. 237; Pimlott, pp. 378–392; Roberts, pp. 84–86&lt;/ref&gt;

At her [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver Jubilee]] in 1977, the crowds and celebrations were genuinely enthusiastic,&lt;ref&gt;Bond, p. 97; Pimlott, pp. 449–450; Roberts, p. 87; Shawcross, pp. 114–117&lt;/ref&gt; but in the 1980s public criticism of the royal family increased, as the personal and working lives of Elizabeth's children came under media scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, p. 117; Roberts, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth's popularity sank to a low point in the 1990s. Under pressure from public opinion, she began to pay income tax for the first time, and Buckingham Palace was opened to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, p. 134; Pimlott, pp. 556–561, 570&lt;/ref&gt; Discontent with the monarchy reached its peak on the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]], though the Queen's popularity rebounded after her live broadcast to the world five days after Diana's death.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, p. 134; Pimlott, pp. 624–625&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1999, a [[Australian republic referendum, 1999|referendum in Australia]] on the future of the [[Monarchy of Australia|Australian monarchy]] favoured its retention in preference to an indirectly elected head of state.&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, p. 387; Roberts, p. 101; Shawcross, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Polls in Britain in 2006 and 2007 revealed strong support for Elizabeth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=378|title=Monarchy poll|date=April 2006|publisher=Ipsos MORI|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=http://populuslimited.com/uploads/download_pdf-160108-The-Discovery-Channel-Monarchy-Survey.pdf|format=PDF|title=Monarchy Survey|publisher=Populus Ltd|page=9|date=14–16 December 2007|accessdate=17 August 2010}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7162649.stm|title=Poll respondents back UK monarchy|publisher=BBC|date=28 December 2007|accessdate=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and referendums in [[Tuvaluan constitutional referendum, 2008|Tuvalu in 2008]] and [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines constitutional referendum, 2009|Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in 2009]] both rejected proposals to become republics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2009/11/091126_nib.shtml|title=Vincies vote &quot;No&quot;|publisher=BBC|date=26 November 2009|accessdate=26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Titles and styles===
{{Main|List of titles and honours of Queen Elizabeth II}}
Elizabeth has held titles throughout her life, as a granddaughter of the monarch, as a daughter of the monarch, through her husband's titles, and eventually as Sovereign. In common parlance, she is ''The Queen'' or ''Her Majesty''. Officially, she has a distinct title in each of her realms: [[Queen of Canada]] in Canada, [[Queen of Australia]] in Australia, etc. In the [[Channel Islands]] and [[Isle of Man]], which are [[Crown dependencies]] rather than separate realms, she is known as [[Duke of Normandy]] and [[Lord of Mann]] respectively. Additional styles include [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]] and [[Duke of Lancaster]]. When in conversation with the Queen, the practice is to initially address her as ''Your Majesty'' and thereafter as ''Ma'am''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/GreetingamemberofTheRoyalFamily/Overview.aspx|title=Greeting a member of The Royal Family|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=21 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has received [[List of titles and honours of Queen Elizabeth II|honours and awards]] from around the world, and has held honorary military positions throughout the Commonwealth, both before and after her accession.

===Arms===
{{See also|Flags of Elizabeth II}}
From 21 April 1944, Elizabeth's arms consisted of a [[Lozenge (heraldry)|lozenge]] bearing the [[royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]], differenced with a [[Label (heraldry)|label]] of three points [[argent]], the centre point bearing a [[Tudor rose]] and the first and third a [[St George's Cross|cross of St. George]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ltgov.bc.ca/govhouse/heraldry.htm|title=Heraldry Traditions|publisher=Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia|year=2007|accessdate=21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her accession as Sovereign, she adopted the royal coat of arms undifferenced. The design of the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] is also used on the [[Royal Standard of the United Kingdom]]. Elizabeth has personal flags for use in [[Queen's Personal Canadian Flag|Canada]], [[Queen's Personal Australian Flag|Australia]], [[Queen's Personal Flag for New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Queen's Personal Jamaican Flag|Jamaica]], [[Queen's Personal Barbadian Flag|Barbados]], and [[Personal Flag of Queen Elizabeth II|elsewhere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/Personalflags.aspx|title=Personal flags|publisher=Royal Household|accessdate=21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frank Gordon Dobson''', (born 15 March 1940) is a [[British people|British]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[politician]] who has been the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Holborn and St Pancras (UK Parliament constituency)|Holborn and St. Pancras]] since [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979]]. He served in the [[Blair Ministry|Cabinet]] as [[Secretary of State for Health]] from 1997 to 1999, and was the official Labour Party candidate for [[Mayor of London]] in 2000, ultimately finishing third in [[London mayoral election, 2000|the election]], behind [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Steven Norris]] and winner [[Ken Livingstone]].

==Early life==
Dobson's father was a railwayman. Dobson was born in [[York]], England where he attended [[Dunnington]] County Church of England Primary School and the Archbishop Holgate Grammar School (which became [[Archbishop Holgate's School]] in 1985). He then studied Economics at the [[London School of Economics]], gaining a [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] in 1962. He worked at the headquarters of the [[CEGB|Central Electricity Generating Board]] from 1962 to 1970 and for the [[Electricity Council]] from 1970 to 1975. From 1975 to 1979, he was Assistant Secretary of the Office of the Local Ombudsman. After fighting for a seat on [[Camden London Borough Council]] in 1964, he was elected in 1971 and was chosen as Labour Group Leader (and therefore Leader of the Council) after the resignation of [[Millie Miller]] in 1973.

==Member of Parliament==
He stood down as Leader in 1975 and resigned from the Council on taking up a non-partisan job as Assistant Secretary of the Office of the Local Ombudsman. In 1979 he was elected as MP for [[Holborn and St Pancras South (UK Parliament constituency)|Holborn and St Pancras South]] (later [[Holborn and St. Pancras (UK Parliament constituency)|Holborn and St. Pancras]]). His naturally pugnacious style of politics earned him rapid promotion to the front bench where he served in several important posts from 1982; his liking for 'dirty jokes' and conviviality won him many friends. As Spokesman on Environment and London from 1994 he led the national Labour response to the series of scandals over [[City of Westminster]] council and its former leader [[Shirley Porter]].

===In government===
When Labour won power in 1997, Dobson was appointed as [[Secretary of State for Health]]. This was a high-profile post but Dobson made no significant impact, in part because of the decision to stick within spending limits set by the previous Conservative government. Dobson's abolition of the internal market in the [[National Health Service|NHS]] was reversed by his successor, [[Alan Milburn]].

===Candidate for Mayor of London===
Dobson was manoeuvred by the Labour Party leadership into announcing his resignation in order to stand as [[Mayor of London]] in the inaugural elections. He beat [[Ken Livingstone]] in the Labour Party's internal selection, helped by its electoral college system and the absence of any requirement for [[affiliated trade union]]s to ballot their members. In May 2000, Livingstone won the Mayoral election as an independent candidate. Dobson finished third behind the Conservative candidate [[Steven Norris]], and just ahead of the Liberal Democrat candidate [[Susan Kramer]]. Dobson was then re-elected as an MP, albeit with a reduced majority, in the May 2005 general election.

==Criticism and controversy==
Frank Dobson has been the subject of controversy for living in a council flat whilst on a six figure ministerial salary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5120047.ece Timesonline.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Labour leadership controversy following Tony Blair's declaration he would step down within a year of September 2006, Dobson called for Blair to step down right away and end uncertainty.

He also attacked [[Alan Milburn]] for making a 'terrible mess' of the NHS. Milburn had some hours earlier been mentioned by [[Charles Clarke]] as a possible future Labour leader.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uklatest/story/0,,-6067136,00.html Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobson has been criticised for hypocrisy for saying he was against Post Office closures, then voting for them in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hamhigh.co.uk/search/story.aspx?brand=Northlondon24&amp;category=Commentbroadway&amp;itemid=WeED28%20Mar%202008%2009:32:53:640&amp;tBrand=Northlondon24&amp;tCategory=search Ham &amp; High]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the expenses scandal, he strongly supported the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House]] in his attempts to block exposure of expenses - arguing he was merely being scapegoated (for instance on Radio 4, 10am, 16 May 2009). He also supported the Speaker in allowing a warrant-less search of the offices of a member of parliament, [[Damian Green]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank Dobson (December 2008). Daily Hansard - Debate. ''Hansard'', [http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm081208/debtext/81208-0005.htm Hansard]&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey of his constituents showed that, in 2008, Dobson responded to 69 letters out of 269 sent through WriteToThem.com, putting him in 605th place out of 638 MPs for which data were available.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.writetothem.com/stats/2008/mps?pc=nw1+9qr&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2009}}

Dobson married Janet Mary Alker in 1967. They have two sons and a daughter. He is a supporter of [[West Ham United]].

In late 2006 he underwent a quadruple cardiac arterial bypass and was absent from Parliament for a period.

'''James Gordon Brown''' (born 20 February 1951) is a [[British people|British]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[politician]] who was the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister of the]] [[United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] from [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2007|2007]] until [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010]]. He previously served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Blair ministry|Labour Government]] from [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]] to [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2007|2007]], becoming the longest-serving holder of that office in modern history. Brown has been a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) since [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983]], for [[Dunfermline East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dunfermline East]] until [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005]], and currently for [[Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (UK Parliament constituency)|Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath]].  

Brown became Prime Minister on 27 June 2007, after the resignation of [[Tony Blair]] and three days after becoming Leader of the governing Labour Party. His tenure ended on 11 May 2010, when he resigned as Prime Minister and Leader of the Labour Party. Brown was one of only three people to serve in the Cabinet continuously from Labour's victory in 1997 until its defeat in 2010, the others being [[Jack Straw]] and [[Alistair Darling]].

Brown has a [[PhD]] in history from the [[University of Edinburgh]] and spent his early career working as a lecturer at a [[further education college]] and a television [[journalist]].&lt;ref name=GBStory&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/4347369.stm | title= Brown seeks out 'British values' | author= Kearney, Martha | date= 14 March 2005 | accessdate= 23 January 2008 | work= BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6743875.stm | title= The Gordon Brown story | date= 27 June 2007 | accessdate= 11 July 2009 | work= BBC News | publisher= BBC | first=Brian | last=Wheeler}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3809861.stm | title= Gordon Brown timeline | date= 15 June 2004 | accessdate= 23 January 2008 | work= BBC News | publisher= BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;  He has been a Member of Parliament since 1983; first for [[Dunfermline East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dunfermline East]] and since 2005 for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath.&lt;ref name=&quot;npm&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6245682.stm | title= Brown is UK's new prime minister | date= 27 June 2007 | accessdate= 23 January 2008 | work= BBC News | publisher= BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/mpdb/html/712.stm | title= Gordon Brown | date= 19 November 2007 | accessdate= 23 January 2008 | work= BBC News | publisher= BBC |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070825194726/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/mpdb/html/712.stm |archivedate = August 25, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Prime Minister, he also held the offices of [[First Lord of the Treasury]] and the [[Minister for the Civil Service]].

Brown's time as Chancellor was marked by major reform of Britain's monetary and fiscal policy architecture, transferring interest rate setting powers to the [[Bank of England]], by a wide extension of the powers of the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] to cover much domestic policy and by transferring responsibility for banking supervision to the [[Financial Services Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financialstability/mou.pdf | title= Memorandum of Understanding between HM Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority | year= 1997| accessdate= 16 July 2009 | work= HM Treasury, Bank of England, FSA | publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversial moves included the abolition of [[advance corporation tax]] (ACT) relief in his first budget,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Halligan |first=Liam |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1531448/Brown's-raid-on-pensions-costs-Britain-andpound100-billion.html |title=Brown's raid on pensions costs Britain £100 billion |publisher=Telegraph |date=16 October 2006 |accessdate=27 February 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2002/jul/22/money.politics|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=4 August 2008|title=Pension blame falls on Brown | first=Heather | last=Stewart | date=22 July 2002 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the removal in his final budget of the 10% &quot;starting rate&quot; of personal income tax which he had introduced in 1999.&lt;ref name=10pence&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/apr/21/economy.labour|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=4 August 2008|title=Q&amp;A: 10p tax rate cut | first=Anil | last=Dawar | date=21 April 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was accepted by the [[University of Edinburgh]] to study history at the same early age of sixteen. During an end-of-term [[rugby union]] match at his old school he received a kick to the head and suffered a [[retinal detachment]]. This left him [[Blindness|blind]] in his left eye, despite treatment including several operations and weeks spent lying in a darkened room. Later at Edinburgh, while playing tennis, he noticed the same symptoms in his right eye.

From 1976 to 1980 Brown was employed as a [[lecturer]] in politics at [[Glasgow Caledonian University|Glasgow College of Technology]]. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]], he stood for the [[Edinburgh South (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh South]] constituency, losing to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate, [[Michael Ancram]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbb&quot;/&gt; From 1980 he worked as a journalist at [[Scottish Television]], later serving as current affairs editor until his election to parliament in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=334&amp;issue=115 &quot;Brown's Journey from Reformism to Neoliberalism&quot;] John Newsinger [[International Socialism (journal)|International Socialism]] 115 (summer 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked as a tutor for the [[Open University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.co.uk/news/business-and-industry/gordon-browns-tuc-speech-in-full-$478186.htm |title=Gordon Brown's TUC speech in full (to the 2007 TUC Congress) |publisher=politics.co.uk |date=10 September 2007|accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election to parliament and opposition==
Gordon Brown was elected to Parliament on his second attempt as a Labour MP for [[Dunfermline East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dunfermline East]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]]. His first Westminster office mate was a newly elected MP from the Sedgefield constituency by the name of [[Tony Blair]]. Brown became an [[opposition (government)|opposition]] spokesman on Trade and Industry in 1985. In 1986, he published a [[biography]] of the [[Independent Labour Party]] politician [[James Maxton]], the subject of his PhD thesis. Brown was [[Shadow Cabinet|Shadow]] [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]] from 1987 to 1989 and then Shadow [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]], before becoming Shadow Chancellor in 1992.&lt;ref name=GBStory/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbb&quot;/&gt; Having led the ''Labour Movement Yes'' campaign, refusing to join the cross-party ''Yes for Scotland'' campaign, during the [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum]], while other senior Labour politicians&amp;nbsp;— including [[Robin Cook]], [[Tam Dalyell]] and [[Brian Wilson (Labour politician)|Brian Wilson]] – campaigned for a ''No'' vote, Brown was subsequently a key participant in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]], signing the [[Claim of Right for Scotland]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kenyon |last=Wright |authorlink= Canon Kenyon Wright |url=

After the sudden death of Labour leader [[John Smith (UK politician)|John Smith]] in May 1994, Brown did not contest the leadership after [[Tony Blair]] became favourite, deciding to make way for Tony Blair to avoiding splitting the pro-modernising vote in the leadership ballot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/blair_tony.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has long been rumoured [[Blair-Brown deal|a deal]] was struck between Blair and Brown at the former [[Granita (restaurant)|Granita restaurant]] in [[A1 road (London)#Upper Street|Islington]], in which Blair promised to give Brown control of economic policy in return for Brown not standing against him in the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1994|leadership election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=White |authorlink=Michael White (journalist) |title=The guarantee which came to dominate new Labour politics for a decade |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2003/jun/06/uk.labour |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date= 6 June 2003|accessdate=1 March 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Catherine |last=Mayer |authorlink=Catherine Mayer |title=Fight Club |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901050124-1018039-2,00.html |work=Time Magazine |date=16 January 2005 |accessdate=1 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether this is true or not, the relationship between Blair and Brown has been central to the fortunes of &quot;[[Labour Party (UK)#&quot;New Labour&quot; – in government (1997–2010)|New Labour]]&quot;, and they have mostly remained united in public, despite reported serious private rifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Wheeler |title=The Tony Blair story |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6506365.stm |work=BBC News |date=10 May 2007 |accessdate=1 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Shadow Chancellor, Brown as Chancellor-in-waiting was seen as a good choice by business and the middle class. While he was Chancellor inflation sometimes exceeded the 2% target causing the [[Governor of the Bank of England]] to write several letters to the Chancellor, each time inflation exceeded three per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?ID=19 |title=Inflation |publisher=National Statistics Online|date= |accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?ID=12 |title=Employment|publisher=National Statistics Online |date=17 March 2010 |accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2005 following a reorganisation of [[List of UK Parliamentary constituencies in Scotland|parliamentary constituencies]] in Scotland, Brown became MP for [[Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (UK Parliament constituency)|Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/hoc/constituency/0,9338,-1059,00.html|title=The Guardian 2005 election results for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath | accessdate=2 April 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chancellor of the Exchequer==
{{Main|Chancellorship of Gordon Brown}}
In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], Labour defeated the Conservatives by a landslide to end their 18-year exile from government on when [[Tony Blair]], the new prime minister, announced his ministerial team on 2 May 1997, he appointed Brown as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. He would remain in this role for 10 years and two months, making him the longest-serving Chancellor in modern history.&lt;ref name=&quot;ddd&quot;/&gt; The Prime Minister's website highlights some achievements from Brown's decade as Chancellor: making the Bank of England independent and delivering an agreement on poverty and climate change at the [[G8]] summit in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbb&quot;/&gt;

===Early economic reforms===
On taking office as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] Brown gave the [[Bank of England]] operational independence in [[monetary policy]], and thus responsibility for setting [[interest rate]]s through the Bank's [[Monetary Policy Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/business/2002471.stm |title=Five years on: Rating the MPC|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=21 June 2009 | date=6 June 2002 | first=Steve | last=Schifferes}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time he also changed the [[inflation rate|inflation measure]] from the [[Retail Prices Index (United Kingdom)|Retail Price Index]] to the [[Consumer Price Index]] and transferred responsibility for banking supervision to the [[Financial Services Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.treasury.gov.uk/press/1997/p40_97.html |title=Chancellor announces new framework for monetary policy|publisher=HM Treasury |date=6 May 1997 |accessdate=27 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators have argued that this division of responsibilities exacerbated the severity, in Britain, of 2007 global banking crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article6410087.ece|title= Gordon Brown and Treasury accused on banking crisis|publisher=Times Online|accessdate=19 July 2009|date=2 June 2009 | first=Patrick | last=Hosking | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxation and spending===
In the 1997 election and subsequently, Brown pledged to not increase the basic or higher rates of [[income tax]]. Over his Chancellorship, he reduced the basic rate from 23% to 20%. However, in all but his final budget, Brown increased the tax thresholds in line with inflation, rather than earnings, resulting in [[fiscal drag]]. [[Corporation tax]] fell under Brown, from a main rate of 33% to 28%, and from 24% to 19% for [[small business]]es.&lt;ref name=AdamBrowne&gt;Adam, S. and J.

Conservatives have accused Brown of imposing &quot;[[stealth tax]]es&quot;. A commonly reported example resulted in 1997 from a technical change in the way [[corporation tax]] is collected, the indirect effect of which was for the [[dividend]]s on [[stock]] investments held within [[pension]]s to be taxed, thus lowering pension returns and contributing to the demise of most of the final salary pension funds in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Liam |last=Halligan |authorlink=Liam Halligan |title=Brown's raid on pensions costs Britain £100 billion |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/10/15/nbrown15.xml |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=16 October 2006 |accessdate=1 March 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Treasury contends that this tax change was crucial to long-term economic growth.

Brown's 2000 Spending Review outlined a major expansion of [[government spending]], particularly on health and education. In his April 2002 budget, Brown increased [[national insurance]] to pay for health spending. He also introduced [[working tax credit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5032170.stm More get tax credit overpayments] BBC News, 31 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifs.org.uk/bns/bn52.pdf#search=%22working%20tax%20credit%2016%20hours%22 The impact of tax and benefit changes between April 2000 and April 2003 on parents' labour supply] Blundell, R., M. Brewer and A. Shepherd, [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]], Briefing Note No. 52, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===European single currency===
In October 1997, Brown took control of the United Kingdom's membership of the European single currency issue by announcing the Treasury would set [[five economic tests]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Julian |last=Glover |title=The five tests |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2000/sep/29/emu.theeuro4 |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=29 September 2000 |accessdate=1 March 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ascertain whether the economic case had been made.

===Other issues===
In 2000, Brown was accused of starting a political row about higher education (referred to as the [[Laura Spence Affair]]) when he accused the University of Oxford of elitism in its admissions procedures, describing its decision not to offer a place to [[state school]] pupil Laura Spence as &quot;absolutely outrageous&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/764141.stm| title = Oxford 'reject' wins Harvard scholarship| accessdate = 30 March 2007| date = 22 May 2000| work = BBC News| publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Jenkins|Lord Jenkins]], then Oxford [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] and himself a former Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, said &quot;nearly every fact he used was false.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/792021.stm| title = Peers condemn Oxford attack| accessdate = 30 March 2007| date = 15 June 2000| work = BBC News| publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Main articles [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2007|Labour Party leadership election, 2007]] and [[Timeline for the Labour Party (UK) leadership elections, 2007|Timeline for the Labour Party leadership elections, 2007]]

In October 2004, [[Tony Blair]] announced he would not lead the party into a fourth [[general election]], but would serve a full third term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2004/oct/01/uk.labourconference2|title=Blair: I will serve a full third term|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=19 July 2009|date=21 October 2004 | first=Michael | last=White | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political comment over the relationship between Brown and Blair continued up to and beyond the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 election]], which Labour won with a reduced parliamentary majority and reduced vote share. Blair announced on 7 September 2006 that he would step down within a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Alan | last = Cowell|authorlink=Alan Cowell | title = Blair to Give Up Post as Premier Within One Year|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/08/world/europe/08blair.html?ex=1315368000&amp;en=5e7bcfe77c01e050&amp;ei=5088 |date = 8 September 2006 | work = The New York Times | publisher = [[The New York Times Company]] |accessdate = 10 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown was the clear favourite to succeed Blair; he was the only [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2007|candidate]] spoken of seriously in Westminster. Appearances and news coverage leading up to the handover were interpreted as preparing the ground for Brown to become [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], in part by creating the impression of a statesman with a vision for leadership and [[global change]]. This enabled Brown to signal the most significant priorities for his agenda as Prime Minister; speaking at a [[Fabian Society]] conference on 'The Next Decade' in January 2007, he stressed education, international development, narrowing inequalities (to pursue 'equality of opportunity and fairness of outcome'), renewing Britishness, restoring trust in politics, and winning hearts and minds in the war on terror as key priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title = Make education our national mission |publisher = [[Fabian Society]] | date = 15 January 2007 |url= http://www.fabian-society.org.uk/events/event-reports/brown-make-education-our-national-mission|accessdate= 21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prime Minister==
{{Main|Premiership of Gordon Brown}}
Brown ceased to be Chancellor and became the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on 27 June 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;npm&quot;/&gt; Like all modern Prime Ministers, Brown concurrently served as the [[First Lord of the Treasury]] and the [[Minister for the Civil Service]], and was a member of the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom]]. Until his resignation from the post in May 2010 he was [[Labour Party (UK)#Leaders of the Labour Party since 1906|Leader of the Labour Party]]. He is Member of Parliament for the constituency of [[Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (UK Parliament constituency)|Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath]]. He is the sixth post-war prime minister, of a total of 12, to assume the role without having won a general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=O'Connor, John Kennedy|title=Brown's Ascendency|publisher=ABC Radio National Perspective|date=25 June 2007|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/perspective/stories/2007/1960948.htm|accessdate=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Brown was the first prime minister from a Scottish constituency since the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Alec Douglas-Home|Sir Alec Douglas-Home]] in 1964. Not all British prime ministers have attended university, but of the ones that did Brown was one of only five that did not attend either Oxford or Cambridge, the others were,  [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|the Earl of Bute]] ([[University of Leiden|Leiden]]), [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] ([[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]]), [[Bonar Law|Andrew Bonar Law]] ([[University of Glasgow]]), and [[Neville Chamberlain]] ([[Mason Science College]], later [[University of Birmingham|Birmingham]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A4197440 | title = Are you Statistically Prepared to Become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom? | accessdate=30 March 2007 | date = 1 August 2005 | work = h2g2 | publisher = BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown proposed moving some traditional prime ministerial powers conferred by [[royal prerogative]] to the realm of Parliament, such as the power to declare war and approve appointments to senior positions. Brown wanted Parliament to gain the right to ratify treaties and have more oversight into the intelligence services. He also proposed moving some powers from Parliament to citizens, including the right to form &quot;citizens' juries&quot;, easily petition Parliament for new laws, and rally outside Westminster. He asserted that the attorney general should not have the right to decide whether to prosecute in individual cases, such as in the [[Cash for Peerages|loans for peerages]] scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Gordon Brown's big idea|url=http://www.economist.com/world/britain/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9441642|publisher =The Economist|date=5 July 2007|accessdate=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his Labour leadership campaign Brown proposed some policy initiatives which he called 'The manifesto for change.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Gordon's manifesto for change | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article1782142.ece | work = The Times | date = 13 May 2007 | accessdate = 15 July 2009 | location=London | first=Deirdre | last=Hipwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Poll surge as Brown unveils policy blitz | url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/politics/story/0,,2078595,00.html | work = The Observer|date= 13 May 2007 | location=London | first=Nicholas | last=Watt | accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The manifesto included a clampdown on corruption and a new [[Ministerial Code]], which set out clear standards of behaviour for ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6258794.stm|date=3 July 2007|accessdate=3 August 2008|publisher=BBC News|title=Brown sets out reform proposals}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown also stated in a speech when announcing his bid that he wants a &quot;better constitution&quot; that is &quot;clear about the rights and responsibilities of being a citizen in Britain today&quot;. He planned to set up an all-party convention to look at new powers for Parliament and to look at rebalancing powers between [[Whitehall]] and local government. Brown said he would give Parliament the final say on whether British troops are sent into action in future.

Brown said he wanted to release more land and ease access to ownership with shared equity schemes. He backed a proposal to build new [[Eco-towns (UK)|eco-towns]], each housing between 10,000 and 20,000 home-owners&amp;nbsp;— up to 100,000 new homes in total.
Brown also said he wanted to have doctors' surgeries open at the weekends, and GPs on call in the evenings. Doctors were given the right of opting out of out-of-hours care in 2007, under a controversial pay deal, signed by then-Health Secretary [[John Reid (politician)|John Reid]], which awarded them a 22% pay rise in 2006. Brown also stated in the manifesto that the NHS was his top priority. 

There was speculation during September and early October 2007 about whether Brown would call a [[snap election|snap general election]]. Brown announced at the time that there would be no [[United Kingdom general election|election]] any time soon - despite opinion polls showing that he was capable of winning an election should he call one. However, this proved to be a costly mistake, as during 2008 his party slid behind the Conservatives (led by David Cameron) in the polls. Disputes over political donations, a string of losses in local elections, and by-election losses in [[Crewe]] and [[Glasgow]] did himself and the government no favours either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8673608.stm | work=BBC News | first=James | last=Landale | title=Gordon Brown's political career | date=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His political opponents accused him of being indecisive, which Brown denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Brown rules out autumn election | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7031749.stm | publisher=BBC News|accessdate= 6 October 2007 | date=6 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2008 Brown supported a [[Counter-Terrorism Bill 2008|new bill extending this pre-charge detention period to 42 days]].

Brown was mentioned by the press in the expenses crisis for claiming for the payment of his cleaner. However, no wrongdoing was found and the Commons Authority did not pursue Brown over the claim. Meanwhile, the Commons Fees Office stated that a double payment for a £153 plumbing repair bill was a mistake on their part and that Brown had repaid it in full.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/may/10/gordon-brown-cleaner-mps-expenses |title=MPs' expenses: the true story of Gordon Brown, the cleaner and my husband |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=13 May 2009 | date=10 May 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbckeydetails&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8039273.stm |title=MPs' expenses claims&amp;nbsp;— key details |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=13 May 2009 | date=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy===
[[File:President Barack Obama meets Prime Minister Gordon Brown.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Gordon Brown and President [[Barack Obama]] meet in the [[White House]]]]
Brown was committed to the [[Iraq War]], but said in a speech in June 2007 that he would &quot;learn the lessons&quot; from the mistakes made in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=George | last=Jones | coauthors= | title=The subtle shift in British foreign policy | date=12 June 2007 | publisher= | url =http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/06/11/wbrown111.xml | work =Telegraph.co.uk | pages = | accessdate = 23 September 2007 | language = | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown said in a letter published on 17 March 2008 that the United Kingdom would hold an inquiry into the [[Iraq war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/there-will-be-a-public-inquiry-into-iraq-says-brown-796851.html|title=

Brown went to great lengths to empathise with those who lost family members in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. He has often said &quot;War is tragic&quot;, echoing Blair's memorable quote, &quot;War is horrible&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Dougary, Ginny | authorlink = Ginny Dougary | title = What Gordon Brown is really thinking | work = The Times | date = 10 April 2010 | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7088875.ece | accessdate = 27 April 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, in November 2007 Brown was accused by some senior military figures of not adhering to the '[[military covenant]]', a convention within British politics insuring adequate safeguards, rewards and compensation for military personnel who risk their lives in obedience to orders derived from the policy of the elected government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Renew the Military Covenant | publisher=The Independent|url=http://comment.independent.co.uk/leading_articles/article3149962.ece | accessdate= 11 November 2007 | location=London | date=11 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown skipped the opening ceremony of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], on 8 August 2008 in Beijing. He attended the closing ceremony instead, on 24 August 2008. Brown had been under intense pressure from human rights campaigners to send a message to China, concerning the [[2008 Tibetan unrest]]. His decision not to attend the opening ceremony was not an act of protest, but rather was made several weeks in advance and not intended as a stand on principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7339580.stm|title=PM not attending Olympics opening|accessdate=19 July 2009|publisher=BBC News|date=10 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech in July 2007, Brown personally clarified his position regarding Britain's relationship with the USA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Speech not critical of US&amp;nbsp;— Brown|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6896797.stm|accessdate = 14 July 2007 | date=13 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;We will not allow people to separate us from the United States of America in dealing with the common challenges that we face around the world. I think people have got to remember that the special relationship between a British prime minister and an American president is built on the things that we share, the same enduring values about the importance of liberty, opportunity, the dignity of the individual. I will continue to work, as Tony Blair did, very closely with the American administration.&quot;

Brown and the Labour party had pledged to allow a referendum on the EU [[Treaty of Lisbon]]. On the morning of 13 December 2007, Foreign Secretary [[David Miliband]] attended for the Prime Minister at the official signing ceremony in Lisbon of the [[EU Reform Treaty]]. Brown's opponents on both sides of the House, and in the press, suggested that ratification by Parliament was not enough and that a referendum should also be held. Labour's 2005 manifesto had pledged to give British public a referendum on the original [[EU Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Gordon Brown attacked on all sides for 'running away' from referendum | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article2718086.ece | accessdate= 23 October 2007| publisher= Times Online| date=23 October 2007 | location=London | first=Francis | last=Elliott}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7023458.stm|title=Cameron attacks Brown on EU vote|publisher=BBC News|date=2 October 2007|accessdate=15 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown argued that the Treaty significantly differed from the Constitution, and as such did not require a referendum. He also responded with plans for a lengthy debate on the topic, and stated that he believed the document to be too complex to be decided by referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Battle of the EU treaty to last for months | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article2687253.ece | accessdate= 19 October 2007| publisher=Times Online| date=19 October 2007 | first1=Francis | last1=Elliott | first2=David | last2=Charter | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug policy===
During Brown's premiership, in October 2008, the [[Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs]] (ACMD) recommended to the then [[Home Secretary]] [[Jacqui Smith]] that [[cannabis]] remain classified as a [[Class C drug]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News cannabis&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7845023.stm | work=BBC News | title=Debate over cannabis classification | date=31 October 2009 | accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acting against the advice of the Council, she chose to reclassify it as [[class B drug|class B]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News cannabis&quot;/&gt; After Professor [[David Nutt]], the chair of the ACMD, criticised this move in a lecture in 2009, he was asked to step down by then Home Secretary [[Alan Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8334774.stm | work=BBC News | title=Cannabis row drugs adviser sacked | date=30 October 2009 | accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his resignation, Professor Nutt said Gordon Brown had &quot;made up his mind&quot; to reclassify cannabis despite evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref name=Batty20091031&gt;Batty, David [http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/oct/31/david-nutt-drugs-adviser-sacked Professor David Nutt warns resignations may result from prime minister's 'absurd' stance on reclassification] The Guardian, 31 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon Brown had argued, &quot;I don't think that the previous studies took into account that so much of the cannabis on the streets is now of a lethal quality and we really have got to send out a message to young people – this is not acceptable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKL2973937220080430 Brown says message must be sent on cannabis], Reuters, 20 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oates, John [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/29/brown_cannabis_science Brown opts for morality over science on 'lethal skunk'] The Register, 29 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Nutt's predecessor at the ACMD, [[Michael Rawlins|Sir Michael Rawlins]], later said, &quot;Governments may well have good reasons for taking an alternative view...

===Global recession===

Brown's premiership coincided with the [[Late-2000s recession|global recession]], during which Brown called for fiscal action in an attempt to stimulate aggregate demand. Domestically, Brown's administration introduced measures including a bank rescue package worth around £500 billion (approximately $850 billion), a temporary 2.5% cut in Value Added Tax (Sales Tax)&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7757854.stm | VAT tax reduction (dated December 2008 from the BBC website)&lt;/ref&gt; and a &quot;car scrappage&quot; scheme.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8278679.stm | Car scrappage scheme extended (2009 BBC website)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plots against leadership===
In mid-2008, Brown's leadership was presented with a challenge as some MPs openly called for him to resign. This event was dubbed the 'Lancashire Plot', as two backbenchers from [[Local Government Act 1972|(pre-1974) Lancashire]] urged him to step down and a third questioned his chances of holding on to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leadership. Several MPs argued that if Brown did not recover in the polls by early 2009, he should call for a leadership contest. However, certain prominent MPs, such as [[Jacqui Smith]] and [[Bill Rammell]], suggested that Brown was the right person to lead Britain through its economic crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Cabinet backs Brown but 'Lancashire plot' sparks open warfare | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cabinet-backs-brown-but-lancashire-plot-sparks-open-warfare-879414.html | accessdate= 29 July 2008 | publisher=The Independent| first1=Nigel | last1=Morris | date=29 July 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Autumn, [[Siobhain McDonagh]], a MP and junior government whip, who during her time in office had never voted against the government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7613296.stm|title=Profile: Siobhain McDonagh|publisher=BBC News|date=12 September 2008|accessdate=14 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; spoke of the need for discussion over Brown's position. McDonagh was sacked from her role shortly afterwards, on 12 September. Whilst McDonagh did not state that she wanted Brown deposed, she implored the Labour party to hold a leadership election, she was sacked from her role shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name=Whipsacked&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7613086.stm|title=Whip sacked over leader bid call|publisher=BBC News|date=12 September 2008|accessdate=14 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDonagh was supported by [[Joan Ryan]] (who applied, as McDonagh had, for leadership nomination papers, and became the second rebel to be fired from her job), [[Jim Dowd (politician)|Jim Dowd]], [[Greg Pope]], and a string of others who had previously held positions in government, made clear their desire for a contest.&lt;ref name=Exministers&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4749182.ece|title=Ex-ministers join Gordon Brown rebellion|publisher=The Times|author=Jonathan Oliver, Marie Woolf|date=14 September 2008|accessdate=14 September 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the face of this speculation over Brown's future, his ministers backed him to lead the party, and [[Harriet Harman]] and [[David Miliband]] denied that they were preparing leadership bids. After Labour lost the [[Glasgow East by-election, 2008|Glasgow East by-election]] in July, Harman, the deputy leader of the party, said that Brown was the &quot;solution&quot;, not the &quot;problem&quot;; Home Secretary Smith, Justice Secretary [[Jack Straw]], Schools Secretary [[Ed Balls]] and Cabinet Office Minister [[Ed Miliband]] all re-affirmed their support for Brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7531576.stm|title=Harman denies planning leader bid|publisher=BBC News|date=29 July 2008|accessdate=14 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deputy Prime Minister under Blair, [[John Prescott]], also pledged his support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7527725.stm|title=Prescott warns over PM challenge|publisher=BBC News|date=27 July 2008|accessdate=14 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign Secretary David Miliband then denied that he was plotting a leadership bid, when on 30 July, an article written by him in ''[[The Guardian]]'' was interpreted by a large number in the media as an attempt to undermine Brown. In the article, Miliband outlined the party's future, but neglected to mention the Prime Minister. Miliband, responded to this by saying that he was confident Brown could lead Labour to victory in the next general election, and that his article was an attack against the [[fatalism]] in the party since the loss of Glasgow-East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7532691.stm|title=Miliband denies 'leadership' bid|publisher=BBC News|date=30 July 2008|accessdate=14 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miliband continued to show his support for Brown in the face of the challenge that emerged in September, as did Business Secretary [[John Hutton, Baron Hutton of Furness|John Hutton]], Environment Secretary [[Hilary Benn]], and Chief Whip [[Geoff Hoon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7615274.stm|title=Miliband throws support behind PM|publisher=BBC News|date=14 September 2008|accessdate=14 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 January 2010, [[Patricia Hewitt]] and [[Geoff Hoon]] jointly called for a secret ballot on the future of Brown's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jan/06/hoon-hewitt-gordon-brown-labour |title=Hewitt and Hoon's great gamble |publisher=The Guardian |date=6 January 2010 | location=London | first=Martin | last=Kettle | accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The call received little support and the following day Hoon said that it appeared to have failed and was &quot;over&quot;. Brown later referred to the call for a secret ballot as a &quot;form of silliness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8450375.stm |title=Gordon Brown says leadership challenge was 'silliness' |publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=10 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===By-elections and 2009 local and European elections===
[[File:G8brown.JPG|thumb|left|Gordon Brown meeting Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] in 2006|alt=Gordon Brown shakes hands with Vladimir Putin]]
In the local elections on 1 May 2008, Labour suffered their worst results in 40 years finishing in third place with a projected 24% share of the national vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Labour suffers big council losses | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7372860.stm| work = BBC News | date = 2 May 2008  | accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently the party has seen the loss of [[by-election]]s in [[Crewe and Nantwich by-election, 2008|Nantwich and Crewe]] and [[Henley by-election, 2008|Henley]] as well as slumps in the polls. A [[Glasgow East by-election, 2008|by-election in Glasgow East]] triggered by the resignation of [[David Marshall (UK politician)|David Marshall]] saw the Labour party struggle to appoint a candidate, eventually settling for [[Margaret Curran (politician)|Margaret Curran]], a sitting MSP in the [[Scottish Parliament]]. The SNP, Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have all derided the party for their disorganised nature with [[Alex Salmond]] commenting &quot;This is their 'lost weekend' – they don't have a leader in Scotland, they don't have a candidate in Glasgow East, and they have a prime minister who refuses to come to the constituency&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7491574.stm|title=Labour MSP joins by-election race|accessdate=3 August 2008 | date=5 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labour lost the constituency to the [[Scottish National Party]]'s [[John Mason (Scottish politician)|John Mason]] who took 11,277 votes with Labour just 365 behind. The seat experienced a swing of 22.54%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7522153.stm|title=

In the [[European Parliament elections, 2009 (United Kingdom)|European elections]], Labour polled 16% of the vote, finishing in third place behind the Conservatives and [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8088133.stm |title=Labour slumps to historic defeat |publisher=BBC News |date=8 June 2009 |accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voter apathy was reflected in the historically low turnout of around thirty three percent. In Scotland voter turnout was only twenty eight per cent. In the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2009|local elections]], Labour polled 23% of the vote, finishing in third place behind [[Conservative Party(UK)|Conservatives]] and [[Liberal Democrats]], with Labour losing control of the four councils it had held prior to the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/elections/local_council/09/html/region_999999.stm |title=Election 2009 &amp;#124; Councils A-Z |publisher=BBC News |date=7 June 2009 |accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a vote widely considered to be a reaction to the expenses scandal, the share of the votes was down for all the major parties; Labour was down one percent, the Conservative share was down five percent. The beneficiary of the public backlash was generally seen to be the minor parties, including the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] and UKIP. These results were Labour's worst since World War II. Gordon Brown was quoted in the press as having said that the results were &quot;a painful defeat for Labour&quot;, and that &quot;too many good people doing so much good for their communities and their constituencies have lost through no fault of their own.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;timesonline1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8088358.stm|title=Salmond hails historic Euro win|publisher=BBC News | date=8 June 2009 | accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General election 2010===

{{Main|United Kingdom general election, 2010}}
In April 2010, Brown asked the Queen to dissolve Parliament and call new elections, which included the first televised leadership debates in British History. The result of the election was a [[hung parliament]], laying the foundations for the first full coalition government since 1974 and only the second since the Grand Coalition during World War II that sat for almost 8 years.

Brown was re-elected to serve as MP for Kirkcaldy &amp; Cowdenbeath constituency on 6 May 2010 with 29,559 votes representing 64.5% of votes.&lt;ref name=GBKC2010/&gt;

===Resignation===
{{further|[[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2010]]}}
Brown announced on 10 May 2010 that he would stand down as Labour Leader, with a view to a successor being chosen before the next [[Labour Party Conference]] in September 2010.&lt;ref name=resignation&gt;{{cite news |title=Gordon Brown 'stepping down as Labour leader'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8672859.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |date=10 May 2010 |accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, negotiations between the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats to form a coalition government failed. During the evening, Brown visited [[Buckingham Palace]] to tender his resignation as Prime Minister to [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and to recommend that she invite the Leader of the Opposition, [[David Cameron]], to form a government. He resigned as leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect.&lt;ref name=PMRes/&gt;

==Post-Prime Ministership==
===Return to the backbenches===
On 13 May 2010, in his first public appearance since leaving [[10 Downing Street]], two days after resigning as Prime Minister and Leader of the Labour Party, Brown confirmed he intended to stay on in Parliament, serving as a Labour [[Backbencher]], in order to serve the people of his [[Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (UK Parliament constituency)|Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath constituency]].&lt;ref name=BBC13May2010Backbencher&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8681018.stm |title=Brown to remain as backbench MP |publisher=BBC News |date=13 May 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Wide Web Foundation===
[[Sir Tim Berners-Lee]] worked with the UK government during Brown's premiership to publish government data as freely as possible on the internet in the [[data.gov.uk]] project. Berners-Lee subsequently invited Brown to become a board director of the World Wide Web Foundation to &quot;advise the Web Foundation on ways to involve disadvantaged communities and global leaders in the development of sustainable programs that connect humanity and affect positive change&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webfoundation.org/2010/09/gordon-brown-joins-world-wide-web-foundation-board/ Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown Joins World Wide Web Foundation’s Board of Directors], ''[[World Wide Web Foundation]]'' 2 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, media reports linked Brown with the role as the next Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund following the scheduled retirement of Dominique Strauss-Kahn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1376712/Gordon-Brown-favourite-head-IMF-George-Osborne-stop-him.html | newspaper=Daily Mail | title=Brown 'clear favourite' to be next head of IMF but will Osborne fight to stop him? | date=14 April 2011 | location=London | first=Alex | last=Brummer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown's successor and Leader of the Opposition, Ed Milliband, supported Brown for the role while the Prime Minister, David Cameron, voiced opposition to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/apr/19/gordon-brown-not-most-appropriate-imf-cameron|newspaper=Guardian|title=Gordon Brown 'not most appropriate person' to head IMF, says Cameron|date=19 April 2011|accessdate=18 October 2011|location=London|first=Helene|last=Mulholland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the arrest of Strauss-Kahn for alleged sexual assault in May 2011, and his subsequent resignation, these reports re-surfaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/may/20/gordon-brown-imf-strauss-kahn | newspaper=Guardian | title=Gordon Brown makes IMF pitch as race to succeed Strauss-Kahn intensifies | date=20 May 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2011 | location=London | first=Larry | last=Elliott}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for Brown among economists was mixed but British Government backing for his candidature was not forthcoming and instead supported Christine Lagarde—the eventual successful candidate—for the post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2011/05/24/economist-backs-gordon-brown-for-imf-top-job-115875-23152474|title=Economist backs Gordon Brown for IMF top job|newspaper=The Mirror|date=24 May 2011|accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/home/world-news/article/15994318 |title=Brown 'Not Right' To Take Over IMF Top Job |date=19 May 2011 |publisher=Sky News |accessdate=14 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Germany, Britain back Lagarde to lead IMF|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/germany-britain-back-lagarde-to-lead-imf/2011/05/21/AFVrri8G_story.html|accessdate=22 May 2011|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=22 May 2011|first=Cecilia|last=Kang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst [[Prime minister|PM]] Brown spent some of his spare time at [[Chequers]], the house often being filled with friends. The Browns have entertained local dignitaries like Sir Leonard Figg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article4386767.ece|title=Alice Thomson, ''No PM, However Dour, can Resist the Charms of a Stately Pile'', The Times, 24 July 2008 | location=London | date=24 July 2008 | accessdate=2 April 2010 | first=Deirdre | last=Hipwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown is also a friend of Harry Potter author [[J.

==Religion==
The son of a [[Church of Scotland]] [[minister (Christianity)|minister]], Brown has talked about what he calls his &quot;[[moral compass]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/gordon-brown-i-joined-this-party-as-a-teenager--its-values-are-my-moral-compass-454560.html|title=

In April 2009, Brown gave what was the first ever speech by a serving Prime Minister at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in London. He referred to a 'single powerful modern sense demanding responsibility from all and fairness to all'. He also talked about the [[Christian doctrine]] of 'do to others what you would have them do unto you', which he compared to similar principles in [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Sikhism]]. He went on, 'They each and all reflect a sense that we share the pain of others, and a sense that we believe in something bigger than ourselves—that we cannot be truly content while others face despair, cannot be completely at ease while others live in fear, cannot be satisfied while others are in sorrow&quot;, and continued, &quot;We all feel, regardless of the source of our philosophy, the same deep moral sense that each of us is our brother and sisters' keeper... We cannot and will not pass by on the other side when people are suffering and when we have it within our power to help.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1166182/Brown-DOES-God-calls-new-world-order-sermon-St-Pauls.html|title=Brown DOES do God as he calls for new world order in sermon at St Paul's|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=26 October 2009 | location=London | first=James | last=Chapman | date=1 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socialism==
Brown first thought of himself as being 'Labour' and his sense of social injustice was roused when he accompanied his father on visits around [[Kirkcaldy]] seeing the pain of unemployment and the misery of poverty and squalor as the mining and textile industries collapsed. Growing up he discovered [[R. H. Tawney|Tawney]], [[Robert Tressell|Tressell]], [[G. D. H. Cole|Cole]] and other socialist texts which inspired him. He also found inspiration in [[William Blake|Blake]] in poetry, [[Dennis Potter|Potter]] in drama, [[D. H. Lawrence|Lawrence]] in literature and the socialist leader [[James Maxton]] in Scottish history. These, he argues, fuelled his passion and activism, reinforcing his own political experience. For Brown the ethical basis of British socialism has several themes: the view that individuals are not primarily self-centered but are co-operative, that people are more likely to thrive in communities in which they play a full role and that people have talents and potential that the free market will not allow them to fully realise. In addition, one of the most enduring of Brown's themes is the commitment to equality.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Brown (1995) The aim of the rose, The Independent on Sunday, 18 June&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Gordon (ed.); Wright, Tony (ed.)

{{see also|City Law School|Bar Vocational Course}}

The '''Inns of Court School of Law''', often abbreviated to '''ICSL''' is a professional legal training institution based in [[London]] in [[Gray's Inn]].  Until 1999 the ICSL had a monopoly on the provision of the [[Bar Vocational Course]] (BVC), the obligatory professional training for would-be [[barristers]] in [[England and Wales]], before they commence [[pupillage]].

The School now also teaches the [[Legal Practice Course]] (LPC) for would-be [[solicitors]].  In 2007 it received the highest grading from the [[Law Society of England and Wales]] for its provision.  The School also provides a range of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) courses and a [[Master of Laws]] (LLM) programme.

Students who successfully complete the BVC are awarded a [[Postgraduate Diploma]]. The ICSL provides all its bar students with the opportunity of upgrading that diploma to a full LLM through the submission of a [[dissertation]].

==History==
The ICSL was founded by the Council of Legal Education in 1852. Before that time the [[Inns of Court]] were responsible for the education of young barristers. There was call during the nineteenth century for the education of barristers to be unified and thus the Council of Legal Education was formed and ICSL founded. Since 2001 the ICSL has been affiliated with and administered by [[City University London|City University]].

When the ICSL was first created, each of the four Inns of Court were required to each provide two rooms for the school. Until just after the second world war the ICSL was located in [[Lincoln's Inn]]. In the 1950s a purpose built building was built at 4 [[Gray's Inn]] Place within Gray's Inn and the school relocated there. Shortly after that Atkin Building in Gray's Inn was secured and then in the 1980s a further building was acquired for the ICSL in Princeton street.

==Campus==
As mentioned above the ICSL is mainly based in [[Gray's Inn]] and has three buildings, 4 Gray's Inn Place (GIP), Atkin Building (AB) and Princeton Street (PS).

4 Gray's Inn Place houses the library, school office and the staff offices. Located in Atkin Building is the lecture theatre, (formerly named Morrison Hall), the Common Room, the Muslim Prayer Room and several small group rooms. The Princeston Street building houses a computer suite and a number of small group rooms as well as playing host to the school's pro bono facilities and the video recording rooms.

All small group rooms are specifically maintained to accommodate a class of twelve, although the rooms can accommodate a few more students without desk space. Each room has a television, video camera and DVD player to allow for filming a student's advocacy performances.

==Famous alumni==
As might perhaps be expected from the institution which had a monopoly on half of the legal training in a large jurisdiction for nearly a century and a half, the alumni of the ICSL includes many judges, [[Queen's Counsel]], and distinguished academics. Others who went on to achieve the highest distinction include four [[British prime ministers|British Prime Ministers]] — [[Tony Blair]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Clement Attlee]] and [[Herbert Asquith]] — [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah|M A Jinnah]] (first Governor General and founder of [[Pakistan]]), and [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] (first Prime Minister of [[India]]).

==Scholarships==
In 2007 the ICSL introduced a new scholarship award scheme, worth over £25,000, for the [[Bar Vocational Course|BVC]]. Each scholarship award is made through each [[Inns of Court|Inn of Court]], the professional societies to which every English and Welsh barrister must belong.

==Coat of arms==
The ICSL Coat of Arms is pictured at the top of this page, the picture is taken from the front entrance to Gray's Inn Place. The Arms consists of th joint Coats of Arms of all four Inns of Court, namely (in order) Lincoln's Inn, the Middle Temple, the Inner Temple and Gray's Inn. The Council of Legal Education used a similar form of the Arms.

==Rebranding==
Since July 2008, the ICSL brand was dropped and replaced with the [[City Law School]] brand. Replacement of the ICSL brand was phased in gradually. Initially both logos were used on the school stationery, then the 2007-2008 manuals bore the City Law School name with the ICSL logo, and now all notices in the school are being fully replaced with the City Law School logo. However, the options manuals still have the ICSL logo.

Many students currently at the ICSL still refer to it by that name and also when students  and alumni state either verbally or in written form, such as their CV, they went to the ICSL without any mention of [[City University, London|City University London]].

One possible motive for the rebranding of the ICSL appears to be from pressure from the Bar Council resulting from complaints raised by other BVC providers of the association the Inns within the name of the ICSL and the unfair prejudice other providers receive from that.

==Key Personalities==
The current Dean of the Inns of Court School of Law is Professor Adrian Keane. In addition to leading ICSL, Professor Keane is also the author of the Modern Law of Evidence and a contributing author to both Blackstone's Civil Practice and Blackstone's Criminal Practice. The current BVC Course Director is Stuart Sime, who is also the Co-ordinator of the Civil Litigation module. Mr Sime is also the author of a Practical Approach to Civil Litigation, author and editor of the ICSL Civil Litigation Manual and co-editor of Blackstone's Civil Practice.

==BVC Association==
The purpose of the BVC Association is to provide parties and social activities for those students at ICSL reading for the bar. The ICSL provides the BVC Association with a sum of money for the purpose of undertaking this task. All BVC students are automatically members of the BVC Association. The Committee Officers are the President, Vice President, Social Secretary and Treasurer, all of which are elected by the BVC students.

'''John Whitaker &quot;Jack&quot; Straw''' (born 3 August 1946) is a British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician who has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Blackburn (UK Parliament constituency)|Blackburn]] since [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979]]. He served as [[Home Secretary]] from 1997 to 2001, [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2001 to 2006 and [[Lord Privy Seal]] and [[Leader of the House of Commons]] from 2006 to 2007 under [[Tony Blair]]. From 2007 to 2010 he was the [[Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain]] and the [[Secretary of State for Justice]], appointed as part of Prime Minister [[Brown Ministry|Gordon Brown's first Cabinet]]. Straw is one of only three people to have served in Cabinet continuously from 1997 to 2010 (the others being [[Gordon Brown]] and [[Alistair Darling]]).

When the Labour Party lost power in May 2010, he briefly became the [[Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain|Shadow Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain]], [[Secretary of State for Justice|Shadow Secretary of State for Justice]] and the [[Deputy Prime Minister|Shadow Deputy Prime Minister]], but stood down from the frontbench after the Labour Party elected a new [[Shadow Cabinet]].

==Early life==
Straw was born in [[Buckhurst Hill]], Essex, England. One of his maternal great-grandparents was a [[Jew]]ish German immigrant.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/how-jewish-is/how-jewish-jack-straw&lt;/ref&gt; Straw was brought up at [[Loughton]], Essex by his mother, Joan Sylvia Gilbey&lt;ref name = who&gt;Who's Who 2008, A &amp; C Black, 2008; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;General Register Office Birth Index 1946 Q3 Epping 5a 178&lt;/ref&gt; on a [[council housing|council estate]] after his father Walter Arthur Whitaker Straw,&lt;ref name = who/&gt; an insurance salesman, left the family and condemned them to poverty. Walter Straw had been sent to prison in 1939 for being a [[conscientious objector]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Delgado [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1183450/My-fathers-spell-jail-Jack-Straw-Secretary-State-Justice.html &quot;My father's spell in jail, by Jack Straw (Secretary of State for Justice)&quot;],''Daily Mail'', 16 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated at Staples Road School, Loughton, and then boarded at [[Brentwood School (Brentwood, England)|Brentwood School]], at that time a [[direct grant grammar school]] with largely LEA supported pupils, (where he was already expressing political ambitions and took the name &quot;Jack&quot;, allegedly after the 14th century peasant leader [[Jack Straw (rebel leader)|Jack Straw]]—although &quot;Jack&quot; is a common diminutive of &quot;John&quot;) and read law at the [[University of Leeds]].  While he was at Brentwood he opted out of the compulsory [[combined cadet force|CCF]] (combined cadet force) on conscientious grounds.

Straw was elected chair of the Leeds University Labour Society at the 1966 Annual General Meeting, when the Society changed its name to Leeds University Socialist Society and withdrew its support from the Labour Party (a separate Labour Club was later formed by supporters of the Labour Party in Leeds University Union).  Straw was incorrectly alleged by the [[Foreign Office]] to have disrupted a student trip to [[Chile]] to build a youth centre and was branded a &quot;troublemaker acting with malice aforethought&quot; by the [[Foreign Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5228770.stm|title=Straw comments reflect Cabinet unease |work=BBC News  | date=30 July 2006 | accessdate=5 January 2010 | first=Mark | last=Sanders}}&lt;/ref&gt; Straw was then elected president of [[Leeds University Union]] with the support of the Broad Left, a coalition including Liberal, Socialist (formerly Labour, see above) and the Communist Societies. The Leeds University Union Council recently reinstated Jack Straw's life membership of the union, as a previous motion had removed his life membership and led to the removal of his name from the Presidents’ Board owing to disagreement with his involvement in anti-terror legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luuonline.com/referendum/documents/ucagenda5nov07.pdf|title=Leeds University Union Union Council – November Referendum Meeting|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] conference at the end of 1967 he and David Adelstein, the Radicals leader from the [[London School of Economics]], were defeated in their quest for officership in the NUS. That was repeated in April 1968 when Straw stood for NUS President and was defeated by Trevor Fisk.&lt;ref&gt;''Student Power'' by Sir [[Patrick Wall]], MC, MP., [[Conservative Monday Club]], London, 1969, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 he succeeded in being elected President of the increasingly radical [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]], having led the campaign to remove the &quot;no politics&quot; clause from the NUS constitution.

He qualified as a barrister at [[Inns of Court School of Law]], practising [[criminal law]] from 1972 to 1974.

From 1971 to 1974 Jack Straw was a member of the [[Inner London Education Authority]] and Deputy Leader from 1973 to 1974. Straw contested [[Tonbridge and Malling (UK Parliament constituency)|Tonbridge and Malling]] constituency in [[Kent]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]]. 

Straw served as political adviser to [[Barbara Castle]] at the [[Department of Social Security]] from 1974 to 1976, and as adviser to [[Peter Shore]] at the [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Department for the Environment]] from 1976 to 1977. From 1977 to 1979, Straw worked as a researcher for the [[Granada TV]] series, ''[[World in Action]]''.

==Member of Parliament==
Straw was selected to stand for Parliament in [[Blackburn]], Lancashire, in 1977, after Barbara Castle (the incumbent) decided not to seek re-election. He won the seat in 1979 and has held it since, also becoming honorary president of [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. In the 1980s, he was an opposition spokesman on Treasury and economic affairs from 1980 to 1983, housing and local government from 1983 until promotion to the [[Shadow Cabinet]] in 1987.

===Shadow Cabinet===
Straw's first Shadow Cabinet post was as [[Secretary of State for Education|Education]] spokesman from 1987. In this role, he called on [[Local Education Authority|Local Education Authorities]] to give private Muslim and [[Orthodox Jewish]] schools the right to opt out of the state system and still receive public funds. He also stated that the schools should be free to enter the state system. His comments came at a time of great controversy regarding the funding of Muslim schools. Straw argued that the controversy arose out of ignorance and stereotyping about women's role in Islam, pointing out that Muslim women acquired property rights centuries before European women. Straw played a significant role in articulating the Labour Party's interest in and sensitivity to the issue.

Straw briefly served as Shadow [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Environment Secretary]] under [[John Smith (UK politician)|John Smith]] from 1992 to 1994, speaking on matters concerning local government. When [[Tony Blair]] became leader after Smith's death, he chose Straw to succeed him as Shadow [[Home Secretary]]. Like Blair, Straw believed Labour's electoral chances had been damaged in the past by the party appearing to be &quot;soft on crime&quot; and he developed a reputation as being even more authoritarian than the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Home Secretary [[Michael Howard]]. Straw garnered particular attention for comments condemning &quot;aggressive beggars, winos and squeegee merchants&quot; and calling for a curfew on children.

===Home Secretary===
Appointed as [[Home Secretary]] after the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], he brought forward the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]], increased police powers against terrorism and proposed to remove the right to trial by jury in certain cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/527721.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Straw on trial over jury reform | date=19 November 1999 | accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These policies won praise from [[Margaret Thatcher]] who once declared &quot;I would trust Jack Straw's judgement. He is a very fair man.&quot; They were deemed excessively authoritarian by his former students' union, which in 2000 banned him from the building—a policy which lapsed in 2003. However, he also incorporated the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] into British law, finalising the ''de jure'' abolition of the [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|death penalty]]. 

On 31 July 1997, Straw ordered a [[public inquiry]], to be conducted by [[William Macpherson (judge)|Sir William Macpherson]] and officially titled &quot;The Inquiry Into The Matters Arising From [[Murder of Stephen Lawrence|The Death Of Stephen Lawrence]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;inquiry letter&quot;&gt;[http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm42/4262/sli-pre.htm Cover letter upon completion of inquiry]&lt;/ref&gt; Its report, produced in February 1999, estimated that it had taken &quot;more than 100,000 pages of reports, statements, and other written or printed documents&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm42/4262/sli-02.htm Report, ch.2, para 2.9]&lt;/ref&gt; and concluded that the original [[Metropolitan Police Service]] investigation had been incompetent and that officers had committed fundamental errors, including: failing to give [[first aid]] when they reached the scene; failing to follow obvious leads during their investigation; and failing to arrest suspects. The report found that there had been a failure of leadership by senior MPS officers and that recommendations of the 1981 [[Scarman Report]], compiled following [[1981 England riots|race-related riots]] in [[Brixton]] and [[Toxteth]], had been ignored and concluded that the force was &quot;[[Institutional racism|institutionally racist]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lawrence Inquiry&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir William Macpherson’s Inquiry Into The Matters Arising From the Death of Stephen Lawrence|publisher=Official Documents Archive|url=http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm42/4262/sli-00.htm|date=24 February 1999|accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;br /&gt;(see also summary: {{cite news|title=Lawrence: Key recommendations |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/285537.stm|accessdate=5 January 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=24 March 1999}})&lt;/ref&gt; It also recommended that the [[double jeopardy]] rule should be [[Repeal|abrogated]] in murder cases to allow a retrial upon new and compelling evidence; [[Criminal Justice Act 2003|this became law]] in 2005. Straw commented in 2012 that ordering the inquiry was &quot;the single most important decision I made as Home Secretary&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Justice at last for Stephen Lawrence|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/crime/article3275748.ece|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Home Secretary, Straw was also involved in changing the [[electoral system]] for the [[European Parliament elections]] from plurality to [[proportional representation]]. In doing so, he advocated the use of [[D'Hondt method|d'Hondt]] formula as being the one that produces the most proportional outcomes. The d'Hondt formular, however, is less proportional to the [[Sainte-Laguë]] formula which was proposed by the [[Liberal Democrats]]. Straw later apologised to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] for his misleading comments,&lt;ref&gt;McLean, Iain and Johnston, Ron (2009) 'When is proportional not proportional? Great Britain's 2009 elections to the European Parliament', ''Representation'', 45: 351.&lt;/ref&gt; but the d'Hondt formula stayed in place.

In March 2000, Jack Straw was responsible for allowing General [[Augusto Pinochet]] to return to [[Chile]]. There were requests from several countries for Pinochet to be extradited and face trial for crimes against humanity. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain while appealing the legal authority of the Spanish and British courts to try him, but Straw eventually ordered his release on medical grounds before a trial could begin, and Pinochet returned to Chile.

Also in 2000, Straw turned down an asylum request from a man fleeing [[Human rights in Saddam Hussein's Iraq|Saddam Hussein's regime]], stating &quot;we have faith in the integrity of the [[Iraq]]i judicial process and that you should have no concerns if you haven’t done anything wrong.&quot;&lt;ref name='N000100'&gt;{{cite news | first=Noam | last=Chomsky |authorlink= Noam Chomsky | title=Iconoclast and Radical Who Takes the Long View – Noam Chomsky interviewed by Denis Staunton | date=21 January 2006 | url =http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20060121.htm |work=The Irish Times  | accessdate =22 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the last Home Secretary to have all the traditional powers of that office, as following the 2001 general election, the government began transferring all non-law and order responsibilities to other departments.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

===Foreign Secretary===
[[Image:Jack Straw and Rice.jpg|thumb|250px|Straw appears at a press conference with [[United States Secretary of State]], [[Condoleezza Rice]]]]
He was instead appointed Foreign Secretary in 2001 to succeed [[Robin Cook]]. Within months, Straw was confronted by the [[11 September attacks]] in the United States. He was initially seen as taking a back seat to [[Tony Blair]] in the UK Government's prosecution of the [[war on terror|&quot;war against terrorism&quot;]].

In 2003 the governments of the USA and UK agreed a new Extradition Treaty between them, intended to speed up extradition of terrorist suspects. The provisions of the treaty were enacted in the [[Extradition Act 2003]]. The treaty later attracted controversy with opponents alleging it to be one-sided: a British request to the USA needed to provide a ''prima facie'' case against a suspect while a US request to Britain needed only to provide reasonable suspicion for an arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/law/article2214834.ece |work=The Times |location=London  | title=Onesided treaty was meant to handle terrorist suspects | first=Michael | last=Binyon | date=28 June 2006 | accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been a series of causes célèbres involving the treaty, including the [[NatWest Three]] who later pleaded guilty to fraud against the US parent company of their employers, and [[Gary McKinnon]] who admitted hacking US defence computers. An inquiry into extradition arrangements by retired Judge Sir [[Scott Baker (judge)|Scott Baker]] reported in September 2011 that the treaty was not unbalanced and &quot;there is no practical difference between the information submitted to and from the 
United States&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/police/operational-policing/extradition-review?view=Binary |title=A Review of the United Kingdom's Extradition Arrangements |publisher=Home Office |accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to ''[[The Independent]]'' in 2004, he claimed that [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] &quot;can usually now be found in [[City of London|the City]], appearing on quiz shows or ranting in certain national newspapers,&quot; and recommended ''[[&quot;Left-Wing&quot; Communism: An Infantile Disorder]]'' by [[Vladimir Lenin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/letters/bbc-fights-for-the-arts-celebrity-help-for-starving-people-and-others-533363.html|title=Not a Trot|work=The Independent |location=London  | date=16 November 2004 | accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2004 Equatorial Guinea coup d'état attempt]], Jack Straw was personally informed months in advance of the plans for the takeover attempt and failed to accomplish the duty under international law of alerting the country's government. The involvement of British oil companies in the funding of the coup d'état, and the changing of British citizens evacuation plans for [[Equatorial Guinea]] before the attempt, posed serious challenges for the alleged ignorance of the situation. Later on, British officials and Jack Straw were forced to apologise to ''[[The Observer]]'' after categorically denying they had prior knowledge of the coup plot.&lt;ref name='GStraw2'&gt;{{cite news | title= How much did Straw know and when did he know it? | url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/equatorialguinea/story/0,,1361326,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London | accessdate =22 August 2007  | first=Antony | last=Barnett | date=28 November 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='GTold'&gt;{{cite news | title= Revealed: how Britain was told full coup plan | date= 28 November 2004| url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/politics/story/0,6903,1361299,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London | accessdate =22 August 2007  | first=Antony | last=Barnett }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='MP'&gt;{{cite news | title= Equatorial Guinea | url =http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo041109/text/41109w21.htm#41109w21.html_spnew5 | work=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] | accessdate =22 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the run up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]] Straw faced a potential backlash from his Muslim constituents over the Iraq War – the [[Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK]] (MPAC) attempted to capitalise on anti-war sentiment with 'operation Muslim vote' in Blackburn. In addition, [[Craig Murray]], who had been pushed out of his job as ambassador to [[Uzbekistan]], stood against his former boss (Straw was head of the FCO) on a platform opposing the use of information gathered under torture in the &quot;War on Terror&quot;. Straw's vote fell by 20% compared to the previous general election in 2001 (21,808 to 17,562) although the multiplicity of anti-Straw candidates makes it difficult to discern whether this was a particularly poor result for Straw and Labour. The swing to the second placed Conservatives was less than 2%, much lower than the national average. In any event, Straw was re-elected, while Murray trailed a distant fifth – barely managing to scrape the 5% of the vote necessary to retain his deposit and polling fewer votes than the BNP.  Speaking moments after his re-election during the BBC's election night coverage, Straw called MPAC an 'egregious group' and expressed disappointment at its campaign tactics, which he saw as overly aggressive. Straw enjoys a reputation for involved local campaigning in his constituency despite his cabinet post, often spending many hours in the run up to elections literally standing on a soapbox in a high street area taking questions from the crowd and responding to criticism with a microphone.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

In 2005 Jack Straw was heckled by Walter Wolfgang, a German Jew who had suffered persecution under the Nazis. The 82 year old man was 'bounced' out of the 2005 Labour Conference because he had heckled the then Foreign Secretary. The party chairman, Ian McCartney, later withdrew his hostility towards the octogenarian and apologised, and PM Tony Blair stated that he should not have been removed.

On 13 October 2005 Straw took questions from a public panel of (mostly anti-war) {{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} individuals in a BBC ''[[Newsnight]]'' television special on the subject of Iraq, addressing widespread public concerns about the [[exit strategy]] for British troops, the Iraqi insurgency and, inevitably, the moral legitimacy of the war. On several occasions Straw reiterated his position that the decision to invade was in his opinion the right thing to do, but said he did not 'know' for certain that this was the case. He said he understood why public opinion on several matters might differ from his own—a Newsnight/ICM poll showed over 70% of respondents believed the war in Iraq to have increased the likelihood of terrorist attacks in Britain, but Straw said he could not agree based on the information presented to him.

In February 2006, Straw attracted publicity after he condemned the publication of [[Jyllands-Posten Mohammad cartoons controversy|cartoons picturing Mohammed]] in the Danish newspaper ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;www_cbsnews_com1&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/02/03/world/main1277068_page2.shtml | title =U.S.: Muhammad Cartoon 'Offensive'|publisher=[[CBS news]]|accessdate =18 June 2007 | date=3 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in April 2006, reports of secret White House plans to target Iranian nuclear installations with bunker busting nuclear bombs was described by Jack Straw as &quot;completely nuts&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

In August 2006, it was claimed by [[William Rees-Mogg]] in ''[[The Times]]'' that there was evidence that Straw was removed from this post upon the request of the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]], possibly owing to his expressed opposition to bombing [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,6-2301799,00.html|title=How the US fired Jack Straw|work=The Times |location=London |date=7 August 2006|accessdate=14 August 2006  | first=William | last=Rees-Mogg}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be ironic, as [[Richard Ingrams]] in ''[[The Independent]]'' wondered whether Straw's predecessor as Foreign Secretary, [[Robin Cook]], was also removed at Bush's request,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/columnists/richard-ingrams/richard-ingramss-week-was-cook-sacked-on-the-orders-of-george-bush-1876433.html |work=The Independent |location=London  | title=Richard Ingrams's Week: Was Cook sacked on the orders of George Bush? | date=23 January 2010 | accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing Straw to become Foreign Secretary in the first place. It has also been alleged that another factor in Straw's dismissal was the large number of Muslims amongst his Blackburn constituents, supposedly considered a cause for concern by the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1839938,00.html|title=With extreme prejudice|publisher=[[Guardian Online]] | location=London | first=John | last=Williams | date=9 August 2006 | accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Iranian dissidents mocked Straw as &quot;Ayatollah Straw&quot; after his frequent visits to [[Tehran]] in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;www_iranfocus_com2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iranfocus.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=89 | title = Teheran two-times Straw by backing both sides|publisher=[[Iran Focus]]|accessdate=18 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Straw gave evidence to the [[Iraq Inquiry]] on 21 January 2010, making him the second member of Tony Blair's cabinet to do so. He told the inquiry that the decision to go to war in Iraq had &quot;haunted him&quot; and that it was the &quot;most difficult decision&quot; of his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iraq Inquiry&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8471511.stm|title=Straw says Iraq 'most difficult decision' in his life|date=21 January 2010|work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that he could have stopped the invasion, had he wanted to.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stopped war&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6996895.ece|title=I could have stopped Blair on Iraq, Jack Straw admits|date=22 January 2010|work=The Times |location=London |work=The Times |location=UK|accessdate=29 March 2010  | first=David | last=Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leader of the House of Commons===
After the Labour Party suffered major defeats in local elections on 4 May 2006, losing 317 seats in balloting for 176 councils, Tony Blair acted the following day with a [[UK Cabinet reshuffle, May 2006|major reshuffle]] of his ministers during which he moved Straw from Foreign Secretary to [[Leader of the House of Commons]] and [[Lord Privy Seal]]. Straw had apparently requested a break from high ministerial office after serving in two of the four great departments of state for nearly ten years. Straw's close relationship with US Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] was said to have 'infuriated' [[10 Downing Street|Number 10]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} with particular reference to her visit to Straw's Blackburn constituency which caused significant organisational difficulties. It is believed that Straw's public opposition to potential military actions in Iran during his tenure as Foreign Secretary was one of the main reasons behind his demotion.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} To lessen the apparent demotion, Blair gave Straw responsibility for House of Lords reform and party funding, issues which had been part of the portfolio of the [[Department for Constitutional Affairs]]. In addition, Straw was given the chairmanship of the Constitutional Affairs cabinet committee where he was responsible for attempting to force through a flat-fee charge for Freedom of Information requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clarke sacked in major cabinet reshuffle |url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labour/story/0,,1768251,00.html|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=5 May 2006|accessdate=5 May 2006  | first=Oliver | last=King}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 March 2007, Straw announced he was to run Gordon Brown's campaign for the Labour leadership. This was the first official confirmation the Chancellor would stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Straw to run Brown leadership bid|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6492417.stm|publisher=BBC News |date=25 March 2007|accessdate=25 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2006 debate over veils====
{{Main|British debate over veils}}
In October 2006 Straw attracted controversy by suggesting to a local newspaper, ''The Lancashire Evening Telegraph'' (now ''[http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/ The Lancashire Telegraph]''), that [[Women and Islam|Muslim women]] who wear veils that cover their faces (the ''[[niqab]]'') can inhibit inter-community relations, though he denied the issue was raised for political gain, stating that he had raised it in private circles in the past and it had never progressed beyond discussions. Although he did not support a law banning a woman's right to choose to wear the veil, he would like them to abandon it altogether. Asked whether he would prefer veils to be abolished completely, Straw said: &quot;Yes. It needs to be made clear I am not talking about being prescriptive but with all the caveats, yes, I would rather.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5413470.stm In quotes: Jack Straw on the veil] – BBC News. 6 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He said that he had asked women visiting his [[surgery (politics)|constituency surgeries]] to consider uncovering their noses and mouths in order to allow better communication. He claimed that no women had ever chosen to wear a full-veil after this request.&lt;ref name=&quot;www_blackburncitizen_co_uk3&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.blackburncitizen.co.uk/news/newsheadlines/display.var.954145.0.straw_in_plea_to_muslim_women_take_off_your_veils.php | title = Straw in plea to Muslim women: Take off your veils| accessdate =18 June 2007 | publisher=The Blackburn, Darwen And Hyndburn Citizen }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;www_gm_tv4&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gm.tv/index.cfm?articleid=22773 | title = Muslim veil row|publisher=[[GMTV]]|accessdate=18 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5410472.stm|publisher=BBC News |title=''Straw's veil comments spark anger'' | date=5 October 2006 | accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, given that he is known to suffer from [[tinnitus]] (which compromises the ability to hear), it is possible that he requested the veil to be removed so that he could lip-read the woman.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Straw's comments kicked off a wide-ranging and sometimes harshly worded debate within [[British politics]] and the media; Straw was supported by some establishment figures and castigated by others, including Muslim groups. There is [[Hijab#Dress code required by hijab|an ongoing debate]] within the [[Muslim community]] whether the [[Qur'an]] and ''[[hadith]]'' (traditions of [[Muhammad]]) require the use of the full face veil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/05/europe_muslim_veils/html/1.stm Different hijabs]&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Straw apologised for these comments regarding the veil on 26 April 2010 at a private hustings organised by [[Engage (organisation)|Engage]] in the build up to the [[United Kingdom General Election, 2010]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iengage.org.uk/component/content/article/1-news/861-jack-straw-apologises-for-his-anti-niqab-comments-at-engage-hustings-in-blackburn]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice===
[[Image:Canvassing.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Straw [[canvassing]] with local councillors in [[Blackburn]].]]
Straw was appointed [[Lord Chancellor|Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain]] and [[Secretary of State for Justice]] on the first full day of Gordon Brown's ministry, 28 June 2007. He was the first Lord Chancellor since the sixteenth century to serve in the role whilst a member of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. His appointment meant that he continued to be a major figure in the Labour Government. Only Straw, Brown and [[Alistair Darling]] served in the cabinet continuously during Labour's 13 year administration from 1997 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jul/28/jackstraw.gordonbrown |title=Clutching at Straw |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=28 July 2008 |accessdate=14 September 2009  | first=Martin | last=Kettle}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In February 2009, Straw used his authority as [[Secretary of State for Justice|Justice Secretary]] to veto publication of government documents requested under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]]: in particular, those pertaining to early government meetings concerning the (forthcoming) Iraq War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7907991.stm|title=Straw vetoes Iraq minutes release|author=BBC News|date=25 February 2009|publisher=BBC News  | accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Straw represented the government on a [[Question Time British National Party controversy|controversial edition of ''Question Time'']] on 22 October 2009, against [[British National Party]] leader [[Nick Griffin]] on his first ever appearance. Griffin's first comment was to attack Straw's father's wartime record, to general disdain. As Griffin claimed that European laws prevented him from explaining his stance on [[holocaust denial]] Straw later offered his personal assurance as Justice Secretary, which Griffin declined.

====Alleged ambitions for premiership====
When asked during an interview in February 2009 about becoming Prime Minister, Straw said: &quot;If someone came and said &quot;Sign on the dotted line&quot;, yes, I'd sign. But if you ask me have I yearned for it? No.&quot;  When pressed further he responded: &quot;I can honestly say I have no ambitions in that area.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1156729/Confessions-great-survivor-Jack-Straw-talks-really-thought-Blair-sacked-him.html &quot;Confessions of the great survivor: Jack Straw talks  about what he really thought when Blair sacked him&quot;], ''The Daily Mail'', 26 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' reported this with the headline: 'Straw: I'm ready for PM's job'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article2282146.ece], ''thesun.co.uk'', 28 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====Expenses claims====
{{Main|List of expenses claims in the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal}}
On checking his expenses claims prior to publication, Jack Straw found that he had over-claimed for four consecutive years as he had not spotted that he was actually paying 50% for council tax not the full amount. He duly voluntarily paid the amount back while adding in a  handwritten note to the Commons authorities that &quot;accountancy does not appear to be my strongest suit&quot;.&lt;ref name=bbckeydetails&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8039273.stm |title=MPs' expenses claims – key details |publisher=BBC News  |accessdate=13 May 2009 | date=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rayner |first=Gordon |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5293369/Jack-Straw-apologises-for-bungling-claim-MPs-expenses.html |title=Daily Telegraph: Jack Straw |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=8 May 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement from front-bench politics===
In August 2010, Straw announced his plans to quit his role as Shadow Justice Secretary and move to the backbenches, citing the need for a ‘fresh start’ for the Labour Party under a new leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-quit-frontbench&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-10895326|title=Jack Straw to quit Labour front bench|last=Mendonca|first=Susan|date=6 August 2010|work=BBC News |accessdate=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, ahead of the [[United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011|UK Alternative Vote Referendum 2011]], Straw was a signatory to a letter to [[the Guardian]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/dec/08/labour-yes-to-av Labour's yes to AV], The Guardian, 8 December 2010&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; arguing in favour of the [[alternative vote]].

In January 2011, Straw provoked controversy with comments made on ''[[Newsnight]]'' about Pakistani men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-12141603] Jack Straw: Some white girls are 'easy meat' for abuse&lt;/ref&gt; He said &quot;there is a specific problem which involves Pakistani heritage men ... who target vulnerable young white girls.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Batty|first=David|title=White girls seen as 'easy meat' by Pakistani rapists, says Jack Straw|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/08/jack-straw-white-girls-easy-meat|accessdate=8 January 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His comments came after two men of Pakistani origin were convicted of rape in [[Derby]].

In April 2011, Straw was appointed as a consultant to E. D. &amp; F. Man Holdings Ltd., a British company based in London specialising in the production and trading of commodities including sugar, molasses, animal feed, tropical oils, biofuels, coffee and financial services.  Commenting on his appointment to ED&amp;F Man on a salary of £30,000 per annum, Straw said, &quot;There are 168 hours in the week, and I will work in [[Blackburn]] for a least 60 and maybe sleep for 50. Providing there’s no conflict, I have long taken the view that I am not against people doing other things. I had two jobs as a minister. I think it’s really important that politicians are involved with the outside world.”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blackburn MP Jack Straw takes £30k consultancy role&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislancashire.co.uk/news/9000018.Blackburn_MP_Jack_Straw_takes___30k_consultancy_role/|title=Blackburn MP Jack Straw takes £30k consultancy role|last=Mosely|first=Tom|date=28 April 2011|work=This Is Lancashire|accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2011, Straw was also been appointed to the role of visiting professor to [[University College London]] School of Public Policy. He later argued for the abolition of the [[European Parliament]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/feb/21/european-parliament-abolish-jack-straw The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt; only to be rebuked by [[Simon Hix]] on the ground that the lack of accountability of British [[MEP]]s may have more to do with the British closed-list proportional [[electoral system]] than with the Parliament itself.&lt;ref&gt;[www.social-europe.eu/2012/03/why-the-european-parliament-should-not-be-abolished/ Social Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Straw's first marriage, in 1968, to teacher Anthea Weston ended in divorce in 1977. They had a daughter, Rachel, born on 24 February 1976,&lt;ref&gt;http://search.ancestry.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; who died after five days because of a heart defect.

On 10 November 1978 he married [[Alice Perkins]], a senior civil servant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1314756/Cabinet's-own-marriage-failures-force-retreat-on-traditional-wedlock.html|title=Cabinet's own marriage failures force retreat on traditional wedlock|author=Joe Murphy|date=19 June 2001|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=2 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 Straw's wife joined the board of the country's largest airports operator [[BAA plc|BAA]], shortly before it was taken over by the Spanish firm [[Ferrovial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2006/aug/20/businesscomment.theairlineindustry|title=Couldn't BAA have come up with a contingency plan?|author=Richard Wachman|date=20 August 2006|work=The Observer |location=London |accessdate=2 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have two children, William and Charlotte.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-profile&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/1999/jul/24/labour.jackstraw|title=Jack Straw: Jack of all tirades|author=Colin Hughes|date=24 July 1999|work=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir John Major''', {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of the Garter|KG]], [[Order of the Companions of Honour|CH]], [[Chartered Institute of Bankers|ACIB]]}} (born 29 March 1943) is a [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative]] politician, who served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leaders of the Conservative Party|Leader of the Conservative Party]] from 1990 to 1997. He held the posts of [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Thatcher ministry|Cabinet of]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] and was the [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] from [[UK general election, 1979|1979]] to [[UK general election, 2001|2001]].

Despite Thatcher's &quot;notorious&quot; assertion that &quot;she expected to continue in control as a backseat driver,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/major-has-every-right-to-shop-lady-thatcher-1112948.html|title=Major has every right to shop Lady Thatcher
|author=Malcolm Rifkind|publisher=Independent Newspapers|date=15 August 1999|accessdate=13 Narcg 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major's mild and consensual style was seen as complete contrast to Thatcher's forceful and confrontational manner. Early in his term, he presided over British participation in the First [[Gulf War]] (March 1991) and negotiated &quot;Game, Set and Match for Britain&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hansard |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1991/dec/11/european-council-maastricht |title=European Council (Maastricht) |publisher=Hansard |date=11 Dec 1991 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Maastricht Treaty]] (December 1991). Despite the British economy then being in recession he led the Conservatives to a fourth consecutive election victory, winning the most votes in British electoral history in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 general election]], albeit with a much reduced majority in the House of Commons. He is to date, the last Conservative leader to win an outright majority in a general election.

Major's premiership saw the world go through a period of political and military transition after the end of the [[Cold War]]. This included the growing importance of the [[European Union]], an issue which was already a source of friction within the Conservative Party owing to its importance in the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1990|decline and fall of Margaret Thatcher]]. Major and his government were responsible for the United Kingdom's exit from the [[Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) after ''[[Black Wednesday]]'' on 16 September 1992, after which his government never gained a lead in the opinion polls.

Despite successes such as the revival of economic growth and the beginnings of the [[Northern Ireland Peace Process]], by the mid-1990s the Conservatives were embroiled in ongoing &quot;sleaze&quot; scandals involving various MPs and even Cabinet Ministers. Criticism of Major's leadership reached such a pitch that he chose to resign, and be re-elected, as party leader in June 1995. By this time the &quot;New&quot; [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] was seen as a reformed and fresh alternative under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]], and after eighteen years in office the Conservatives lost the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]] in one of the worst electoral defeats since the [[Great Reform Act]] of 1832.

After the defeat, Major resigned as the leader of the party, and was succeeded by [[William Hague]]. He has since retired from active politics, leaving the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]], but continues to be a sought-after speaker.

==Early life==
Major was born at the [[St. Helier Hospital]] in [[London Borough of Sutton|Sutton]], Surrey, the son of Gwen Major and former [[Music Hall]] performer [[Tom Major-Ball]] (né Abraham Thomas Ball), who was 64 years old when John was born. He was christened as John Roy Major, but only &quot;John&quot; is shown on his [[birth certificate]]. He used his middle name Roy until the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/prime-ministers-in-history/john-major|title=John Major|work=History and Tour|publisher=[[10 Downing Street]]|accessdate=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended primary school at Cheam Common. From 1954, he attended [[Rutlish Grammar School]] in [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]]. In 1955, with his father's garden ornaments business in decline, the family moved to [[Brixton]]. The following year, Major watched his first debate in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] – Harold Macmillan's only budget – and has attributed his political ambitions to that event, and to a chance meeting with former Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] on the King's Road.

Major left school at age 16 in 1959, with three [[General Certificate of Education|O-levels]]: History, English Language, and English Literature. He later gained three more O-levels by [[Distance education|correspondence course]], in the [[British Constitution]], mathematics and economics. His first job was as a clerk in the insurance brokerage firm Pratt &amp; Sons in 1959. Disliking this job, he quit, and for a time he helped with his father's garden ornaments business along with his brother, [[Terry Major-Ball]]. Major joined the [[Young Conservatives]] in Brixton at this time.

Major was 19 years old when in 1962 his father died at the age of 83. His mother died eight years later at the age of 65.

After Major became prime minister, it was misreported that he had failed to get a job as a bus conductor because of failing a maths test, when in fact he passed all of the tests, but had been passed over for the job to another candidate owing to his height.&lt;ref&gt;Major, John (2000) John Major The Autobiography, p.30. HarperCollins, London. ISBN 0006530745.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seldon, Anthony (1998) Major – A Political Life, p.18. Phoenix, London. ISBN 0753801450.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a period of unemployment, Major started working at the [[London Electricity Board]] (where his successor as the Prime Minister, [[Tony Blair]], also worked when he was young) in 1963, and he decided to undertake a correspondence course in banking. Major took up a post as an executive at the [[Standard Chartered Bank]] in May 1965, and he rose quickly through the ranks. He was sent to work in [[Jos]], [[Nigeria]] by the bank in 1967, and he nearly died in a car accident there.&lt;ref&gt;Major, John (2000) John Major The Autobiography, p.35. HarperCollins, London. ISBN 0006530745&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==
Major was interested in politics from an early age. Encouraged by fellow conservative Derek Stone, he started giving speeches on a [[soapbox|soap-box]] in [[Brixton Market|Brixton market]]. He stood as a candidate for [[Lambeth London Borough Council]] at the age of 21 in 1964, and was unexpectedly elected in the Conservative landslide in 1968. While on the council he was Chairman of the Housing Committee, being responsible for the building of several [[council housing]] estates. Despite moving to a ward which was easier for the Conservatives to win, he lost his seat in May 1971.

Major was an active [[Young Conservatives|Young Conservative]] and according to his biographer [[Anthony Seldon]] brought &quot;youthful exuberance&quot; to the Tories in Brixton, but was often in trouble with the professional agent Marion Standing. Also according to Seldon, the formative political influence on Major was Jean Kierans, a divorcée 13 years his elder, who became his political mentor and his lover, too. Seldon writes &quot;She... made Major smarten his appearance, groomed him politically, and made him more ambitious and worldly.&quot; Their relationship lasted from 1963 to sometime after 1968.

Major stood for election to Parliament in [[St Pancras North (UK Parliament constituency)|St Pancras North]] in both general elections in 1974, but did not win this traditionally [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat. In November 1976, Major was selected by the [[Huntingdonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdonshire]] Conservatives as its candidate, winning the [[safe seat]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]]. Following boundary changes, Major became Member of Parliament (MP) for Huntingdon in 1983 and retained the seat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987]], [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]] general elections. His majority in 1992 was 36,230 votes, the largest in British electoral history. He stood down at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]].

==In the cabinet==

He was a [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] from 1981 and an [[whip (politics)|assistant whip]] from 1983. He was made [[Under-Secretary of State]] for Social Security in 1985 and became [[Minister of State]] in the same department in 1986, first attracting national media attention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deer|first=Brian|title=MINISTERS RIG 'COLD' CASH FOR OLD|url=http://briandeer.com/social/john-major.htm|work=The Sunday Times (London) January 11, 1987|publisher=The Sunday Times (London)|accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  over cold weather payments to the elderly in January 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard | house=House of Commons | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1987/jan/20/severe-weather-payments | date = January 20, 1987 | column_start = 747 | column_end = 754 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when Britain was in the depths of a severe winter.

Major entered the Cabinet as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]] in 1987, and in a surprise re-shuffle on 24 July 1989 a relatively inexperienced Major was appointed [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], succeeding [[Geoffrey Howe|Sir Geoffrey Howe]]. He spent only three months in that post before becoming [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] after [[Nigel Lawson]]'s resignation in October 1989. Major presented only one budget (the first one to be televised), in early 1990. He publicised it as ''a budget for savings'' and announced the [[Tax-Exempt Special Savings Account]] (TESSA), arguing that measures were required to address the marked fall in the household [[savings ratio]] that had been apparent during the previous [[Fiscal year|financial year]]. In June 1990 Major suggested that the proposed Single European Currency should be a &quot;hard ecu&quot;, competing for use against existing national currencies; this idea was not in the end adopted. In October 1990 Major and Douglas Hurd, Foreign Secretary, finally persuaded Thatcher to allow Britain to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism, a move which she had resisted for some years, and which had been a cause of her quarrels with Howe and Lawson.

When [[Michael Heseltine]] challenged [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1990|leadership of the Conservative Party in November 1990]], Major and [[Douglas Hurd]] were her proposer and seconder on her nomination papers. Major entered the contest alongside [[Douglas Hurd]] on 22 November after Thatcher abandoned her plans to contest the second ballot, ending her 11 years as prime minister and 15 years as party leader. Major was at home in Huntingdon recovering from a wisdom tooth operation at this time. Thatcher's nomination papers for the second ballot were sent to him by car for him to sign – it later emerged that he had signed both Thatcher's papers and a set of papers for his own candidacy in case she withdrew.

Though he fell two votes short of the required winning margin of 187 in the second ballot, the result was sufficient to secure immediate concessions from his rivals. He was named Leader of the Conservative Party on 27 November 1990, and was summoned to [[Buckingham Palace]] and appointed Prime Minister the following day.

===The Persian Gulf War===
Major was Prime Minister during the first [[Gulf War]] of 1991, and played a key role in persuading [[POTUS|US President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] to support [[no-fly zones]]. During the war Major and his Cabinet survived an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] assassination attempt by [[Downing Street mortar attack|mortar attack]].

===Soapbox election===
The economy had been sliding into recession during the final months of Thatcher's spell in power, and the recession deepened during 1991 and continued until the end of 1992. 

The Tories had slipped behind Labour in the opinion polls during 1989 and the gap widened during 1990, but within two months of Major taking over as prime minister the Tories had returned to the top of the opinion polls, briefly enjoying a comfortable lead after the Gulf War. Polls also showed that Major was the most popular prime minister in Britain since [[Harold Macmillan]] some 30 years previously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/673348.stm John Major: A life in politics], BBC News, 28 September 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and opposition leader [[Neil Kinnock]] made endless calls for a general election throughout 1991, but Major held out and decided not to call the election until he finally set an election date of 9 April 1992. During this time, the Tories and Labour had exchanged places at the top of the opinion polls on numerous occasions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8280050.stm|title=Poll tracker: Interactive guide to the opinion polls|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 March 2010 | date=29 September 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the time of the election most opinion polls were showing a slim Labour lead, which most observers predicted would translate into a [[hung parliament]] or a narrow Labour victory at the election.

Major took his campaign onto the streets, delivering many addresses from an upturned [[soapbox]] as in his Lambeth days. This approach stood in contrast to the Labour Party's seemingly slicker campaign and it chimed with the electorate, along with hard-hitting [[negative campaign]] advertising focusing on the issue of Labour's approach to taxation. Major won in excess of 14&amp;nbsp;million votes, the highest popular vote recorded by a British political party in a general election. However, this translated into a reduced majority of 21 seats, enough to form a practicable but small majority. The Tory election win led to the resignation of Neil Kinnock as Labour leader and the appointment of [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] as his successor.

===Black Wednesday===
{{Main|Black Wednesday}}

The Conservative majority proved too small for effective control over his backbenchers, particularly after the United Kingdom's forced exit from the [[Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) on &quot;[[Black Wednesday]]&quot;, 16 September 1992, just five months into the new parliament, when billions of pounds were spent in a futile attempt to defend the currency's value. After the release of Black Wednesday government documents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foi/story/0,,1409254,00.html|title=Treasury papers reveal cost of Black Wednesday |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 9 February 2005|accessdate=2 October 2006  | first=Matthew | last=Tempest}}&lt;/ref&gt; it became apparent that Major came very close to stepping down from office at this point, having even prepared an unsent letter of resignation addressed to the Queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1483186/Major-was-ready-to-quit-over-Black-Wednesday.html|title= Major was ready to quit over Black Wednesday|work=Daily Telegraph |location=London |date= 10 February 2005|accessdate=30 September 2009  | first1=Toby | last1=Helm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major continued to defend Britain's membership of the ERM, stating that &quot;The ERM was the medicine to cure the ailment, but it was not the ailment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Major, John (2000) John Major The Autobiography, p.341. HarperCollins, London. ISBN 0006530745.&lt;/ref&gt;

Major kept his economic team unchanged for seven months after Black Wednesday before he replaced [[Norman Lamont (1942)|Norman Lamont]] with [[Kenneth Clarke]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], after months of press criticism of Lamont and disastrous defeat at a by-election in Newbury. Such a delay, on top of the crisis, was exploited by Major's critics as proof of the indecisiveness that was to undermine his authority through the rest of his premiership. Britain's departure from the ERM led to a fall in the opinion poll ratings for the Conservative Party,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/historical-polls/voting-intention-1992-1997 |title=UK Polling Report |publisher=UK Polling Report |accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which despite the improvement in the economic position, did not fully recover whilst John Major was Prime Minister.

Within a year of Major's general election win, general public and media opinion of him had plummeted, with Black Wednesday, mine closures, the Maastricht dispute and mass unemployment being cited as four key areas of dissatisfaction with the prime minister. The newspapers which traditionally supported the Conservatives and had championed Major at the election were now being critical of him on an almost daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/leading-article-john-major-is-he-up-to-the-job-1453316.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=4 April 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK's forced withdrawal from the ERM was succeeded by a partial economic recovery with a new policy of flexible [[exchange rate]]s, allowing lower [[interest rate]]s and [[devaluation]] – increased demand for UK goods in export markets. The recession that had started just before Major came to office was declared over in April 1993, when the economy grew by 0.2%. Unemployment started to fall; by the start of 1993 it had reached almost 3,000,000, but by early 1997 it stood at 1,700,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503271.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &amp;#124; 26 &amp;#124; 1993: Recession over – it's official |publisher=BBC News  |date=26 April 1962 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/wanted-a-wartsandall-tally-of-uks-jobless-1316516.html |title=Wanted: a warts-and-all tally of UK's jobless – Business, News |work=The Independent |location=London |date=30 December 1996 |accessdate=17 April 2010  | first=John | last=Philpott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political infighting over Europe===
On becoming Prime Minister Major had promised to keep Britain &quot;at the very heart of Europe&quot;, and claimed to have won &quot;game, set and match for Britain&quot; – by negotiating the social chapter and single currency opt-outs from the [[Maastricht Treaty]], and by ensuring that there was no overt mention of a &quot;Federal&quot; Europe and that foreign and defence policy were kept as matters of inter-governmental cooperation, in separate &quot;pillars&quot; from the supranational European Union. By 2010 some of these concessions, but not Britain's non-membership of the Single Currency, had been overtaken by subsequent events.

However, even these moves towards greater European integration met with vehement opposition from the [[Eurosceptic]] wing of the party and the Cabinet as the Government attempted to ratify the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in the first half of 1993. Although the Labour opposition supported the treaty, they were prepared to tactically oppose certain provisions in order to weaken the government. This opposition included passing an amendment that required a vote on the social chapter aspects of the treaty before it could be ratified. Several Conservative MPs, known as the [[Maastricht Rebels]], voted against the treaty, and the Government was defeated. Major called another vote on the following day, 23 July 1993, which he declared a [[1993 vote of confidence in the government of John Major|vote of confidence]]. He won by 40 votes, but the damage had been done to his authority in parliament.

Later that day, Major gave an interview to [[ITN]]'s [[Michael Brunson]]. During an unguarded moment when Major thought that the microphones had been switched off, Brunson asked why he did not sack the ministers who were conspiring against him. He replied: &quot;Just think it through from my perspective. You are the prime minister, with a majority of 18... where do you think most of the poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. Do we want three more of the bastards out there? What's [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s maxim?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The maxim referred to is Johnson's famous comment about [[J. Edgar Hoover]]: Johnson had once sought a way to remove Hoover from his post as head of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), but upon realising that the problems involved in such a plan were insurmountable, he accepted Hoover's presence philosophically, reasoning that it would be &quot;better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside pissing in&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Major later said that he had picked the number three from the air and that he was referring to &quot;former ministers who had left the government and begun to create havoc with their anti-European activities&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Major, John (1999). ''Autobiography'', pp343-44.&lt;/ref&gt; but many journalists suggested that the three were [[Peter Lilley]], [[Michael Portillo]] and [[Michael Howard]], three of the more prominent &quot;[[Eurosceptic]]s&quot; within his Cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk|title=Major hits out at Cabinet|first1=Paul|last1=Routledge|first2=Simon|last2=Hoggart|work=[[The Observer]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |date=25 July 1993|accessdate=10 October 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the rest of Major's premiership the exact identity of the three was blurred, with [[John Redwood]]'s name frequently appearing in a list along with two of the others. The tape of this conversation was leaked to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and widely reported, embarrassing Major.

Arguments continued over Europe. Early in 1994 Major vetoed the Belgian politician [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] as President of the European Commission (in succession to [[Jacques Delors]]) for being excessively federalist, only to find that he had to accept a Luxembourg politician of similar views, [[Jacques Santer]], instead. Around this time Major – who in an unfortunate phrase denounced the Labour Leader John Smith as &quot;Monsieur Oui, the poodle of Brussels&quot; – tried to demand an increase in the Qualified Majority needed for voting in the newly-enlarged European Union (i.e. making it easier for Britain, in alliance with other countries, to block federalist measures). After Major had to back down on this issue [[Tony Marlow]] called openly in the House of Commons for his resignation. In 1996 European governments banned British beef over claims that it was infected with &quot;Mad Cow Disease&quot; – the British government withheld cooperation with the EU over the issue, but did not succeed in getting the ban lifted.

For the rest of Major's premiership the main argument was over whether Britain would join the planned European Single Currency. Some leading Conservatives (e.g. Chancellor Ken Clarke) favoured joining and insisted that Britain retain a completely free choice, whilst increasing numbers of others expressed their reluctance to join. By this time billionaire [[Sir James Goldsmith]] had set up his own Referendum Party, siphoning off some Conservative support, and at the 1997 General Election many Conservative candidates were openly expressing reluctance to join.

===&quot;Sleaze&quot;===
At the 1993 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Conference, Major began the &quot;[[Back to Basics (campaign)|Back to Basics]]&quot; campaign, which he intended to be about the economy, education, policing, and other such issues, but it was interpreted by many (including Conservative cabinet ministers) as an attempt to revert to the moral and [[family values]] that the Conservative Party were often associated with. &quot;Back to Basics&quot;, however, became synonymous with scandal, often exposed in lurid and embarrassing detail by [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid newspapers]] such as ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''. In 1992 [[David Mellor]], a cabinet minister, had been exposed as having an extramarital affair, and for accepting hospitality from the daughter of a leading member of the [[PLO]]. The wife of the [[Malcolm Sinclair, 20th Earl of Caithness|Earl of Caithness]] committed suicide amongst rumours of the Earl committing adultery. [[Stephen Milligan]] was found dead having apparently auto-asphyxiated whilst performing a solitary sex act (his Eastleigh seat was lost in what was to be an ongoing stream of hefty by-election defeats). [[David Ashby]] was 'outed' by his wife after sleeping with men. A string of other Conservative MPs, including [[Alan Amos]], [[Tim Yeo]] and [[Michael Brown (UK politician)|Michael Brown]], were involved in sexual scandals.

Other debilitating scandals included &quot;Arms to Iraq&quot; – the ongoing inquiry into how government ministers including [[Alan Clark]] (also involved in a unrelated scandal involving the revelation of his affair with the wife and both daughters of a South African judge) had encouraged businesses to supply arms to Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s, in breach of the official arms embargo, and how senior ministers had, on legal advice, attempted to withhold evidence of this official connivance when directors of Matrix Churchill were put trial for breaking the embargo.

Another scandal was &quot;[[Cash for Questions]]&quot;, in which first [[Graham Riddick]], and [[David Tredinnick (politician)|David Tredinnick]] accepted money to ask questions in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in a newspaper &quot;sting&quot;, and later [[Tim Smith (UK politician)|Tim Smith]] and [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]] were found to have received money from [[Mohamed Al Fayed]], also to ask questions in the [[British House of Commons|House]]. Later, [[David Willetts]] resigned as [[Paymaster General]] after he was accused of rigging evidence to do with ''Cash for Questions''.

Defence Minister [[Jonathan Aitken]] was accused by the [[ITV]] [[investigative journalism]] series ''[[World In Action]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper of secretly doing deals with leading Saudi princes. He denied all accusations and promised to wield the &quot;sword of truth&quot; in libel proceedings which he brought against ''The Guardian'' and the producers of ''World In Action'' [[Granada Television]]. At an early stage in the trial however, it became apparent that he had lied under oath, and he was subsequently (after the Major government had fallen from power) convicted of perjury and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.

Major attempted to draw some of the sting from the financial scandals by setting up public inquiries – the Nolan Report into standards expected in public life, and the Scott Report into the Arms to Iraq Scandal.

Although [[Tim Smith (UK politician)|Tim Smith]] stepped down from the House of Commons at the 1997 General Election, both [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]] and [[Jonathan Aitken]] sought re-election for their seats, and were both defeated, in Hamilton's case by the former BBC Reporter [[Martin Bell]], who stood as an anti-sleaze candidate, both the Labour and LibDem candidates withdrawing in his favour, amidst further publicity unfavourable to the Conservatives.

===Northern Ireland===
Major opened talks with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) upon taking office. When he declared to the House of Commons in November 1993 that &quot;to sit down and talk with [[Gerry Adams|Mr. Adams]] and the Provisional IRA... would turn my stomach&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199293/cmhansrd/1993-11-01/Debate-2.html|date=1 November 1993|column=34|house=House of Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sinn Féin]] gave the media an outline of the secret talks indeed held regularly since that February. The [[Downing Street Declaration]] was issued on 15 December 1993 by Major and [[Albert Reynolds]], the Irish [[Taoiseach]], with whom he had a friendly relationship: an IRA ceasefire followed in 1994. In the House of Commons Major refused to sign-up to the first draft of the &quot;[[George J. Mitchell|Mitchell]] Principles&quot;, which resulted in the ending of the ceasefire. Major paved the way for the [[Belfast Agreement]], also known as the 'Good Friday Agreement', which was signed after he left office.

In March 1995, Major refused to answer the phone calls of [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Bill Clinton]] for several days because of his anger at Clinton's decision to invite [[Gerry Adams]] to the [[White House]] for [[Saint Patrick's Day|St Patrick's Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1243638,00.html|title='Mandela helped me survive Monicagate, Arafat could not make the leap to peace – and for days John Major wouldn't take my calls'|work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 21 June 2004|accessdate=17 September 2006  | first=Alan | last=Rusbridger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bosnia===
Major's premiership saw the ongoing war in Bosnia. Government policy was to maintain the United Nations arms embargo which restricted the flow of weapons into the region and to oppose air strikes against Bosnian Serbs. The Government's reasoning was that an arms embargo would only create a 'level killing field' and that air strikes would endanger UN peacekeepers and the humanitarian aid effort. This policy was criticised by Thatcher and others who saw the Bosnian Muslims as the main victims of Serb aggression and compared the situation to events in WWII. The Clinton administration, by contrast, was committed to a policy of 'lift and strike' (lifting the arms embargo and inflicting air strikes on the Serbs) causing tensions in the 'special relationship' (Douglas Hurd and others strongly opposed this policy). 

Some commentators compared the Major Government's policy to 'amoral equivalency' because it appeared to judge the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs equally culpable.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&amp;reportid=163&lt;/ref&gt; To some extent these critics of Major's policy were vindicated when in an article published in 2011, the then Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind accepted that the arms embargo was a 'serious mistake' by the UN.&lt;ref&gt;http://greatersurbiton.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/sir-malcolm-rifkind-arms-embargo-on-bosnia-was-the-most-serious-mistake-made-by-the-un/&lt;/ref&gt;

===1995 leadership election===
On 22 June 1995, tired of continual threats of leadership challenges that never arose, Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party and announced he would contest the resulting [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1995|leadership election]] – he continued to serve as Prime Minister while the leadership was vacant, but would have resigned had he not been re-elected by a large enough majority. [[John Redwood]] resigned as [[Secretary of State for Wales]] to stand against him. Major won by 218 votes to Redwood's 89 (with 12 spoiled ballots, eight 'active' abstentions and two MPs abstaining), enough to win in the first round, but only three more than the target he had privately set himself.&lt;ref&gt;Major, John (1999). Autobiography&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, still at this stage supporting the Conservative Party, had lost faith in Major and declared its support for Redwood in the leadership election, running the front page headline &quot;Redwood versus Deadwood&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/pm-assails-malcontent-redwood-1588458.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Donald | last1=Macintyre | first2=Colin | last2=Brown | date=27 June 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1997 general election defeat===
Major's re-election as leader of the party failed to restore his authority. Despite efforts to restore (or at least improve) the popularity of the Conservative party, Labour remained far ahead in the opinion polls as the 1997 election loomed, despite the economic boom that had followed the exit from recession four years earlier, and the swift fall in unemployment. By December 1996 the Conservatives had lost their majority in the House of Commons. Major managed to survive to the end of the Parliament, but called an election on 17 March 1997 as the five-year limit for its timing approached. Major delayed the election in the hope that a still improving economy would help the Conservatives win a greater number of seats, but it did not.

Few then were surprised when Major's Conservatives lost the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1 May 1997 general election]] to [[Tony Blair]]'s &quot;[[New Labour]]&quot;, although the immense scale of the defeat was not as widely predicted: in 1987 and 1992 the Conservatives had polled better than had been suggested by the opinion polls, but in 1997 this was no longer the case. In the event the Conservative party suffered the worst electoral defeat by a ruling party since the [[Great Reform Act]] of 1832. In the new parliament, Labour held 418 seats, the Conservatives 165, and the Liberal Democrats 46, giving Labour a majority of 179. Major himself was re-elected in his own constituency of Huntingdon with a majority of 18,140. However, 179 other Conservative MPs were defeated, including present and former Cabinet ministers such as [[Norman Lamont (1942)|Norman Lamont]], [[Sir Malcolm Rifkind]] and [[Michael Portillo]]. The election defeat also meant that the Tories were left without any MPs in Scotland or Wales, failing to win a single seat outside England.

At about noon on 2 May 1997, Major officially returned his seals of office as Prime Minister to [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]]. Shortly before his resignation, he gave his final statement from [[10 Downing Street]], in which he said; &quot;When the curtain falls, it is time to get off the stage&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=&quot;http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page824.html&quot;|title=Mr Major’s Resignation Statement|date=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major then famously announced to the press that he intended to go with his family to [[The Oval]] to watch [[cricket]]. Following his resignation as Prime Minister, Major briefly became [[Leader of the Opposition (UK)|Leader of the Opposition]], and [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] (as [[Sir Malcolm Rifkind]], who was Foreign Secretary prior to the election, had lost his seat), and remained in this post until the election of [[William Hague]] as leader of the Conservative Party in June 1997. His [[1997 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours|Resignation Honours]] were announced in August 1997.

Major retired from the House of Commons at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]], made public on the Breakfast show with [[David Frost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/breakfast_with_frost/962625.stm |title=Interview on ''Breakfast With Frost'' |publisher=BBC News  |date=8 October 2000 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summary===
Major's mild-mannered style and moderate political stance made him theoretically well-placed to act as a conciliatory leader of his party. However, conflict raged within the Conservative Party, particularly over the extent of Britain's integration with the [[European Union]]. Major never succeeded in reconciling the &quot;Euro-rebels&quot; among his MPs to his European policy, who although relatively few in number - although their views were much more widely supported amongst Conservative activists and voters - wielded great influence because of his small majority, and episodes such as the [[Maastricht Rebels|Maastricht Rebellion]] inflicted serious political damage on him and his government. During the 1990s, the bitterness on the right wing of the Conservative Party at the manner in which [[Margaret Thatcher]] had been removed from office did not make Major's task any easier. A series of scandals among leading Tory MP's also did Major and his government no favours. His task became even more difficult after the well-received election of [[Tony Blair]] as [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] leader in July 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7593554.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Who has been UK's greatest post-war PM? | date=16 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, it was during Major's premiership that the British economy recovered from the recession of 1990–1992. John Major wrote in his auto-biography that, &quot;During my premiership interest rates fell from 14% to 6%; unemployment was at 1.75&amp;nbsp;million when I took office, and at 1.6&amp;nbsp;million and falling upon my departure; and the government's annual borrowing rose from [[pound sterling|£]]0.5&amp;nbsp;billion to nearly £46&amp;nbsp;billion at its peak before falling to £1&amp;nbsp;billion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Major, John (2000) John Major The Autobiography, p.689. HarperCollins, London. ISBN 0006530745.&lt;/ref&gt;

The former Labour MP [[Tony Banks, Baron Stratford|Tony Banks]] said of Major in 1994 that &quot;He was a fairly competent chairman of Housing on Lambeth Council. Every time he gets up now I keep thinking, 'What on earth is Councillor Major doing?' I can't believe he's here and sometimes I think he can't either.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,1682818,00.html|title=The Right Hon wag|date= 10 January 2006|accessdate=17 September 2006|work=The Guardian |location=London  | first=Iain | last=Dale}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paddy Ashdown]], the leader of the [[Liberal Democrats]] during Major's term of office, once described him in the House of Commons as a &quot;decent and honourable man&quot;. Few observers doubted that he was an honest man, or that he made sincere and sometimes successful attempts to improve life in Britain and to unite his deeply divided party. He was also, however, perceived as a weak and ineffectual figure {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}, and his approval ratings for most of his time in office were low, particularly after &quot;[[Black Wednesday]]&quot; in September 1992. Conversely on occasions he attracted criticism {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} for dogmatically pursuing schemes favoured by the right of his party, notably the privatisation of [[British Rail]], and for closing down most of the coal industry in advance of privatisation.

Since leaving office Major has maintained a low profile, indulging his love of cricket as president of [[Surrey County Cricket Club]] until 2002 (and Honorary Life Vice-President since 2002)&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceWho2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Who's Who|title=Who's Who 2011|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7IIWRQAACAAJ|accessdate=7 May 2011|date=15 February 2011|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781408128565}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commentating on political developments in the manner of a wise elder statesman.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} He has been a member of [[Carlyle Group]]'s European Advisory Board since 1998 and was appointed Chairman of Carlyle Europe in May 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecarlylegroup.com/eng/news/l5-news716.html |title=John Major appointed European Chairman of the Carlyle Group |date=14 May 2001  |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030813221404/http://www.thecarlylegroup.com/eng/news/l5-news716.html |archivedate=13 August 2003]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stood down in August 2004.

Unlike most former prime ministers up until that time, Major turned down a [[peerage]]{{citation}} when he retired from the House of Commons in 2001. In recent history, only [[Winston Churchill|Sir Winston Churchill]], [[Sir Edward Heath]], [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]] have not been elevated to the [[House of Lords]].

In March 2001, he gave the tribute to [[Colin Cowdrey]] (Lord Cowdrey of Tonbridge) at his memorial service in [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/1250896.stm |title=Cowdrey remembered |publisher=BBC News  |date=30 March 2001 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 he was elected to the Committee of the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC), historically the governing body of the sport, and still guardian of the laws of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Website by the OTHER media |url=http://www.lords.org/mcc/committee/ |title=MCC Committee 2006–07 |publisher=Lords.org |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] in 1997, Major was appointed a special guardian to Princes [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|William]] and [[Prince Harry of Wales|Harry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/apr/24/royal-wedding-guest-list-invitations |title=Royal wedding guest list includes friends, family – and a few dictators |work=Guardian |location=London |date=24 April 2011 |accessdate=24 April 2010  |first=Stephen |last=Bates}}&lt;/ref&gt; with responsibility for legal and administrative matters.

===Major/Currie affair===
Major's low profile in retirement was disrupted by [[Edwina Currie]]'s revelation in September 2002 that, prior to his promotion to the Cabinet, Major had had a four-year [[extramarital affair]] with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2286008.stm |title=Major and Currie had four-year affair |publisher=BBC News  |date=28 September 2002 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,801852,00.html |title=The Major-Currie affair – what the papers say |work=Guardian |location=London |date= 30 September 2002|accessdate=17 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators were quick to refer to Major's previous &quot;Back to Basics&quot; platform to throw charges of [[hypocrisy]]. He had also sued two magazines, [[New Statesman|New Statesman and Society]] and [[Scallywag (magazine)|Scallywag]] plus their distributors, in 1993 for reporting rumours of an affair with a caterer, even though at least one of the magazines had said that the rumours were false. Both considered legal action to recover their costs when the affair with Currie was revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2286916.stm |title=Major faces legal action over affair |publisher=BBC News  |date=29 September 2002 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press statement, Major said that he was &quot;ashamed&quot; by the affair and that his wife had forgiven him. In response, Currie said &quot;he wasn't ashamed of it at the time and he wanted it to continue.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2291467.stm |title=Currie interview in full |publisher=BBC News  |date=2 October 2002 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 2005===

In February 2005, it was reported that Major and [[Norman Lamont (1942)|Norman Lamont]] delayed the release of papers on [[Black Wednesday]] under the [[Freedom of information legislation|Freedom of Information Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4248855.stm |title=Treasury releases 1992 ERM papers |publisher=BBC News  |date=9 February 2005 |accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major denied doing so, saying that he had not heard of the request until the scheduled release date and had merely asked to look at the papers himself. He told [[BBC News]] that he and Lamont had been the victims of &quot;whispering&quot; to the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4238937.stm |title=Major denies blocking ERM papers |publisher=BBC News  |date=5 February 2005 |accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later publicly approved the release of the papers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article511715.ece/ Major permits release of Black Wednesday papers]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Evening Standard]]'', Major has become a prolific [[after dinner speaker|after-dinner speaker]]. He earns over £25,000 per engagement for his &quot;insights and his own opinions on the expanding European Union, the future of the world in the 21st century, and also about Britain&quot;, according to his agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article2300374.ece |title= Forty million dollar Bill: Earning power of an ex-leader |date= 24 February 2007 |work=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=28 June 2007 |first=Daniel |last=Bentley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, Major led calls for an independent inquiry into Tony Blair's decision to [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invade Iraq]], following revelations made by [[Carne Ross]], a former British senior diplomat, that contradict Blair's case for the invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article2079340.ece|title=John Major leads calls for inquiry into conflict|date=16 December 2006|work=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=17 December 2006  | first1=Colin | last1=Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was touted as a possible Conservative candidate for the [[Mayor of London]] [[London mayoral election, 2008|elections in 2008]], but turned down an offer from Conservative leader [[David Cameron]]. A spokesperson for Major said &quot;his political career is behind him&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article1717355.ece|title=Cameron snubbed again as Major rules out mayor race|date=28 April 2007|work=The Times |location=London |accessdate=3 May 2008  | first=Philip | last=Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Major became a key loyalist to the [[United Kingdom coalition government (2010–present)|Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition]], and said that he hoped for a &quot;liberal conservative&quot; alliance beyond 2015, and has criticised [[Ed Miliband]] and the Labour Party, for &quot;party games&quot; rather than helping in the national interest.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News Website, 'Ed Miliband asks Lib Dems to help draw up Labour policy', 13 Dec 10 [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11981011]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was among the guests at the [[Wedding of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine Middleton|Royal Wedding]] of [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] to [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Catherine Middleton]] at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 29 April 2011. [[Margaret Thatcher|Baroness Thatcher]] was also invited but declined to attend due to ill health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/royal-wedding/8482346/Royal-wedding-Tony-Blair-not-offended-by-lack-of-invite.html|title=Royal Wedding: Tony Blair not offended by lack of invite|work=Telegraph|accessdate=9 May 2011]|location=London|first=James|last=Kirkup|date=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation in the media==
During his leadership of the Conservative Party, Major was portrayed as honest (&quot;Honest John&quot;) but unable to rein in the philandering and bickering within his party. Major's appearance was noted in its greyness, his prodigious [[philtrum]], and large glasses, all of which were exaggerated in caricatures. For example, in ''[[Spitting Image]]'', Major's puppet was changed from a circus performer to that of a grey man who ate dinner with his wife in silence, occasionally saying &quot;nice peas, dear&quot;, whilst at the same time nursing an unrequited crush on his colleague [[Virginia Bottomley]] – an invention, but an ironic one in view of his affair with [[Edwina Currie]], which was not then a matter of public knowledge. By the end of his premiership his puppet would often be shown observing the latest fiasco and murmuring &quot;Oh Dear&quot; in an ineffectual manner.

The media (particularly ''[[The Guardian]]'' cartoonist [[Steve Bell (cartoonist)|Steve Bell]]) used the allegation by [[Alastair Campbell]] that he had observed Major tucking his shirt into his underpants to [[caricature]] him wearing his pants outside his trousers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/cartoons/stevebell/0,MFEM,802577,00.html|title=
'If only we had known back then'|work=The Guardian |location=London |author=Steve Bell|authorlink=Steve Bell (cartoonist)|date= 1 October 2002|accessdate=17 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a pale grey echo of both [[Superman]] and [[Supermac (cartoon)|Supermac]], a parody of [[Harold Macmillan]]. Bell also used the humorous possibilities of the [[Cones Hotline]], a means for the public to inform the authorities of potentially unnecessary [[traffic cone]]s, which was part of the [[Citizen's Charter]] project established by John Major.

''[[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]]'' parodied [[Sue Townsend]]'s ''The Secret Diary of [[Adrian Mole]], age 13¾'' to write ''[[Prime Minister parodies (Private Eye)#John Major: The Secret Diary of John Major (aged 47¾)|The Secret Diary of John Major, age 47¾]]'', in which Major was portrayed as a naive nincompoop (e.g. keeping lists of his enemies in a Rymans Notebook called his &quot;Bastards Book&quot;) and featuring &quot;my wife Norman&quot; and &quot;[[Brian Mawhinney|Mr Dr Mawhinney]]&quot; as [[recurring character]]s. The magazine still runs one-off specials of this diary (with the age updated) on occasions when Major is in the news, such as on the breaking of the Edwina Currie story or the publication of his autobiography. The magazine also ran a series of cartoons called ''101 Uses for a John Major'' (based on a comic book of some ten years earlier, called ''[[101 Uses for a Dead Cat]]''), in which Major was illustrated serving a number of bizarre purposes, such as a train-spotter's anorak. &lt;!-- Reference at http://catalogue.bl.uk/F/LG58CGKV3EVJCXLYJJH461GPDNH8KSVKIKFX4YQHYNUQ6PT4BD-02109?func=full-set-set&amp;set_number=122950&amp;set_entry=000001&amp;format=999 requires sign-in --&gt;

Major's Brixton roots were used in a campaign poster during the Conservative Party's 1992 election campaign: &quot;What does the Conservative Party offer a working class kid from Brixton? They made him Prime Minister.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bennett |first=Gillian |year=1996 |title=&quot;Camera, Lights Action!&quot;: The British General Election 1992 as Narrative Event |journal=Folklore |volume=107 |pages=94–97 |id= |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/1260921 |accessdate=07 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major was often mocked for his nostalgic evocation of what sounded like the lost Britain of the 1950s (see [[Merry England]]).&lt;ref&gt;Page 29, John Major by Robert Taylor, Haus 2006&lt;/ref&gt; For example: &quot;Fifty years on from now, Britain will still be the country of long shadows on cricket grounds, warm beer, invincible green suburbs, dog lovers and pools fillers&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;Page 370, Major: A political life by Anthony Seldon, Weidenfield 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Major complained in his memoirs that these words (which drew upon a passage in the sociopolitical commentator and author [[George Orwell]]'s &quot;The Lion and the Unicorn&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.k-1.com/Orwell/site/work/essays/lionunicorn.htmlEssays |title=: The Lion and the Unicorn // George Orwell // www.k-1.com/Orwell |publisher=K-1.com |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) had been misrepresented as being more naive and romantic than he had intended{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}, and indeed his memoirs were dismissive of the common conservative viewpoint that there was once a time of moral rectitude; Major wrote that &quot;life has never been as simple as that&quot;.

Writing in 2011, the BBC's Home editor [[Mark Easton]] judged that &quot;Majorism&quot; had made little lasting impact.&lt;ref name=intro-cam&gt;{{cite news|last=Easton|first=Mark|title=Introducing Cameronism|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14115047|accessdate=11 July 2011|newspaper=BBC News UK|date=11 July 2011|authorlink=Mark Easton|quote=Majorism and [[Brownism]] are unconvincing stubs. History appears to have decided they may have re-upholstered the settee and scattered a few cushions but they didn't alter the [[feng shui]] of the room.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major's elder brother, [[Terry Major-Ball|Terry]], who died in 2007, became a minor media personality during Major's period in Downing Street, with an autobiography, Major Major. He also wrote newspaper columns, and appeared on TV shows such as ''[[Have I Got News For You]]''. He faced criticism about his brother but always remained loyal.

His son James married model [[Emma Noble]] on 29 May 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-203315/Ex-PM-Majors-son-quickie-divorce.html |title=Ex-PM Major's son in quickie divorce &amp;#124; Mail Online |work=Daily Mail |location=London |date=29 May 1999 |accessdate=13 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and their son Harrison (later diagnosed as [[Autism|autistic]]) was born the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/61547 |title=Express.co.uk – Home of the Daily and Sunday Express &amp;#124; Express Yourself :: Emma's Major rift |publisher=Dailyexpress.co.uk |date=15 September 2008 |accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was announced in April 2003 that the couple had separated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-175276/James-Emma-break-up.html |title=James and Emma break-up &amp;#124; Mail Online |work=Daily Mail |location=London |accessdate=13 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They divorced later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/2008/09/28/major-s-affair-with-his-son-s-blonde-teacher-93463-20757601/ |title=News – Uk &amp; World News – Major'S Affair With His Son'S Blonde Teacher |publisher=People.co.uk |date=28 September 2008 |accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Elizabeth married Luke Salter on 26 March 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/691356.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; John Major's daughter weds |publisher=BBC News  |date=26 March 2000 |accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; having been in a relationship since 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/348932.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; The miraculous Major-Balls |publisher=BBC News  |date=21 May 1999 |accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salter died on 22 November 2002 from cancer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2505099.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Major's son-in-law dies |publisher=BBC News  |date=22 November 2002 |accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; just months after qualifying as a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Diggines |first=Graham |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article140437.ece |title=Major girl's husband dies &amp;#124; The Sun &amp;#124;News |work=The Sun |date=23 November 2002 |accessdate=13 March 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Leslie Prescott, Baron Prescott&lt;!-- NOT Baron Prescott of Kingston-upon-Hull, see talk page for explanation of why--&gt;''' (born 31 May 1938) is a British politician who was [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1997 to 2007.  Born in [[Prestatyn]], Wales, he represented [[Kingston upon Hull East (UK Parliament constituency)|Hull East]] as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Member of Parliament from [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970]] to [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010]]. In the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1994|1994 leadership election]] he stood for both Leader and [[Deputy Leader of the British Labour Party|Deputy Leader of the Labour Party]], winning election to the latter office. He was appointed Deputy Prime Minister after Labour's victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 election]], with an expanded brief as [[Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions]].

A former ship's [[Steward's Assistant|steward]] and trade union activist, by the 1980s he was presented as the political link to the working class in a Labour Party increasingly led by modernising, middle-class professionals. In his youth, Prescott managed to overcome the handicap of failing his [[Eleven plus exam|11-plus]] entrance examination for [[grammar school]], going on to graduate from [[Ruskin College]] in Oxford. Prescott also developed a reputation as a key conciliator in the often tense relationship between [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]] and Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]].

On 27 June 2007 he resigned as Deputy Prime Minister, to coincide with Blair's resignation as Prime Minister. Following an election within the Labour Party, he was replaced as Deputy Leader by [[Harriet Harman]].  Prescott stepped down as an MP at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|May 2010 general election]]. On 8 July 2010 he entered the [[House of Lords]] as a [[life peer]] with the title &quot;Baron Prescott, of [[Kingston upon Hull]] in the County of [[East Yorkshire]]&quot;; he is now often referred to as '''Lord Prescott'''.

==Early life==
The son of John Herbert Prescott, a [[signalman (rail)|railway signalman]] and Labour councillor, and Phyllis, and grandson of a miner, Prescott was born in Prestatyn, [[Flintshire (historic)|Flintshire]] (now in Denbighshire), Wales, on 31 May 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sean O'Grady |date=19 May 2001 |title=John Prescott: A street-fighting man

I’m Welsh. It’s my place of birth, my country.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;IcWales&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=WalesOnline – News – Wales News – John Prescott learns of incest among his Welsh ancestors|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2009/11/30/john-prescott-learns-of-incest-among-his-welsh-ancestors-91466-25284089/|accessdate=2009-12-01|publisher=Media Wales Ltd|date=2009-11-30|work=WalesOnline website}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He left Wales in 1942 at the age of four and was brought up initially in [[Brinsworth]] in [[South Yorkshire]], England. He attended Brinsworth Primary School (known then as Brinsworth Manor School), where in 1949 he sat but failed the [[11-plus]] examination to attend [[Rotherham Grammar School]]. Shortly after, his family moved to [[Upton, Cheshire]] and he went to school in nearby [[Ellesmere Port]], where he attended Grange Secondary Modern School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/book_extracts/article3997506.ece|title=My love letter was sent back, spelling corrected|work = The Times |location=London|date=2008-05-25|accessdate=2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became a steward and waiter in the [[British Merchant Navy|Merchant Navy]], thus avoiding [[National Service]], working for [[Cunard Line|Cunard]], and was a popular left-wing union activist. Prescott's time in the [[Merchant Marine]] included a cruise from England to New Zealand in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/pip/0b1vp/ | title=Prescott at Your Service | publisher=BBC Radio 4 | accessdate=2007-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;prescott_eden&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6296053.stm|title=When Prescott served Eden|last=Grimley|first=Naomi |date=25 January 2007|work=BBC News|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the passengers was Sir [[Anthony Eden]], recuperating after his resignation over the [[Suez Crisis]]. Prescott reportedly described Eden as a &quot;real gentleman&quot;. Apart from serving Eden, who stayed in his cabin much of the time, Prescott also won several boxing contests, at which Eden presented the prizes.&lt;ref name=&quot;prescott_eden&quot;/&gt; He married Pauline &quot;Tilly&quot; Tilston at Upton Church in Chester on 11 November 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/pauline-prescott-wounded-party-476073.html | title=Pauline Prescott: Wounded party | work=The Independent | accessdate=2009-11-17 | location=London | first=Colin | last=Brown | date=29 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then went to the independent [[Ruskin College]] in [[Oxford]], which specialises in courses for union officials, where he gained a diploma in economics and politics in 1965. In 1968, he obtained a BSc in economics and [[economic history]] at the [[University of Hull]].

==Member of Parliament==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=February 2011}}
He returned to the [[National Union of Seamen]] as a full-time official before being elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] as Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Kingston upon Hull East (UK Parliament constituency)|Hull East]] in 1970, succeeding Commander [[Harry Pursey]], the retiring Labour MP. The defeated Conservative challenger was [[Norman Lamont (1942)|Norman Lamont]]. Previously, he had attempted to become MP for [[Southport (UK Parliament constituency)|Southport]] in 1966, but came in second place, approximately 9,500 votes behind the Conservative candidate. From July 1975 to 1979, he concurrently served as a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP) and Leader of the Labour Group, when its members were nominated by the national Parliaments.

Prescott held various posts in Labour's [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Shadow Cabinet]], but his career was secured by an impassioned closing speech in the debate at the [[Labour Party Conference]] in 1993 on the introduction of &quot;one member, one vote&quot; for the selection and reselection of Labour Parliamentary candidates that helped swing the vote in favour of this reform. In 1994 Prescott was a candidate in the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1994|party leadership election]] that followed the death of [[John Smith (UK politician)|John Smith]], standing for the positions of both [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|leader]] and [[Deputy Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|deputy leader]]. [[Tony Blair]] won the leadership contest, with Prescott being elected deputy leader.

==Deputy Prime Minister==
[[File:JPrescott.jpg|thumb|left|175px|John Prescott in May 2007]]
With the election of a Labour Government in [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]], Prescott was made [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] and given a very large [[portfolio (government)|portfolio]] as the head of the newly created [[Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions]].

In the United Kingdom, the title of Deputy Prime Minister is used only occasionally, and confers no constitutional powers (in which it is similar to the pre-20th century usage of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]). The Deputy Prime Minister stands in when the Prime Minister is unavailable, most visibly at [[Prime Minister's Questions]], and Prescott had attended various Heads of Government meetings on behalf of then Prime Minister Tony Blair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bilateral Meeting Of The Prime Minister Of The Republic Of Poland With The Deputy Prime Minister Of Great Britain | url = http://www.kprm.gov.pl/english/2130_7446.htm | publisher = The Chancellery of the Prime Minister (Poland) | accessdate = 2006-06-09}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the position of Deputy Prime Minister draws no salary, Prescott's remuneration was based on his position as [[Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions]] until [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001]]. This &quot;super department&quot; was then broken up, with the [[Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] and the [[Department for Transport]] established as separate entities. Prescott, still Deputy Prime Minister, was also given the largely honorific title of [[First Secretary of State]]. In July 2001 an Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) was created to administer the areas remaining under his responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The office of Deputy Prime Minister | url = http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-04023.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = House of Commons | accessdate = 2006-07-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060619223108/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-04023.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 19 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was originally part of the [[Cabinet Office]], but became a department in its own right in May 2002, when it absorbed some of the responsibilities of the former Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions. The ODPM had responsibility for local and regional government, housing, communities and the fire service.

===Environment===
The UK played a major role in the successful negotiations on the [[Kyoto Protocol]] on climate change and Prescott led the UK delegation at the discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2002/jun/01/greenpolitics.europeanunion | work= The Guardian | date = 1 June 2002 | title = Hopes for Kyoto rise after Japan and EU ratify treaty | author = Paul Brown | accessdate = 2008-10-01 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2006/jun/01/labour.uk1 | work = The Guardian | date = 1 June 2006 | title = Prescott's highs and lows | author = Stephen Habberley | accessdate = 2008-10-01 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, in recognition of his work in delivering the Kyoto Treaty, Tony Blair asked Prescott to work with the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and the [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Environment Secretary]] on developing the Government's post-Kyoto agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page1376.asp | publisher=10 Downing Street | accessdate= 2006-01-13 | title=John Leslie Prescott }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transport===
====Integrated transport policy====
On coming to office, Prescott pursued an integrated public transport policy. On 6 June 1997, he said: &quot;I will have failed if in five years time there are not...far fewer journeys by car. It's a tall order but I urge you to hold me to it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmhansrd/vo981020/debtext/81020-03.htm |title = ENVIRONMENT, TRANSPORT AND THE REGIONS, RELATING TO TRANSPORT The Secretary of State was asked |work=Hansard | date=1998-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, by June 2002, car traffic was up by 7%. This prompted [[Friends of the Earth]]’s Tony Bosworth to say &quot;By its own test, Government transport policy has failed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/press_releases/20020606000126.html |title=Friends of the Earth – Transport policy fails the Prescott test |publisher=Foe.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prescott had success in focusing attention on the role of car usage in the bigger environmental picture and the need for effective public transport alternatives if car volume is to be reduced. The subsequent debate on [[road pricing]] evolved from his policy. A contrast was highlighted between Prescott's transport brief and an incident, in 1999, when an official chauffeur-driven car was used to transport Prescott and his wife {{Convert|250|yd|m}} from their hotel to the venue of the Labour Party Conference, where Prescott gave a speech on how to encourage the use of public transport. Prescott explained, &quot;Because of the security reasons for one thing and second, my wife doesn't like to have her hair blown about. Have you got another silly question?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/461555.stm |title=UK Politics &amp;#124; Prescott walks it like he talks it |publisher=BBC News |date=1999-09-30 |accessdate=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott has been fined for speeding on 4 occasions.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;80mph Prescott fined&quot;, ''Sunday Times'', 5 January 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guy Patrick, &quot;Cops nick speeding Prescott&quot;, ''News of the World'', 5 January 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;9&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rail regulation====
Prescott had a stormy relationship with the privatisation of the railway industry. He had vigorously opposed the privatisation of the industry while the Labour Party was in opposition, and disliked the party's policy, established in 1996 just before the [[Initial public offering|flotation]] of [[Railtrack]] on the [[London Stock Exchange]], of committing to [[nationalisation|renationalise]] the industry only when resources allowed, which he saw as meaning that it would never be done.{{cn|date=January 2012}} Reluctantly, he supported the alternative policy, produced by then shadow transport secretary [[Clare Short]], that the industry should be subjected to closer regulation by the to-be-created [[Strategic Rail Authority]] (in the case of the passenger train operators) and the [[Rail Regulator]] (in the case of the monopoly and dominant elements in the industry, principally Railtrack). The policy was spelled out in some detail in the Labour Party's statement in the June 1996 prospectus for the sale of Railtrack shares, and was widely regarded as having depressed the price of the shares.{{cn|date=January 2012}}

In 1998, Prescott was criticised by investors in the railway for his statement – at the Labour Party conference that year – that the privatised railway was a &quot;national disgrace&quot;. The companies felt that they had had some considerable successes in cutting costs and generating new revenues in the short time since their transfer to private sector hands, and that the criticisms were premature and unfair.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

In that speech, Prescott also announced that he would be taking a far tougher line with the companies, and to that end he would be having a &quot;spring clean of the regulators&quot;.{{Cite quote|date=April 2009}} This meant that the incumbent [[Director of Passenger Rail Franchising]] – John O'Brien – and the Rail Regulator [[John Swift QC]] – both appointed by the previous [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government, would have to make way for new Labour appointees. In February 1999, the regulation of the passenger rail operators fell to Sir [[Alastair Morton]],&lt;ref name=regulators&gt;Sir Alastair Morton left office, early, in October 2001. Tom Winsor continued until the end of his five-year term in July 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; who Prescott announced would be appointed as chairman of the [[Strategic Rail Authority]], which would take over from the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising whose office would be wound up. In July 1999, the new Rail Regulator appointed by Prescott was [[Tom Winsor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;regulators&quot;/&gt; They shared Prescott's view that the railway industry needed a considerable shake-up in its institutional, operational, engineering and economic matrix to attract and retain private investment and enable the companies within it to become strong, competent and successful.{{cn|date=January 2012}}

===Local and regional government===
Responsible for local government, Prescott introduced a new system guiding members' conduct after 2001. The new system included a nationally agreed Code of Conduct laid down by [[Statutory Instrument]] which all local authorities were required to adopt; the Code of Conduct gives guidance on when councillors have an interest in a matter under discussion and when that interest is prejudicial so that the councillor may not speak or vote on the matter. Although on many areas councillors had previously been expected to withdraw where they had declared an interest, the new system made the system more formal and introduced specific sanctions for breaches; it was criticised for preventing councillors from representing the views of their local communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1511467/Christopher-Booker%27s-notebook.html | title = Christopher Booker's notebook | author = Christopher Booker | work = Daily Telegraph | date = 26 February 2006 | accessdate = 2008-10-01 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prescott supported regional government in England. Early in his term, he introduced [[Regional Assemblies in England|regional assemblies]] (consisting of delegates from local authorities and other regional stakeholders) to oversee the work of new Regional Development Agencies in the regions of England. Following Labour's second election victory, he pressed for the introduction of elected regional assemblies, which would have seen about 25 to 35 members elected under a similar electoral system to that used for the [[London Assembly]]. However, because of opposition, the government was forced to hold regional referendums on the change. The first three were intended to be in the North-East, North-West and Yorkshire and Humberside. The [[Northern England devolution referendums, 2004|North-East referendum]] in November 2004 was first (where support was felt to be strongest) but resulted in an overwhelming vote of 78% against. As a consequence, the plan for elected regional assemblies was shelved.

===Housing===
A rising number of households (especially in the south-east) was putting added pressure on housing during Prescott's tenure as the minister responsible. An increase in the housebuilding was proposed, primarily on ''[[brownfield land|brownfield]]'' sites, but also on some undeveloped ''[[greenfield land|greenfield]]'' areas and as a result he was accused of undermining the [[green belt (UK)|Green Belt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/politics/50935.stm |title=Politics &amp;#124; Labour homes policy comes under fire |publisher=BBC News |date=1998-01-27 |accessdate=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/142260.stm |title=UK Politics &amp;#124; MPs criticise Prescott's 'vague' building policy |publisher=BBC News |date=1998-07-30 |accessdate=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/473394.stm |title=UK Politics &amp;#124; Prescott under pressure over housing |publisher=BBC News |date=1999-10-13 |accessdate=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1305209.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; UK Politics &amp;#124; Tories pledge to protect greenbelt |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-04-30 |accessdate=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quote &quot;The green belt is a Labour achievement; and we intend to build upon it&quot; is attributed to Prescott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmhansrd/vo990203/debtext/90203-40.htm | title=Planning | work=Hansard | date=3 February 1999 : Column 996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the north of England, Prescott approved the demolition of some 200,000 homes that were judged to be in &quot;failing areas&quot; as part of his ''[[Neighbourhood Management Pathfinder Programme|Pathfinder]]'' regeneration scheme. It has been argued that renovating properties, rather than demolishing them, would have made better financial and community sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1490090/Has-John-Prescott-got-his-sums-right.html | title=Has John Prescott got his sums right? | work=Daily Telegraph  |location=London| author=Charles Clover | date=16 May 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to education reforms===
On 17 December 2005, Prescott made public his disapproval of Tony Blair's plans to give [[state schools]] the right to govern their finances and admission policies and to increase the number of [[Academy (English school)|city academies]]. It was the first policy stance that Prescott had made against Blair since his election as leader in 1994. Prescott said that the move would create a two-tier educational system that would discriminate against the working class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/prescott-hits-out-over-great-danger-from-blairs-school-reforms-519970.html | work = The Independent |location=London| date = 17 December 2005 | title = Prescott hits out over 'great danger' from Blair's school reforms | author = Francis Elliot |accessdate = 2008-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that Labour were &quot;always better fighting class&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1505758/Class-war-Prescott-attacks-Blair%27s-education-reforms-and-Cameron%27s-%27Eton-Mafia%27.html | title = Class war: Prescott attacks Blair's education reforms and Cameron's 'Eton Mafia' | author = Patrick Hennessy and Melissa Kite | work= Daily Telegraph |location=London | date = 19 December 2005 | accessdate = 2008-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Links with the grass roots===
Prescott, sometimes described as &quot;an old-school unionist&quot;, kept in touch with the views of the traditional Labour voters throughout his career. He became an important figure in Tony Blair's &quot;[[New Labour]]&quot; movement, as the representative of 'old Labour' interests in the [[Shadow Cabinet]] and subsequently around the Cabinet table as [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]].

However, now a member of the establishment, relationships with the [[Grassroots|grass roots]] were not always smooth. Whilst attending the [[BRIT Awards]] in 1998, [[Chumbawamba]] vocalist [[Danbert Nobacon]] poured a jug of iced water over Prescott, saying, &quot;This is for the [[Liverpool Dockers]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.spunk.org/library/music/chumba/sp001737/ | title=Soaked Prescott Rages At Pop Band | work=Evening Standard | date=10 February 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,4-2006150548,00.html | title=Brits to go live again | work=The Sun | location=London | date=17 May 2007}} {{Dead link|date=September 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Dock workers in [[Liverpool]] had been involved in a two-year industrial dispute: a strike that had turned into a [[lockout (industry)|lockout]], until a few weeks earlier.) A reporter from the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' threw water over Nobacon the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://archive.boltoneveningnews.co.uk/1998/6/3/799945.html | title=Four claret gold!

===Abolition of department===
In a [[2006 United Kingdom Cabinet reshuffle|Cabinet reshuffle]] on 5 May 2006, Prescott's departmental responsibilities were transferred to [[Ruth Kelly]], as [[Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government]], following revelations about his private life and a poor performance by Labour in that year's local elections. He remained as Deputy Prime Minister, with a seat in the Cabinet, and was given a role as a special envoy to the Far East as well as additional responsibilities chairing cabinet committees.&lt;ref name=&quot;keepspoils&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2168926.html | title=Prescott the predator keeps his spoils | work=Sunday Times | date=7 May 2006 | author=Isabel Oakeshott | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4989578.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; UK Politics &amp;#124; Blair outlines new Prescott role |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-05-17 |accessdate=2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having lost almost all his policy responsibilities it was announced that he would retain his full salary (£134,000pa) and pension entitlements, along with both his grace-and-favour homes, an announcement which received considerable criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Antony Barnett |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2006/may/07/uk.labour |title=Prescott pension pot to be £1.5m &amp;#124; Politics &amp;#124; The Observer |publisher=Guardian |date= 6 May 2006|accessdate=2010-06-07 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The press speculated in July 2006 that, as a consequence of the continuing problems centred on Prescott, Blair was preparing to [[Labour Party (UK) deputy leadership election, 2007|replace him]] as Deputy Prime Minister with [[David Miliband]], whilst possibly retaining Prescott as [[Deputy Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Deputy Leader of the Labour Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2261991,00.html| title=No. 10 lines up Miliband for Prescott job | work=Sunday Times | date=9 July 2006 | location=London | first1=David | last1=Cracknell | first2=Jon | last2=UngoedThomas | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but nothing came of this.

===Announcement of retirement===
On 28 September, at the 2006 [[Labour Party (UK) Conference|Labour Party Conference]] in Manchester, John Prescott apologised in his speech for the bad press he had caused for the party during the previous year. He said: &quot;I know in the last year I let myself down, I let you down. So Conference, I just want to say sorry.&quot; He confirmed that he would stand down as Deputy Leader when Tony Blair left Downing Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5386428.stm| title=Prescott tells Labour: I'm sorry | publisher=BBC News | date=28 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 January 2007, he announced in the House of Commons that &quot;I'm in a rather happy [[demob]] stage&quot;, in a combative performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6317459.stm| title=I'm 'demob happy', says Prescott| publisher=BBC News | date=31 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within 30 minutes of Tony Blair announcing the date of his resignation on 10 May 2007, Prescott announced his resignation as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party. During the subsequent special Labour Party Conference, at which [[Gordon Brown]] was elected Leader and [[Harriet Harman]] succeeded Prescott as Deputy Leader, Prescott received a prolonged [[standing ovation]] from the members present, in recognition of his many years of service to the party.

==Life after government==
Following his resignation, it was announced that he would take over from [[Tony Lloyd]] as the lead UK Representative in the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]]. The post is unpaid, but has an expenses allowance and allows him to sit on the [[Assembly of WEU|Assembly of Western European Union]]. In a jocular response to the appointment, Shadow Europe Minister [[Mark Francois]] wished the translators good luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6271112.stm| title=Prescott in Council of Europe job | publisher=BBC News | date=4 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 August 2007, Prescott stated that he would stand down as an MP at [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|the next general election]], after which he was offered a [[Peerage]]. He has also engaged in the campaign against slave labour, which he intends to make a key issue in his work at the Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/prescott-to-stand-down-at-election-and-focus-on-council-of-europe-role-462652.html | title = Prescott to stand down at election and focus on Council of Europe role | work= The Independent | date = 23 August 2007 | accessdate = 2008-10-01 | location=London | first1=Colin | last1=Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6965184.stm|title=John Prescott to stand down as MP|publisher=BBC|date=2007-08-27|accessdate=2007-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Prescott is a director of [[Super League]] rugby league club [[Hull Kingston Rovers]], who are based in his former constituency of Hull East.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prescott handed role at Hull KR&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/super_league/hull_kr/7049899.stm|title=Prescott handed role at Hull KR|publisher=BBC|date=2007-10-18|accessdate=2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His autobiography, ''Prezza, My Story: Pulling no Punches''&lt;ref&gt;Headline: ISBN 9780755317752.&lt;/ref&gt; ghostwritten by [[Hunter Davies]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebookseller.com/in-depth/feature/47944-have-they-got-books-for-you.html The Bookseller: &quot;Have they got books for you&quot;]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was published on 29 May 2008.

In June 2008, he made a cameo appearance, playing a policeman, in the [[BBC Radio 4]] adaptation of [[Robert Tressell]]'s ''[[The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists]]''. In 2009, he made a brief cameo appearance as himself in the final episode of the [[BBC Three]] comedy series [[Gavin and Stacey]] (this referred to a running joke in the show regarding a relationship the character Nessa had years ago with Prescott.)

In October and November 2008 he was the subject of a two-part documentary, ''&quot;Prescott: the Class System and Me&quot;'', on BBC Two, looking at the class system in Britain, and asking whether it still exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | word = [[The Independent]] | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/last-nights-television--prescott-the-class-system-and-me-bbc2-spooks-bbc1-975284.html | title = Last Night's Television – Prescott: The Class System and Me, BBC2 | date = 28 October 2008 | accessdate = 2008-11-01 | location=London | first=Robert | last=Hanks}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009, he was featured in another BBC Two documentary, ''Prescott: The North/South Divide'', where Prescott and his wife Pauline explored the current state of the [[North-South divide (England)|North-South Divide]] from their perspective as Northern Englanders long used to living in the south of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2009/oct/15/prescott-the-north-south-divide |title=Prescott: The North/South Divide |publisher=The Guardian |date=15 October 2009 |last=Wollaston |first=Sam |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2010 election campaign, Prescott toured the UK in a customised white transit van dubbed his &quot;Battlebus&quot; canvassing support for the Labour Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/the_daily_politics/8607402.stm |title=John Prescott launches his Election Battlebus |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-04-07 |accessdate=2012-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott was publicly very supportive of [[Gordon Brown]], and has called him a &quot;global giant&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8267420.stm | work=BBC News | title=Prescott: Brown is 'global giant' | date=21 September 2009 | accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prescott has stated in interviews that he is not religious.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pinknews.co.uk&quot;/&gt; He chose to make a non-religious [[Affirmation in law|solemn affirmation]] rather than swearing an oath during his introduction in the House of Lords.

Beginning on 7 January 2011, John Prescott appeared in a TV advert for insurance company [[moneysupermarket.com]], along with comedian [[Omid Djalili]], which gently mocks events in his political career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=John Prescott 'paid five figures' for boxing advert|author=|first=Andy|last=Bloxham|authorlink=|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8245333/John-Prescott-paid-five-figures-for-boxing-advert.html|agency=|newspaper=The Telegraph|publisher=|location=London|date=7 January 2011|accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{irrel|date=September 2011}}

On 27 February 2011, Prescott appeared on the [[BBC|BBC's]] [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]] as the &quot;Star in the Reasonably Priced Car&quot;, where he set a lap time of 1.56.7. It is the slowest time in the new car. He also engaged in spirited discussion with host [[Jeremy Clarkson]] regarding his time in Government.

To raise awareness of [[Red Nose Day 2011]], a charity event organised by [[Comic Relief]], Prescott delivered the area forecasts of the 0048 [[Shipping Forecast]] on Saturday 19 March 2011.  The format then reverted to the BBC continuity announcer [[Alice Arnold]] for the reports on coastal areas.  On delivering the area forecast for Humber, Prescott (who had represented the parliamentary constituency of [[Hull East]] for almost 40 years before retiring) slipped deliberately into his distinctive Humberside accent, saying “'Umber, without the 'H', as we say it up there”.

==Life peerage==
It was announced on 28 May 2010 that Prescott was to be awarded a [[life peerage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8711821.stm | work=BBC News | title = Dissolution honours: John Prescott made a peer | date=28 May 2010 | accessdate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peerage was [[London Gazette|gazetted]] on 15 June in the [[2010 Dissolution Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=59459|supp=yes|startpage=11151|date=15 June 2010|accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was introduced in the House of Lords on 8 July as '''Baron Prescott''', of Kingston upon Hull in the County of [[East Yorkshire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/politics/10550850.stm | work=BBC News | title = Lord Prescott takes his place in the House of Lords | date=2010-07-08 | accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Letters Patent]] were gazetted on 12 July, dated 7 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=59485|startpage=13181|date=12 July 2010|accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iraq War inquiry==
On 30 July 2010, Lord Prescott appeared before the panel at the [[Chilcot Inquiry]] concerning the [[Iraq War]]. Prescott stated that he was doubtful about the legality, intelligence and information about Iraq's [[Weapons of Mass Destruction]]. The Inquiry was launched by [[Gordon Brown]] in the summer of 2009 shortly after operations the war ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/jul/30/lord-prescott-chilcot-inquiry | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Lord Prescott admits intelligence doubts prior to Iraq war | first=Helene | last=Mulholland | date=30 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, Prescott announced he has the eating disorder [[bulimia nervosa]], which he believed was brought on by stress since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Prescott tells of bulimia battle | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7357008.stm | work=BBC News | date=20 April 2008 | accessdate=2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversies==
Prescott has been involved in a number of controversies and incidents that have caused public concern and widespread media interest. During the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 election campaign]], Prescott was campaigning in [[Rhyl]] when farmer Craig Evans threw an egg at him, which struck him in the neck. Prescott, a former amateur boxer, responded immediately with a straight left to the jaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bofunk.com/video/648/egg_head.html | title=Egg Head | publisher=bofunk.com | accessdate=2006-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1335000/1335033.stm | title=Prescott sees red | publisher=BBC News | date=17 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1335000/1335107.stm | title=Prescott 'regrets' blow | publisher=BBC News | date=17 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident, overshadowing the launch of the Labour Party manifesto on that day, was captured by numerous television crews. Tony Blair responded succinctly, stating, &quot;John is John&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/6634855.stm |title=In Pictures: John Prescott |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-05-10 |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a [[National Opinion Polls]] (NOP) survey found that the incident appeared to do no public harm to Prescott, and may even have benefited his standing amongst male voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ukpol.co.uk/messages/messages/6/1388.html?1123516499 | title=NOP poll and Sunday Times analysis | publisher=UKPOL | accessdate=2006-04-30}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Prescott gave up a [[grace and favour]] home that he had rented from the [[National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers|RMT Union]] in [[Clapham]], despite leaving the union in June 2002. Prescott paid £220 a month for the property — a fifth of its market value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article999709.ece | title=Heroes of the Empire fight to stay rent-free | date=21 January 2004 | work=The Times| accessdate= 28 November 2008 | location=London | first=Jack | last=Malvern}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he had not declared the flat in the register of members' interests, he was subsequently exonerated by MPs who overruled [[Elizabeth Filkin]], the [[Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2000/may/18/uk.parliament1 | title=Watchdog overruled.

He repaid the amount, which came to £3,830.52 over nearly nine years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4607110.stm | title=Prescott apologises over tax bill | date=12 January 2006 | publisher=BBC News| accessdate= 28 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been additional controversies over sexual infidelities and harassment allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml;jsessionid=5MIWK2BD1FOB5QFIQMGCFFWAVCBQUIV0?xml=/opinion/2006/05/02/do0202.xml&amp;sSheet=/opinion/2006/05/02/ixopinion.html | title=Prescott, a bully from a more brutal age | work=Daily Telegraph | author=Ben Fenton | date=2 May 2006 | location=London}}{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 April 2006, Prescott admitted to having had an affair with his diary secretary, Tracey Temple, between 2002 and 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;admit&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4945170.stm | title=Prescott admits affair with aide | date=28 April 2006 | publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily Mail|Mail on Sunday]]'' broke the news with extracts from Temple's memoirs.

Conservative MP [[Andrew Robathan]] tabled questions in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] over John Prescott's reported entertainment of Ms Temple at [[Dorneywood]], his official residence, which raised questions over the possible misuse of public finances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4950238.stm | title=Standards question over Prescott | publisher=BBC | date=27 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trevor Kavanagh]], former political editor of ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'', told [[BBC Radio 5 Live]]: &quot;Learning that John Prescott's had an affair is a bit like learning that [[Simon Hughes]] is gay.

On 30 July 2006, it was revealed that Tricia McDaid had filed suit for sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sundaylife.co.uk/news/story.jsp?story=700455 | title=Ulster journo sues Prescott for sexual harassment | work=Belfast Telegraph | date=30 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was criticised for maintaining the benefits of Deputy Prime Minister despite losing his department in 2006. He was also attacked for visiting the American billionaire [[Phil Anschutz]], who was bidding for the government licence to build a [[super casino]] in the UK, and questioned over his involvement in the business of his son Johnathan Prescott.

He gained a reputation in the British press for confused speech, mangled syntax and poor grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/politics/domestic_politics/factcheck+prezza+pulls+his+punches/2265407 | title=FactCheck: Prezza pulls his punches? | date=30 May 2008 | publisher=[[Channel 4 News]]| accessdate= 28 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' columnist [[Simon Hoggart]] once commented:
&quot;Every time Prescott opens his mouth, it's like someone has flipped open his head and stuck in an egg whisk.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thefridayproject.co.uk/hi/tft/politics/002023.php| title= John Prescott: An Upstanding Member of UK PLC | date= 28 April 2006 | publisher= The Friday Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; An oft-quoted but unverified story in [[Jeremy Paxman]]'s ''The Political Animal'' is that, before being accepted as transcribers to the Parliamentary record the ''[[Hansard]]'', applicants must listen to one of Prescott's speeches and write down what they think he was trying to say.

The media have attached various [[sobriquet]]s to John Prescott during his political career. Originally, Prescott's nickname was simply &quot;Prezza&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2261946,00.html| title= Prezza's big gamble on Dome billionaire | date= 9 July 2006 | work= The Times | location=London}} {{Dead link|date=September 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as various misfortunes befell Prescott the sobriquets became more colourful, leading to &quot;Two Jags&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1459928.stm| title= 'Two Jags' Prescott in parking row | date= 27 July 2001 | publisher= The BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Prescott owns one [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]], and had the use of another as his official ministerial car).

''The Independent'' later referred to Prescott as &quot;No Jobs&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/columnists/pandora/another-sacked-minister-holds-on-to-his-residence-479446.html | title = Another sacked minister holds on to his residence | date = 24 May 2006 | work= The Independent | accessdate = 2008-10-01 | location=London | first=Guy | last=Adams}}{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he lost his department in a cabinet reshuffle following exposure of his affair, despite keeping the benefits and residences associated with his title, which became a [[sinecure]].

On 8 May 2009, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' began publishing [[MPs' expenses row|leaked details of MPs' expenses]]. ''The Telegraph'' reported that Prescott have claimed £312 for fitting mock Tudor beams to his constituency home, and for two new toilet seats in as many years. Prescott responded by saying, &quot;Every expense was within the rules of the House of Commons on claiming expenses at the time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8039273.stm#prescott_john | work=BBC News | title=Key details: MP expenses claims | date=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
Prescott and Pauline Tilston married in 1961. They have two sons. Their younger son, David Prescott, is active in Labour party politics and sought, but failed, to be selected for his father's parliamentary seat in Hull.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7299977.stm|title=Son loses bid for Prescott's seat|work=BBC News|date=17 March 2008|accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their older son, Johnathan Prescott, is a businessman. Pauline had a son by an American airman in the 1950s, whom she gave up for adoption.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pauline&quot;/&gt;

'''John Smith''' (13 September 1938 - 12 May 1994) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[politician]] who served as [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] from July 1992 until his sudden death from a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in May 1994. He first entered parliament in 1970 and was the [[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills|Secretary of State for Trade]] from 1978–1979 and then the [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]] under [[Neil Kinnock]] from 1987-1992.

== Early life ==
{{unsourced section|date=December 2011}}
Smith was born in [[Dalmally]], the son of a [[Headmaster]], and grew up in [[Ardrishaig]] in [[Argyll and Bute]].  He attended [[Dunoon Grammar School]] ([[Dunoon]], [[Cowal]]), lodging in the town with a landlady and going home only during the holidays, before enrolling at the [[University of Glasgow]], where he studied [[History]] from the Autumn of 1956 to 1959, and then [[University of Glasgow School of Law|Law]], from 1959 to 1962.  He joined the Labour Party in 1956.

He became involved in [[debate|debating]] with the [[Glasgow University Dialectic Society]] and the [[Glasgow University Union]]. In 1962, he won ''[[The Observer]]'' Mace debating competition, speaking with Gordon Hunter. In 1995, after his death, the competition was renamed the [[John Smith Memorial Mace]] in his honour.

After graduating, Smith practised as a [[solicitor]] for a year.  He was then elected to the [[Faculty of Advocates]], and later to the [[British Parliament]] as an MP. He took silk, becoming a Queens Counsel in 1983.

== Member of Parliament ==
Smith first stood as a Labour parliamentary candidate at a [[East Fife by-election, 1961|by-election in 1961]] in the [[East Fife (UK Parliament constituency)|East Fife constituency]], and contested that seat again in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 general election]]. At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970 general election]] he was elected as [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[North Lanarkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North Lanarkshire]] succeeding Peggy Herbison. Smith defied the Labour whips in 1971, joining the Labour MPs who, led by Roy Jenkins, voted in favour of entry to the [[European Economic Community]]. These included [[Roy Hattersley]], [[Shirley Williams]], [[Bill Rodgers]] and [[David Owen]] all of whom he was later to sit with in the Callaghan cabinet.

=== In Government ===
In October 1974, Harold Wilson offered Smith the post of [[Solicitor General for Scotland]]. Smith turned it down, not wishing his political career to become sidelined as a law officer.  He was instead made an [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State|Under-Secretary]] of State at the [[United Kingdom Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]. In December 1975 he was made a [[Minister of State]]. When [[James Callaghan]] became Prime Minister, Smith became a Minister of State at the [[Privy Council Office (United Kingdom)|Privy Council Office]], serving with Labour's Deputy leader, Michael Foot, the [[Lord President of the Council]] and [[Leader of the House of Commons]].  In this position Smith piloted the highly controversial [[devolution]] proposals for Scotland and Wales through the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Smith's adroit handling of these proposals impressed Callaghan, and in November 1978, when [[Edmund Dell]] retired, Callaghan appointed Smith [[Secretary of State for Trade]]. In this post, Smith was the youngest member of the cabinet, and served there until the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]].

=== Shadow Cabinet ===
In the early 1980s Smith was [[Secretary of State for Energy|Shadow Energy Secretary]]. He became a [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] in 1983, the same year that the constituency became [[Monklands East (UK Parliament constituency)|Monklands East]]. Smith acted as [[Roy Hattersley]]'s campaign manager for the party leadership election in [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1983|October 1983]] and after serving a year as [[Secretary of State for Employment|Shadow Employment Secretary]], was [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry|Shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]] between late 1984 and 1987.

=== Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer ===
Smith was appointed Shadow Chancellor by Neil Kinnock in July 1987 after Party's general election defeat. However, he suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] whilst [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]] on 9 October 1988 and was forced to spend three months away from [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] to recover. On that occasion, he had complained of chest pains the night before, and had to be persuaded to cancel a flight to London so he could go to hospital for a check up. He was examined at the [[Edinburgh Royal Infirmary]] by an [[Electrocardiogram|ECG]]. The doctor who examined him said &quot;Whatever it is, we don't think it is your heart&quot;. Then Smith suddenly collapsed and was briefly unconscious before coming around. He spent three days in intensive care before leaving hospital on 20 October 1988, to make a full recovery.

Smith made modifications to his lifestyle by going on a 1,000 calorie diet, cutting down on rich foods and fine wines, giving up smoking and taking up ''[[Munro#Climbing_the_Munros|Munro bagging]]'' and by the time of his death he had succeeded in climbing 108 of the 277 Scottish Munros (mountains over 3,000 feet above sea level at the summit). His weight dropped from 15 [[Stone (weight)|stone]] 5 pounds (98&amp;nbsp;kg) at the time of the first heart attack, to 12 stone 10 pounds (81&amp;nbsp;kg) when he returned to Parliament on 23 January 1989.

Despite a quiet, modest manner, and his politically moderate stance, he was a witty, often scathing speaker. Smith was named as Parliamentarian of the year twice; the first time in November 1986 for his performances during the [[Westland affair|Westland controversy]], during which [[Leon Brittan, Baron Brittan of Spennithorne|Leon Brittan]] resigned and the second was in November 1989 for taking [[Nigel Lawson]] to task over the state of the economy and over his difficult relationship with Sir Alan Walters, the Prime Minister's Economic Adviser. Smith made two notably witty attacks on Lawson that year. On 7 June 1989 he sang the theme tune for the soap ''[[Neighbours]]'' at the dispatch box, lampooning the differences between Lawson and Sir [[Alan Walters]], who was critical of Lawson's policies (Thatcher still refused to sack him). Then on 24 October he made another scathing attack on the differences. Two days later, Lawson resigned, followed shortly afterwards by Sir Alan.

=== Leader of the Opposition ===

Following Labour's fourth successive defeat at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|general election of April 1992]], Neil Kinnock resigned as leader and Smith [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1992|was elected]] Labour leader.

Although Labour had now been out of power for 13 years, their performance at that general election had been much better than their performance at the previous three. They had cut the Tory majority from 144 seats to a mere 21, and for most of the three years leading up to the election opinion polls had indicated that Labour were more likely to win the election than the Tories were. However, the resignation of long-serving but at that point hugely unpopular Tory prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] and the well-received election of [[John Major]] as her successor had seen the comfortable Labour lead in the opinion polls wiped out and in the 17 months leading up to the election its outcome had become much less predictable. Much of the blame had been placed on Labour's &quot;shadow budget&quot; drawn up by Smith, which included raising the top rate of income tax from 40p in the pound to 50p, and the Tory election campaign was centred on warning voters that they would face higher taxes under a Labour government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-10518842 | work=BBC News | title=The rise and fall of New Labour | date=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1992, he made his maiden speech as party leader, about the Government's [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism|ERM]] debacle eight days earlier, saying that John Major was &quot;The devalued Prime Minister of a devalued Government&quot;. At the party conference he referred to Major and [[Norman Lamont (1942)|Norman Lamont]] as being the [[Laurel and Hardy]] of British politics. This echoed his attacks on Major's government which he had made before the 1992 election while still shadow chancellor, most memorably when he attacked Tory plans for cutting income tax to 20% as &quot;irresponsible&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8149630.stm|title=Election countdown - 1990s style|first=Brian|last=Wheeler|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=21 July 2009|accessdate=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and joked at a Labour Party rally in [[Sheffield]] that the Tories would have a box office disaster with &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Economy&quot; - in reference to the recent [[Disney]] motion picture ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]'' - mocking the [[Early 1990s recession|recession]] which was plaguing the British economy at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/sheffield/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8170000/8170344.stm|title=Kinnock came and didn't conquer|publisher=[[BBC News]]|first=Stephanie|last=Barnard|date=27 July 2009|accessdate=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a June 1993 debate, Smith again savaged the Conservative Government, saying that under [[John Major|John Major's]] premiership, &quot;The man with the non-[[midas]] touch is in charge. It is no wonder that we live in a country where the [[Grand National]] does not start and [[Holbeck Hall Hotel|hotels fall into the sea]]&quot;. During the same debate, Smith referred to a recent Government defeat in the [[Newbury by-election, 1993|Newbury by-election]], a poor showing in the local elections, and a subsequent Cabinet reshuffle by saying that, &quot;If we were to offer that tale of events to the BBC Light Entertainment Department as a script for a programme, I think that the producers of ''[[Yes Minister]]'' would have turned it down as hopelessly over the top. It might have even been too much for ''[[Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em]]''&quot;. He also performed very well in the [[1993 vote of confidence in the government of John Major|motion of confidence debate]] in the Conservative government in July 1993.

Despite his dispatch box successes (Smith was always more effective in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] than on platforms or at [[Prime Minister's Questions]], though he began to improve at the latter during the final months of his life), [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]] were, under Smith's leadership, restless and anxious in private that the party had adopted a &quot;one more heave&quot; approach and had become overly cautious in tackling the legacy of &quot;[[tax and spend]]&quot;. 

Despite this, during his time as leader of the Labour Party Smith abolished the [[trade union]] [[Voting block|block vote]] at [[Labour Party (UK) Conference|Labour party conferences]], and replaced it with &quot;[[one member one vote]]&quot; at the 1993 party conference and committed a future Labour government to establishing a [[Scottish Parliament]], a policy which was followed through by his successors (most notably his close friend [[Donald Dewar]]) after his death. Also, during his time as leader, the Labour party gained a significant lead in the polls over the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and on 5 May 1994 the Conservatives received a severe defeat in the council elections in Britain, their worst for over 30 years, despite the strong economic recovery and fall in unemployment that had followed the declaration of the recession's end in April 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503271.stm | work=BBC News | title=1993: Recession over - it's official | date=26 April 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;Labour's opinion poll lead was shown to be as high as 23% in early May 1994.

=== Death ===
On the evening of 11 May 1994, Smith made a speech at a fundraising dinner at [[Park Lane Hotel]], London with around 500 people present, saying famously &quot;The opportunity to serve our country - that is all we ask&quot;. The following morning, at 8:05am, whilst in his [[Barbican Estate|Barbican]] flat, Smith suffered a massive heart attack. His wife phoned an ambulance and he was rushed to [[St Bartholomew's Hospital|Saint Bartholomew's Hospital]] where he died at 9:15am on 12 May 1994 having never regained consciousness. Only two weeks before his death, on 28 April, Smith had visited the same accident and emergency department to campaign against its proposed closure. The very doctor who served as his tour guide, Professor Mike Besser, two weeks later tried unsuccessfully to save Smith's life. 

In response to his death, John Major paid tribute in the House of Commons to Smith, culminating in the now well-known line, that Smith &quot;would share a drink: sometimes tea, sometimes not tea&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jz8_zU-gviU YouTube - Labour leader John Smith Dies, May 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199394/cmhansrd/1994-05-12/Debate-1.html House of Commons, Thursday 12 May 1994]&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that there was weeping in the chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/graduate_management/article1347006.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=How do I become a stenographer | first=Sarah | last=Campbell | date=8 February 2007 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day of his death, the BBC 9 O'Clock News was extended to an hour as opposed to the usual half hour. This replaced the medical drama which was due to follow at 9:30, coincidentally entitled ''[[Cardiac Arrest (TV series)|Cardiac Arrest]]''. That evening ''Question Time'' was held, and the panellists paid tribute to Smith, instead of debating. They included [[George Robertson, Baron Robertson of Port Ellen|George Robertson]] and [[Menzies Campbell]]. 

On 20 May 1994, after a funeral in Cluny Parish Church, [[Edinburgh]] attended by 900 people and after which 3,000 people lined the streets, Smith was buried in a private family funeral on the island of [[Iona]], at the sacred burial ground of Reilig Odhráin, which contains the graves of several Scottish kings as well as monarchs of Ireland, Norway and France.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scotland.org.uk/guide/Isle_of_Iona&lt;/ref&gt; His grave is marked with an epitaph quoting [[Alexander Pope]]: &quot;An honest man's the noblest work of God&quot;.&lt;ref name=rowe&gt;[http://travel.independent.co.uk/uk/article625010.ece ''Walk Of The Month: The island of Iona''] ''[[The Independent]]'' 4 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 July 1994, his memorial service was attended in [[Westminster Abbey]] by over 2,000 people. The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] gave an address.

Following Smith's death, the Labour Party renamed its party headquarters in [[Walworth Road]] ''[[John Smith House (Southwark)|John Smith House]]'' in his memory.

=== Aftermath ===
Smith's biographer, Mark Stuart, claimed that Smith could have won Labour a Parliamentary victory in 1997 on a similar scale to that achieved by Tony Blair because of the combination of the [[Black Wednesday]] debacle and ongoing Conservative divisions over Europe between 1992 and 1997; however, Stuart argues that the lack of a ''Blair effect'' would have meant that the Conservative Party would have held slightly over 200 seats in the House of Commons, leaving the Conservatives in a position similar to that of Labour in 1983 than to the actual Conservative result in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, M. in Brack, D. and I. Dale (editors) (2003)''Prime Minister Portillo and other things that never happened'', Politico's Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; The sense that Smith's untimely death cheated him of the premiership may well have contributed to the nostalgia for his leadership by the Labour left, although Smith was always on the [[Gaitskellite]] wing of the party. This is borne out by the warm tributes paid to him after his death by figures on the left of the party such as [[Tony Benn]], [[Dennis Skinner]] and [[Ken Livingstone]].

== Personal life ==
{{Unsourced section|date=January 2011}}
Smith was married to Elizabeth Bennett from 5 July 1967 until his death. Elizabeth Smith was created [[Elizabeth Smith, Baroness Smith of Gilmorehill|Baroness Smith of Gilmorehill]] in 1995. They had three daughters, one of whom, [[Sarah Smith (news reporter)|Sarah Smith]], used to be Washington correspondent for [[Channel 4]] news.

The '''Labour Party''' is a [[centre-left]], [[social democratic]] and [[democratic socialist]] political party in the [[United Kingdom]]. It overtook the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in general elections during the early 1920s, forming minority governments under [[Ramsay MacDonald]] in [[Labour Government 1924|1924]] and [[Labour Government 1929–1931|1929-1931]]. The party was in a [[Churchill War Ministry|wartime coalition]] from 1940 to 1945, after which it formed a [[1945 Labour Government|majority government]] under [[Clement Attlee]]. Labour was also in government from [[Labour Government 1964–1970|1964 to 1970]] under [[Harold Wilson]] and from [[Labour Government 1974–1979|1974 to 1979]], first under Wilson and then [[James Callaghan]]. 

The Labour Party was last in national government between [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010]] under [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]], beginning with a majority of 179, reduced to 167 in [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001]] and 66 in [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005]]. Having won 258 seats in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], Labour is the [[Official Opposition (United Kingdom)|Official Opposition]]. Labour has a minority government in the [[Welsh Assembly Government|Welsh Assembly]], is the main opposition party in the [[Scottish Parliament]] and has [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats|13 members]] in the [[Party of European Socialists|European Parliament]]. The Labour Party is a member of the [[Socialist International]]. The Party's current leader is [[Ed Miliband]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]].

==Party ideology==
Throughout its history, the Labour Party has usually been thought of as being [[left wing]] or [[centre-left]] in its politics. Officially, it has maintained the stance of being a [[socialism|socialist]] party ever since its inception, currently describing itself as a &quot;[[Clause IV#Blair's fight|democratic socialist party]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;iqgxtf&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name =hww /&gt; The party has been described as a [[broad church]],&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Meredith: Theorising the Third Way: http://www.psa.ac.uk/cps/2002/meredith.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; containing a diversity of ideological trends from strongly socialist, to more moderately social democratic, and in recent years pro-market tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/news/Labour-conference-Brown-to-stand.4518952.jp&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout its history, it has been criticised by other leftist commentators and historians for not being truly socialist in its policies, instead supporting anti-socialist stances such as [[capitalism]] and [[neo-colonialism]] and has been described as a &quot;capitalist workers' party&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cliff, Tony and Gluckstein, Donny (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically the party was broadly in favour of socialism, as set out in [[Clause IV|Clause Four]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labourcounts.com/clausefour.htm |title=Labour - Clause IV |publisher=Labourcounts.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the original party constitution, and advocated socialist policies such as [[public ownership]] of key industries, [[Economic intervention|government intervention]] in the economy, [[Income redistribution|redistribution]] of wealth, increased rights for workers, the [[welfare state]], publicly-funded healthcare and education. Beginning in the late-1980s continuing to the current day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/apr/07/labour-pro-business-ed-miliband | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Helene | last=Mulholland | title=Labour will continue to be pro-business, says Ed Miliband | date=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the party has adopted [[free market]] policies, leading many observers to describe the Labour Party as [[social democracy|social democratic]] or [[Third Way social democracy|Third Way]], rather than democratic socialist.&lt;ref&gt;''New Labour and Thatcherism: Political Change in Britain'', Richard Heffernan, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://society.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,7884,1013219,00.html New Labour has picked up where Thatcherism left off], [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], The Guardian, 6 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070724191435/http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fss/sociology/papers/jessop-from-thatcherism-to-new-labour.pdf From Thatcherism to New Labour: Neo-Liberalism, Workfarism and Labour Market Regulation], Professor [[Bob Jessop]], Lancaster University.

Party electoral manifestos have not contained the term ''socialism'' since 1992, and in 1995 the original [[Clause IV|Clause Four]] was abolished. The new version states:

{{quote|The Labour Party is a democratic socialist party. It believes that by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone, so as to create for each of us the means to realise our true potential and for all of us a community in which power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not the few, where the rights we enjoy reflect the duties we owe, and where we live together, freely, in a spirit of solidarity, tolerance and respect.}}

==Party constitution and structure==
{{Main|Labour Party Rule Book}}
The Labour Party is a membership organisation consisting of [[Constituency Labour Parties]], [[affiliated trade unions]], [[socialist societies]] and the [[Co-operative Party]], with which it has an electoral agreement. Members who are elected to parliamentary positions take part in the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]] (PLP) and European Parliamentary Labour Party (EPLP). The party's decision-making bodies on a national level formally include the [[National Executive Committee]] (NEC), [[Labour Party Conference]] and [[National Policy Forum]] (NPF)—although in practice the Parliamentary leadership has the final say on policy. The 2008 [[Labour Party Conference]] was the first at which affiliated trade unions and Constituency Labour Parties did not have the right to submit motions on contemporary issues that would previously have been debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Anger over 'union debate limit' | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7002618.stm | publisher=BBC News | date=19 September 2007 | accessdate=13 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labour Party conferences now include more &quot;keynote&quot; addresses, guest speakers and question-and-answer sessions, while specific discussion of policy now takes place in the [[National Policy Forum]].

For many years Labour held to a policy of not allowing residents of [[Northern Ireland]] to apply for membership,&lt;ref&gt;{{wayback|www.labour.org.uk/join/form.html|Labour Party membership form}}, ca. 1999. via Internet Archive.

Chapter II: The Unloved, Unwanted Garrison. Via Conflict Archive on the Internet.

[[Image:ILP 21st anniversary certificate large.jpg|thumb|The [[Independent Labour Party]], founded in 1893]]

===Founding of the party===
The Labour Party's origins lie in the late 19th century, around which time it became apparent that there was a need for a new political party to represent the interests and needs of the urban proletariat, a demographic which had increased in number and had recently been given [[suffrage|franchise]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, the 1899 [[Lyons vs. Wilkins]] judgment, which limited certain types of picketing&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the trades union movement became interested in moving into the political field, and after further extensions of the voting franchise in 1867 and 1885, the Liberal Party endorsed some trade-union sponsored candidates. In addition, several small socialist groups had formed around this time, with the intention of linking the movement to political policies. Among these were the [[Independent Labour Party]], the intellectual and largely middle-class [[Fabian Society]], the [[Social Democratic Federation]] and the [[Scottish Labour Party (1888–1893)|Scottish Labour Party]].

It was during this period that British socialism began to make headway in local government. In 1889, a &quot;Progressive&quot; party composed of [[Fabians]] and [[British Liberals]] took control of London County Council at the first elections held there. This was the first council to have substantial socialist influence, and carried out a programme of municipalisation, while constructing some of the first social housing in England and increasing public spending on services such as the Fire Brigade.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;  In addition, the number of parks and public baths were increased, London’s sewage system was improved, roads were widened and paved, and the [[Blackwall Tunnel]], linking the Isle of Dogs with Greenwich, was opened in 1897.&lt;ref name=&quot;localleadership.gov.uk&quot;&gt;http://www.localleadership.gov.uk/docs/Leading%20the%20way%5B1%5D.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Women’s Labour League]], which was active in the field of social policy, set up a child welfare clinic in Kensington before the outbreak of [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harmer&quot;&gt;The Longman Companion to The Labour Party 1900-1998 by Harry Harmer&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892, [[Fred Jowett]] a member of the Independent Labour Party) became the first socialist to be elected to [[Bradford City Council]]. A few months later, Jowett founded a branch of the Independent Labour Party in that city. As a member of Bradford City Council, Jowett was responsible for the passage of several important reforms that were eventually imitated by other local authorities. In 1904, for instance, [[Bradford]] became the first local authority in Britain to provide [[free school meal]]s, while a successful campaign led to the clearing of a slum area and its replacement with new houses. Jowett was also a supporter of reforming the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|1834 Poor Law]], and attempted to improve the quality of the food given to the children in the [[Little_Horton#Little_Horton_in_the_Industrial_Age|Bradford Workhouse]] after being elected as a [[Poor Law Guardians|Poor Law Guardian]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/TUjowett.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1898, West Ham borough became the first ever Labour council.&lt;ref&gt;Currents of Radicalism: Popular Radicalism, Organised Labour and Party Politics in Britain, 1850-1914 by Eugenio F. Biagini and Alastair J. Reid&lt;/ref&gt; The new administration embarked on a programme involving the enlargement of the municipal workforce and bringing it directly under public control in order to improve job security, conditions, and pay for workers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nextleft.org/2010/07/why-keir-hardie-rejected-liberals.html&lt;/ref&gt; A minimum wage and an eight-hour workday were introduced for council employees, together with a fortnight’s annual holiday. Although Labour lost its majority two years later, its achievements in the council demonstrated Labour’s effectiveness at instigating reform at a municipal level.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pugh&quot;&gt;Speak for Britain! A New History of the Labour Party by Martin Pugh&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1895|1895 general election]], the Independent Labour Party put up 28 candidates but won only 44,325 votes. [[Keir Hardie]], the leader of the party, believed that to obtain success in parliamentary elections, it would be necessary to join with other left-wing groups. Hardie's roots as a Methodist lay preacher contributed to an ethos in the party which led to the comment by 1950s General Secretary Morgan Phillips that &quot;Socialism in Britain owed more to Methodism than Marx&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;p.131 The Foundations of the British Labour Party by Matthew Worley ISBN 9780754667315&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour Representation Committee===
[[Image:jameskeirhardie.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Keir Hardie]], one of the Labour Party's founders and its first leader]]

In 1899, a [[Doncaster]] member of the [[Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants]], Thomas R. Steels, proposed in his union branch that the [[Trade Union Congress]] call a special conference to bring together all left-wing organisations and form them into a single body that would sponsor Parliamentary candidates. The motion was passed at all stages by the TUC, and the proposed conference was held at the Memorial Hall on Farringdon Street on 26 and 27 February 1900. The meeting was attended by a broad spectrum of working-class and left-wing organisations&amp;nbsp;— trades unions represented about one third of the membership of the TUC delegates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialisthistorysociety.co.uk/MORTIMER.HTM ‘The formation of the Labour Party - Lessons for today’] Jim Mortimer, 2000; Jim Mortimer was a General Secretary of the Labour Party in the 1980s&lt;/ref&gt;

After a debate, the 129 delegates passed Hardie's motion to establish &quot;a distinct Labour group in Parliament, who shall have their own whips, and agree upon their policy, which must embrace a readiness to cooperate with any party which for the time being may be engaged in promoting legislation in the direct interests of labour.&quot; This created an association called the '''Labour Representation Committee''' (LRC), meant to coordinate attempts to support MPs sponsored by trade unions and represent the working-class population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labour.org.uk/history_of_the_labour_party |title=History of the Labour Party |publisher=Labour Party |date=27 February 2010|accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had no single leader, and in the absence of one, the Independent Labour Party nominee [[Ramsay MacDonald]] was elected as Secretary. He had the difficult task of keeping the various strands of opinions in the LRC united. The [[United Kingdom general election, 1900|October 1900]] &quot;Khaki election&quot; came too soon for the new party to campaign effectively; total expenses for the election only came to £33.&lt;ref&gt;Wright T. &amp; Carter M, (1997) ''&quot;The People's Party&quot;'' Thames &amp; Hudson, ISBN 0-500-27956-X&lt;/ref&gt; Only 15 candidatures were sponsored, but two were successful; [[Keir Hardie]] in [[Merthyr Tydfil (UK Parliament constituency)|Merthyr Tydfil]] and [[Richard Bell (politician)|Richard Bell]] in [[Derby (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby]].&lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;&gt;Thorpe, Andrew (2001) ''A History Of The British Labour Party'', Palgrave, ISBN 0-333-92908-x&lt;/ref&gt;

Support for the LRC was boosted by the 1901 [[Taff Vale Case]], a dispute between strikers and a railway company that ended with the union being ordered to pay £23,000 damages for a strike. The judgment effectively made strikes illegal since employers could recoup the cost of lost business from the unions. The apparent acquiescence of the Conservative Government of [[Arthur Balfour]] to industrial and business interests (traditionally the allies of the Liberal Party in opposition to the Conservative's landed interests) intensified support for the LRC against a government that appeared to have little concern for the industrial proletariat and its problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:LabourPartyPlaque.jpg|thumb|left|Labour Party Plaque from Caroone House, 8 Farringdon Street]]

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|1906 election]], the LRC won 29 seats—helped by a [[Lib-Lab pact|secret 1903 pact]] between [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and Liberal [[Chief Whip]] [[Herbert John Gladstone(the lib/lab pact), 1st Viscount Gladstone|Herbert Gladstone]] that aimed to avoid splitting the opposition vote between Labour and Liberal candidates in the interest of removing the Conservatives from office.&lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;/&gt;

In their first meeting after the election the group's Members of Parliament decided to adopt the name &quot;The Labour Party&quot; formally (15 February 1906). Keir Hardie, who had taken a leading role in getting the party established, was elected as Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party (in effect, the Leader), although only by one vote over [[David Shackleton]] after several ballots. In the party's early years the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) provided much of its activist base as the party did not have individual membership until 1918 but operated as a conglomerate of affiliated bodies. The [[Fabian Society]] provided much of the intellectual stimulus for the party. One of the first acts of the new Liberal Government was to reverse the Taff Vale judgement,&lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;/&gt; while Labour parliamentarians encouraged and supported progressive measures such as the [[Workmen's Compensation Act 1906]], the [[Mines Act 1908]],&lt;ref&gt;British Economic and Social History 1700-1964 by C.P. Hill&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Old Age Pensions Act 1908]], and compulsory medical inspections in state schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceO&quot;/&gt; In 1906, the Labour Party scored its first ever legislative success in the new Parliament with the passage of a bill put forward by the Labour MP Fred Jowett in the form of the [[Education (Provision of Meals) Act 1906]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

===Early years and the rise of the Labour Party===
The [[United Kingdom general election, December 1910|1910 election]] saw 42 Labour MPs elected to the House of Commons, a significant victory since, a year before the election, the House of Lords had passed the [[Osborne judgment]] ruling that Trades Unions in the United Kingdom could no longer donate money to fund the election campaigns and wages of Labour MPs. The governing Liberals were unwilling to repeal this judicial decision with primary legislation. The height of Liberal compromise was to introduce a wage for Members of Parliament to remove the need to involve the Trade Unions. By 1913, faced with the opposition of the largest Trades Unions, the Liberal government passed the Trade Disputes Act to allow Trade Unions to fund Labour MPs once more.

By 1914, there were about 420 labour representatives sitting on municipal Councils of various kinds, not including a few County councilors in the mining areas, or a much larger number on Boards of Guardians, Parish Councils, and District Councils. Aside from education, and the feeding and medical inspection and treatment of schoolchildren, the issues which the Labour Party pressed most urgently in local government were the local provision of work for the unemployed, the eight-hour workday, the adoption and enforcement of the fair Wages Clause in public contracts, and fair wages and conditions for local authority employees. In some areas (particularly Birmingham And Glasgow) there was active pressure in support of municipal housing and [[urban renewal|slum clearance]] schemes, while there was also continued agitation (in relation to the Board of guardians) for improved treatment both of the unemployed and other classes of paupers, particularly the disabled and the aged. House-building, midway between a public health service and a trading enterprise, became one of the main planks in the Labour municipal platform.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

During the First World War, the Labour Party split between supporters and opponents of the conflict but opposition to the war grew within the party as time went on. [[Ramsay MacDonald]], a notable anti-war campaigner, resigned as leader of the Parliamentary Labour Party and [[Arthur Henderson]] became the main figure of authority within the party.

In 1915, the Labour Party experienced ministerial office for the first time when leading members of the party were invited to join Herbert Asquith’s wartime government. The rationale behind this was that the government needed the co-operation of the trade union movement, and felt that one way of achieving was to provide Labour with ministerial positions. From that time onwards, the Labour Party remained a part of the wartime coalition until the end of hostilities in November 1918. The secretary of the Labour Party, Arthur Henderson, was accepted into [[H. H. Asquith|Prime Minister Asquith]]'s war cabinet (becoming the first Labour Party member to serve in government) as both President of the Board of Education and as unofficial adviser on labour issues, while minor positions were given to G.H. Roberts (a printer, who became a government whip) and William Bruce (a miner, who acquired an under-secretaryship). In December 1916, when the wartime coalition was reconstructed by David Lloyd George (Asquith’s successor as prime minister), Henderson was promoted to the inner war cabinet, while [[George Nicoll Barnes|George Barnes]] of the engineers became Minister of Pensions and [[John Hodge (politician)|John Hodge]] of the steel workers became Minister of Labour. William Bruce, G.H. Roberts, and James Parker (another Labour MP) were offered minor posts.&lt;ref&gt;A Social History of the English Working Classes 1815-1945 by Eric Hopkins&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite mainstream Labour Party's support for the coalition, the [[Independent Labour Party]] was instrumental in opposing conscription through organisations such as the Non-Conscription Fellowship while a Labour Party affiliate, the [[British Socialist Party]], organised a number of unofficial strikes. Arthur Henderson resigned from the Cabinet in 1917 amid calls for party unity to be replaced by [[George Nicoll Barnes|George Barnes]]. 

During the course of the First World War, while serving both inside and outside of government, the Labour Party was able to influence a number of progressive developments in social policy. At a time when 90% of housing was privately rented, landlords sought to increase rents in the face of rising wartime prices (and in some cases as a means of profiteering). This resulted in a range of largely spontaneous protests in 1915 which were then often co-ordinated by local Labour movements, such as that in Glasgow, where the ILP played a leading role. This forced the government to pass legislation which fixed wartime rents at pre-war levels. This was significant in that it showed labour to be the party that would defend working-class interests in housing, more than its rivals, while also helping Labour to move away from trade union related issues towards areas which some direct appeal to women, in particular. In addition, as argued by Andrew Thorpe, it also “added credibility to the idea of state action to control market forces which disadvantaged the working class.”&lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;/&gt;

The Labour Party also campaigned for “fair shares,” attacking profiteering and unrestricted market forces, and secured some advances by applying pressure on the government. The Labour Party pushed hard for high taxation of war profits, rationing, and other controls, and in 1917, price controls were introduced which stabilised food prices, while rationing, which came into operation at the beginning of 1918, ensured  degree of “fair play.” An excess profits duty was also introduced in 1915 which stood at 80% by 1917, and Labour’s credentials were further established by the WEC’s “Conscription of Riches” campaign, launched in 1916.

The wartime experience of the Labour ministers made them feel more confident of their party’s ability to use the machinery of state to bring about social change, and encouraged them to resist policies &quot;direct action&quot; urged by local ''Soviets'' and the fledgling [[Communist Party of Great Britain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pugh&quot;/&gt;

The growth in Labour's local activist base and organisation was reflected in the elections following the war, the [[co-operative]] movement now providing its own resources to the [[Co-operative Party]] after the armistice. The Co-operative Party later reached an electoral agreement with the Labour Party.  The [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] was refused affiliation between 1921 and 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/redclyde/redcly140.htm |title=Red Clydeside: The Communist Party and the Labour government [booklet cover&amp;#93; / Communist Party of Great Britain, 1924 |publisher=Glasgow Digital Library|date= |accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Meanwhile the Liberal Party declined rapidly and the party suffered a catastrophic split that allowed the Labour Party to co-opt much of the Liberals' support.

With the Liberals in disarray Labour won 142 seats in [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|1922]], making it the second largest political group in the House of Commons and the [[Official Opposition (UK)|official opposition]] to the Conservative government. After the election the now-rehabilitated Ramsay MacDonald was voted the first official [[List of United Kingdom Labour Party leaders|leader of the Labour Party]].

===First Labour government (1924)===
[[Image:Ramsay MacDonald ggbain.29588.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ramsay MacDonald]]: First Labour Prime Minister, 1924 and 1929–31]]
The [[United Kingdom general election, 1923|1923 general election]] was fought on the Conservatives' [[protectionist]] proposals but, although they got the most votes and remained the largest party, they lost their majority in parliament, necessitating the formation of a government supporting [[free trade]]. Thus, with the acquiescence of Asquith's Liberals, [[Ramsay MacDonald]] became  the first ever Labour Prime Minister in January 1924, forming the first Labour government, despite Labour only having 191 MPs (less than a third of the House of Commons).

Because the government had to rely on the support of the Liberals it was unable to get any legislation of an arguably socialist nature passed by the House of Commons. The most significant and long-lasting measure was the [[Wheatley Housing Act]], which began a building programme of 500,000 homes for rental to working-class families. Legislation on education, unemployment and social insurance were also passed.

The government collapsed after only nine months when the Liberals voted for a Select Committee inquiry into the [[Patrick Hastings#Campbell Case|Campbell Case]], a vote which MacDonald had declared to be a vote of confidence. The ensuing [[United Kingdom general election, 1924|general election]] saw the publication, four days before polling day, of the notorious [[Zinoviev letter]], which implicated Labour in a plot for a Communist revolution in Britain. The Conservatives were returned to power although Labour increased its vote from 30.7% to a third of the popular vote, most Conservative gains being at the expense of the Liberals. The Zinoviev letter is now known to have been a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article1819658.ece|title=The truth about Churchill's spy chief and the Zinoviev Letter|work=The Independent |location=UK | location=London | first=Francis | last=Elliott | date=8 October 2006 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In opposition Ramsay MacDonald continued his policy of presenting the Labour Party as a moderate force. During the [[UK General Strike of 1926|General Strike of 1926]] he opposed strike action, arguing that the best way to achieve social reforms was through the ballot box.

===Second Labour government (1929–1931)===
In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|1929 general election]], the Labour Party became the largest in the House of Commons for the first time, with 287 seats and 37.1% of the popular vote. However MacDonald was still reliant on Liberal support to form a minority government. MacDonald went on to appoint Britain's first female cabinet minister, [[Margaret Bondfield]], who was appointed [[Secretary of State for Employment|Minister of Labour]].

The government, however, soon found itself engulfed in crisis: the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and eventual [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]] occurred soon after the government came to power, and the crisis hit Britain hard. By the end of 1930 unemployment had doubled to over two and a half million.&lt;ref name=&quot;To Build A New Jerusalem&quot;&gt;Davies, A. J. (1996) ''To Build A New Jerusalem: The British Labour Party from Keir Hardie to Tony Blair'', Abacus, ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; The government had no effective answers to the crisis. A sudden budgeting crisis in the summer of 1931 split the cabinet over whether the rate of unemployment benefit should be reduced; when it became clear that leading Ministers who were opposed would resign, the Government could no longer continue.

To the surprise of fellow Ministers, MacDonald returned from seeing the King having agreed to head a &quot;[[National Government (UK)|National Government]]&quot; with [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and [[The Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Ministers. A small number of Labour ministers joined him, causing great anger among those within the Labour Party who felt betrayed by MacDonald's actions: he and his supporters were later expelled from the Labour Party. Arthur Henderson returned to the party leadership and repudiated all spending cuts. When the economic crisis did not abate, the National Government called a [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|general election]] and won an overwhelming victory (MacDonald's supporters having formed a scratch [[National Labour Organisation|National Labour]] group). The election was a disaster for the Labour Party which won only 46 seats, together with 3 for the [[Independent Labour Party]] and 3 Labour candidates who did not have official endorsement. The total of 52 was 225 fewer than in 1929.

===In opposition during the 1930s===
Arthur Henderson, elected in 1931 to succeed MacDonald, lost his seat in the [[UK general election, 1931|1931 general election]]. The only former Labour cabinet member who had retained his seat, the pacifist [[George Lansbury]], accordingly became party leader.

The party experienced another split in 1932 when the [[Independent Labour Party]], which for some years had been increasingly at odds with the Labour leadership, opted to disaffiliate from the Labour Party and embarked on a long, drawn-out decline.

Lansbury resigned as leader in 1935 after public disagreements over foreign policy. He was promptly replaced as leader by his deputy, Clement Attlee, who would lead the party for two decades. The party experienced a revival in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|1935 general election]], winning 154 seats and 38% of the popular vote, the highest that Labour had achieved. In 1938, the Labour Party scored a parliamentary victory with the passage of Ellen Wilkinson’s High Purchase Act. Aimed at protecting working-class consumers which required traders to display on goods the actual cash price plus the sum added for interest, and safeguarding hirers &quot;who had paid at least one third of the sum contracted.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/TUwilkinson.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

As the threat from [[Nazi Germany]] increased in the 1930s the Labour Party gradually abandoned its earlier pacifist stance and supported re-armament, largely due to the efforts of [[Ernest Bevin]] and [[Hugh Dalton]] who by 1937 had also persuaded the party to oppose [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s policy of [[appeasement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;To Build A New Jerusalem&quot;/&gt;

===Local Labour reforms in the inter-war period===
[[Image:Oldlabour2.png|thumb|upright|The original &quot;Liberty&quot; logo, in use until 1983]]
Although Labour remained out of office for most of the inter-war period, it was able to control of many local authorities and put its socialist principles into practice on a small scale.

{{quote
| text = The Labour-controlled local authorities, and also those in which Labour was the strongest single party, had in practice to concentrate mainly on making the most of the opportunities offered to them by national legislation – especially in the fields of housing, education, public health services, and, after 1929, the services transferred to them from the Boards of Guardians. In all these fields, Labour had a notably good local government record.

During the interwar period, Labour in local government sought to use the power of municipal authority to improve the working and living environments of its primarily working-class constituents. The functions of local government provided Labour Party members with experience in office, and provided them with the opportunity to improve the living standards of its constituents through measures such as improvements in housing and health care, the provision of maternity clinics, and free milk and meals for schoolchildren.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceO&quot;/&gt; Following the end of [[World War I]], Labour councillors returned in 1919 adopted a policy of municipal socialism (particularly in boroughs of London to tackle social problems such as poor health, inadequate housing, and general insecurity. Labour in local government sought to establish a &quot;proto-welfare state&quot; through, for instance, the elected Boards of Guardians, paying more generous levels of poor relief to the jobless and encouraging the construction of clinics, houses, and municipal baths which, apart from providing necessary services, also provided employment opportunities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harmer&quot;/&gt; Also, although Labour groups often remained in the minority on their respective councils, they and their supporters mounted campaigns to safeguard and extend people’s standard of living. For example, minority Labour groups could block council initiatives that they saw as going against the interests of their constituents.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceO&quot;/&gt;

Housing was one of the most pressing concerns of the Labour Party from 1918 onwards. In response to David Lloyd George’s promise of &quot;homes fit for heroes,&quot; Labour borough councils in London which were elected in 1919 acted quickly to improve the standard of living of their constituents. In Camberwell, the Labour council of 1919-22 constructed 450 council houses, while in Poplar, the labour council embarked on a house-building programme, extended the borough’s electricity undertaking, and put pressure on landlords to make essential repairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceO&quot;/&gt; Labour-controlled authorities also directly intervened in the working of casual labour markets.

The Labour Metropolitan Councils of Poplar, Stepney, Shoreditch, and Bethnal Green all introduced minimum wages of £4 a week for male employees, a provision that Poplar extended to female workers. Casual staffs were also provided with sick pay and holiday pay at the same time, while fair wages clauses extended these provisions and trade unionism to firms supplying local government contracts.&lt;ref name = Feldman /&gt;

Worthwhile reforms, such as allowing working-class families with no bathrooms to use public baths for free, formed an integral part of the council agenda of the Labour Party. In Islington, where the Labour party had a council majority, the borough party’s 1937 election campaign involved campaigns for a gynaecological clinic, a convalescence home, and improvements in maternity and child welfare. In 1919, Fulham set up a municipal laundry service, and in 1932, Walthamstow set up a municipal savings bank. In Hackney, the municipality profitably administrated the borough’s electricity supply, council houses were constructed, a municipal insurance scheme was established, and council employees replaced contractors in collecting the refuse of the borough.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceO&quot;/&gt;

In Bermondsey, the Labour council led by Alfred Salter and his wife Ada Salter introduced an extensive network of health centres and clinics,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;The Labour Party: A Centenary History edited by Brian Brivati and Richard Hefferman&lt;/ref&gt; while also making improvements to environmental and housing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infed.org/socialaction/alfred_salter.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Municipal health centres, clinics, and baths were established, while 2,700 houses were built between 1929 and 1938. A &quot;beautification committee&quot; was set up to brighten up the borough, which planted over 9,000 trees and launched gardening competitions to encourage public participation. The Salters also converted their country house at Fairby Grange into a convalescence home for mothers, and although they had lost their own daughter to scarlet fever, the Salters strove to raise the health of the borough through the distribution of free milk, food, and insulin to those in need, the opening of a solarium to fight off TB, and the launching of health propaganda campaigns. In Tredegar, efforts were made to improve access to health care with the introduction of a Medical Aid Association, which covered 90% of the town’s population by 1944. in Lincoln, the council’s maternity and child welfare centre was, in the words of Matthew Worley, &quot;the jewel in Labour’s municipal crown.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceO&quot;/&gt;

In Norwich, where Labour took office in 1933, a housing programme was carried out which led to the construction of 5,000 houses by 1935, with &quot;fair rents&quot; set for council tenants. Improvements were also made in health care and unemployment relief, while labour councillors emphasised their provision of nutritious school meals and building of hygienic schools and nurseries to provide an &quot;equal opportunity to every child, however poor their parents may be.&quot; In Kingston, during the Thirties, Labour members campaigned to ensure the enforcement of housing regulations, organising tenants’ rallies of some 2,000 people. In Poplar, a wide range of reforms were carried out, including the organisation of social events on Saturday nights, an expansion of library services, the introduction of a free milk scheme, the opening of public baths on Sundays, and the opening of a TB dispensary. Certain labour councils, such as in Swindon, also placed greater emphasis on the quality of working-class housing than others. In Islington, the council had limited success in converting houses into flats.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceO&quot;/&gt;

Some other Labour councils such as West Ham and Bedwellty also continued to provide levels of poor relief above the government recommendation into the mid-to-late Twenties,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceO&quot;/&gt; although they remained the exception rather than the rule. 

In Barnsley, the Labour council raised the school leaving age, while in St. Helens, a massive investment was made in education. In Glasgow (where a minority Labour administration took office in 1933), 60,000 houses had built by Glasgow Corporation by the Labour council and its predecessors by 1947. Labour briefly controlled the (then) middle-class borough in Hackney from 1919 to 1922, during which time it reduced the rate demand to the lowest in England.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; A plan in Leeds to demolish and replace all the [[back-to-back houses]] by five-year stages was accepted by the council in 1933 under the inspiration of the [[Reverend]] [[Rev. Charles Jenkinson|Charles Jenkinson]], a Labour Party member who became the leader of their council when Labour won control of it in 1933. Out of the 72,000 back-to-back houses in Leeds, 8,000 were replaced by 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Britain Between The Wars 1918-1940 by Charles Loch Mowat&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, Sheffield came under the control of the Labour Party, and became the first major city in Britain to enjoy sustained Labour control. The first Labour administration in Sheffield carried out a broad range of important social reforms which made it a source of immense pride for many in the Labour party and, until London county Council was gained by Labour in 1934, was &quot;labour’s municipal showcase.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; The Sheffield Labour group, led by Ernest Rowlinson, widened educational opportunities and standards, extended Sheffield’s transport network, built improved municipal housing, carried out slum clearances, and erected public abattoirs and a hospital for people who suffered from tuberculosis. After the holding of a referendum in 1939, the Labour council agreed to provide land and leases for the building of local pubs, while money was set aside in 1939 for the construction of recreational facilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceO&quot;/&gt; A massive slum clearance programme was carried out, with 10,000 new houses constructed and some the old slum areas renovated, while investments were made in schools and health centres. A cheap transport policy was launched, with a 25% reduction in fares and the introduction of free travel for he disabled on trams. Welfare provisions were also extended, with workless households compensated in full for the 1931 cut in unemployment benefit. Profits from municipal trams, electricity, and their trading were used to improve services instead of reducing rates.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; The Sheffield Labour council also invested in baths and other public services. Various provisions were made for maternity and child welfare, public abattoirs were constructed (together with a fever hospital for tuberculosis cases), and frequent quality checks on milk were carried out as a public health measure.&lt;ref&gt;The Dynamics of Working-class Politics: The Labour Movement in Preston, 1880-1940 by Michael Savage&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, these policies contributed to a dramatic fall in the local death rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;FirstCentury&quot;&gt;Labour’s First Century by Duncan Tanner, Pat Thane, and Nick Tiratsoo&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Great Depression, Labour councils made great efforts to protect unemployed people from the worst effects of the slump,&lt;ref&gt;Welfare State and Welfare Change by Martin Powell and Martin Hewitt&lt;/ref&gt; and sought to ensure that the public assistance system for the needy was made as generous as possible. In Durham and Glamorgan, the Labour administrations there paid more than the minimum, while operating the means test more humanely than they were supposed to.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; In Hackney, the London Labour Party secretary Herbert Morrison resorted to charitable methods to counteract the effects of unemployment.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceO&quot;/&gt; In Nelson, the Labour council of the Thirties invested in essential servicse like education and child welfare.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pendlelabour.com/PDF/TheGazetteMay7_1935.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In Glasgow, Patrick Dollan’s Glasgow corporation carried out a slum-clearance programme that resulted in the construction of some 200,000 homes between 1934 and 1939. In Barnsley, the school-leaving age was raised by six months in order to promote education and keep some 500 teenagers off the unemployment figure. In addition, priority was given to housing construction and slum clearances.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceO&quot;/&gt;

Labour authorities also sought to humanise the services provided by local authorities, together with enabling reducing the harshness of the way in which welfare services operated and enabling working-class people to enjoy the benefits of open space and culture. In Norwich, Labour ensured that school architecture was made bright and modern, while the Labour administration in Glasgow put an end to a controversial system in which elderly couples claiming poor relief could be split up into separate hostel units. In many Labour authorities such as Norwich and West Ham, assistance was given to poor mothers as well as the disabled. 

Labour representatives on the Boards of Guardians in the Twenties and on the Public Assistance Committees of the early Thirties sought to offset the effects of unemployment and poverty as best as they could within existing structures. This often led to interventionist measures such as the provision of free school meals or ensuring that benefit claimants received the relief that was owed to them. Labour councils sought to administer the means test in the most favourable terms possible, which involved accepting a higher percentage of applications for transitional benefit than in non-Labour localities and providing the maximum rate of relief available. In Poplar, Bethnal Green, and Stepney, for instance, Labour took positive steps on behalf of its working-class supporters, providing protection, jobs, and relief at a time of economic uncertainty.
&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceO&quot;/&gt;

Female Labour members played an active role in the policy-making of local labour councils, and the extension of accepted (or expected) municipal responsibility brought politics into areas to which women were the acknowledged experts. As recalled by Hannah Mitchell, when she sat on relief committees she &quot;knew just how much food could be bought out of the allowance, knew the cost of children’s clothes and footwear, could tell at a glance if an applicant was in ill health.&quot; Through first-hand knowledge of such issues, women contributed to the implementation of reforms which benefited their constituents, such as the building of wash houses, maternity centres, health clinics, playgrounds, and parks. These reforms not only extended Labour’s appeal, but also provided women with &quot;a distinctive place within Labour and municipal politics.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceO&quot;/&gt;

The Labour Party also enjoyed a strong following in Wales, where in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|1935 general election]] it won 8 out of 35 seats. In regards to social legislation (including health, housing, and education), the Labour-controlled authorities were both progressive in outlook and generous in spending. This meant that, despite extreme poverty, South Wales (where Labour was strong), had better outcomes in health, housing, and education than other parts of Wales, and this despite the poverty of the councils themselves. For instance, Glamorgan, Carmarthenshire, parts of Monmouthshire and Wrexham provided free school meals, while provision of this kind was exceptional in most of North Wales. A move towards expanding secondary school places to be filled on merit was also far more evident in authorities controlled by the Labour Party. In the most industrialised parts of Wales, Labour-dominated councils successfully tried not only to increase the number of secondary-school places (even during the years of the Great depression), but also worked towards providing these places free, and therefore on merit, instead of on ability to pay. By 1932, over 60% of places were free, a far higher figure than in England.&lt;ref&gt;Modern Wales: a concise history by Gareth Elwyn Jones&lt;/ref&gt; In Rhondda, the dominant Labour council introduced progressive measures such as free milk for children from poor households which helped to counteract some of the worst effects of the Great Depression, while in Swansea, a government grant was obtained to finance a number of civic building projects, the means test was exercised relatively humanely, and a nursery school was opened.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceO&quot;&gt;Labour Inside the Gate: A History of the British Labour Party between the Wars by Matthew Worley&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest breakthrough for Labour in local government came in 1934, with the capture of the most powerful local authority in Britain, the LCC. Under the leadership of [[Herbert Morrison]], the Labour-run LCC implemented a wide range of progressive social democratic reforms which transformed London into a model of responsible and progressive local Labour government.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; A year after taking office, Morrison took steps to raised the rates of London householders to 31% (seven shillings in the pound), and had run through what was termed a &quot;nest egg&quot; of £2,000,000 he had found upon taking office, salted away in London County Council’s treasury by Conservatives. This money was used in treating London’s poor more humanely, providing more homes for the aged poor, more free education, and modernising hospitals, improving their dietary and increasing their numbers of staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,883244,00.html | work=Time | title=Foreign News: Egg to Poor | date=11 March 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As leader of the LCC, Morrison presided over the development of London's housing, health, education and transport services, together with the unification of the transport system and creating a 'green belt' around London's suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/TUmorrison.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, new schools were constructed,&lt;ref name=&quot;localleadership.gov.uk&quot;/&gt; measures to combat corruption and inefficiency were carried out, a major programme of slum clearance and council house construction was carried out, and a municipal health service was set up, which became a model for the NHS.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; Led by Morrison and his [[presidium]] of Charles Latham, Isaac Hayward, and Lewis Silkin, the LCC provided to be a successful local Labour administration. An offensive was carried out against London’s slums, with new homes built, repairs carried out, and rents reduced for those moving to new municipal accommodation from slum areas. Spending on welfare services, education, and health care was increased from 1934 onwards, with more staff  employed in hospitals and enjoying better pay and conditions. More free places in secondary education were offered, improvements were made in patient care, new schools were constructed, and more amenities were provided, with the initiation of more milk, playing fields, and health visits. The LCC also made efforts to ensure that reforms were carried out to reduce the harshness of public assistance. Morrison’s plans for a &quot;[[green belt]]&quot; surrounding London also came to fruition, which provided the relevant local authorities with funds to purchase and maintain land.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceO&quot;/&gt; 

One Labour council that acquired great notoriety during the inter-war period was that of Poplar. Dedicated to improving the lives of poor working-class people, the Labour Poor Law Guardians paid generous scales of relief to the poor that led them to fall into debt. The Labour Guardians refused to hand over payments to London County Council that they were supposed to make, and were imprisoned in 1921.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood&quot;&gt;The British Welfare State, 1900-1950 by Sydney Wood&lt;/ref&gt;

The Poplar Guardians justified the generous scales of relief they paid out, together with their abandonment of principles of less eligibility in terms of a politics of redistribution of the financial burden of unemployment, stating that

}}
The actions of the Labour Guardians were arguably justified on the grounds that Poplar carried a heavier burden than many other boroughs in carrying the costs of poor relief. In 1921, for instance, Poplar had a rateable value of £4m and 86,500 unemployed persons to support, while other, richer councils could call on a rateable value of £15 to support only 4,800 unemployed. George Lansbury, the new mayor of Poplar, proposed that the Council stop collecting the rates for outside, cross-London bodies. This was agreed and on 31st March 1921, Poplar Council set a rate of 4s 4d instead of 6s 10d.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PRlansbury.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their imprisonment, the Labour Guardians refused to give way, and were released six weeks after their imprisoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood&quot;/&gt; In addition,the actions of the Poplar councillors in demanding that the burden of the rates be shared more equitably between poorer and richer boroughs led to the passage of legislation which provided for the greater equality between boroughs that they had demanded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harmer&quot;/&gt; Poplar no longer had to carry an unduly heavy burden as all London areas now shared the costs of poor relief in the future. Poplar continued to provide relatively generous scales of relief, paying £2 19s 6d to a family of seven instead of the agreed London rate of London rate of £2 14s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood&quot;/&gt;

Labour councils also endeavoured to present themselves as model employers. By the Thirties, for instance, most Labour councils had set up municipal works departments, carrying out repair work and construction without having to use a private contractor. Labour council employees also tended to be paid at (or above) trade union wage rates and were subject to union-recognised conditions. In Poplar, the Labour council that was elected in 1919 immediately agreed to, and increased, a minimum wage for all employees. Labour councils sought to employ direct labour to embark on their municipal building schemes, such as in Wigan, where people who were employed to build the town’s municipal houses were subject to trade union pay, conditions, and holidays.  

===Wartime coalition (1940-1945)===
The party returned to government in 1940 as part of the [[Coalition Government|wartime coalition]]. When [[Neville Chamberlain]] resigned in the spring of 1940, incoming-[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] decided to bring the other main parties into a coalition similar to that of the First World War. Clement Attlee was appointed [[Lord Privy Seal]] and a member of the war cabinet, eventually becoming the United Kingdom's first [[Deputy Prime Minister]].

A number of other senior Labour figures also took up senior positions; the trade union leader Ernest Bevin, as [[Minister of Labour and National Service]], directed Britain's wartime economy and allocation of manpower, the veteran Labour statesman [[Herbert Morrison]] became [[Home Secretary]], [[Hugh Dalton]] was [[Minister of Economic Warfare]] and later [[President of the Board of Trade]], while [[A. V. Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Hillsborough|A. V. Alexander]] resumed the role he had held in the previous Labour Government as [[First Lord of the Admiralty]]. Labour also filled eight junior posts, a number which rose to seventeen by 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pugh&quot;/&gt; According to G.D.H. Cole, the basis of the Wartime Coalition was that the labour ministers would look after the [[Home Front]] (including the maintenance of important social services and the mobilisation of manpower). Although the Exchequer remained in the hands of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], a firm understanding was made with Labour regarding the equitable distribution of tax burdens.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

While serving in coalition with the Conservatives, the Labour members of Churchill's cabinet were able put their democratic socialist ideals into practice, implementing a wide range of progressive social and economic reforms which did much to improve the living standards and working conditions of working-class Britons. As observed by [[Kenneth O. Morgan]], &quot;Labour ministers were uniquely associated with the  triumphs on the home front.&quot; [[Herbert Morrison]] at the Home Office, assisted by his friend [[Ellen Wilkinson]], was noted for his effective involvement in home defence and presiding over the repairs carried out on major cities affected by the Blitz.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morgan&quot;&gt;Labour in Power, 1945-1951 by Kenneth Morgan&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Greenwood]], in his capacity as minister without portfolio, commissioned the [[Beveridge Report]] which would lay the foundations for the post-war British welfare state.&lt;ref&gt;The Politics of social policy in the United States by Margaret Weir, Ann Shola Orloff, Project on the Federal Social Role (U.S.)&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the war years, the Labour Party was continuously active (with some success) in pushing for better arrangements of housing and billeting both of evacuees and of workers transferred for war services to already congested industrial areas, for fair systems of food rationing and distribution, for more effective control of prices, and for improvements in service pay and allowances. Labour also pressed hard for better provisions for the victims of air warfare, for more and better civic and industrial restaurants and canteens, and for war-time nurseries for the children of female workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;A History of the Labour Party from 1914 by G.D.H. Cole&lt;/ref&gt;

In a manifesto on &quot;The Peace,&quot; adopted by the 1941 Labour Party Annual Conference, it was claimed that Labour’s participation in the Wartime coalition Government had been effective in that, a year after Labour had joined the government,  the war was now being fought not only with much greater efficiency, but with a higher regard for social equity as well:

{{quote|The area of the social services has been increased.  Largely through the care and determination of the Trade unions, the standard of life has been well safeguarded. The health of the workers has been protected by the maintenance of the factory codes, and by the institution of factory doctors, canteens, and nurseries. Labour, national and local, has taken its share in civil defence; and in every sphere its activities have done much to improve the provision for the safety and comfort of citizens. The social protection of our people has been facilitated by the alert and continuous watch which has been kept over financial policy. Interest rates have been kept down. The Treasury has assumed powers over the Banks which assure their full co-operation in the policy upon which Parliament decides. The dangers of inflation, ever present in war-time, have been kept to a minimum.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;}}

According to the historian [[G.D.H. Cole]], Labour’s claims were arguably justified: profiteering was kept down, and there was greater equity both in the allocation of supplies and in taxation. In addition, social services were not merely kept up, but also expanded to meet wartime needs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

[[Tom Johnston (politician)|Tom Johnston]] used his position as [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] to push through a range of important developmental initiatives, such as the development of hydroelectricity in the Highlands, while [[Hugh Dalton’s]] regional policies directly assisted some of the Labour Party’s strongest cores of support.&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Labour Party by Andrew Thorpe&lt;/ref&gt; The Distribution of Industry Act 1945, pushed through by Hugh Dalton before the end of the wartime coalition, launched a vigorous policy of regenerating &quot;depressed areas&quot; such as industrial Scotland, the North-East of England, Cumbria, and South Wales, while diversifying the economic base of these regions. This foundation of this vigorous regional policy were actually laid during the Second World War, with the extension of the role of the trading estates and the linking of the industrial base of areas like the Welsh mining areas with the operations of government ordinance and armaments plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morgan&quot;/&gt; [[James Chuter Ede]], a Labour politician who served as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education, worked together with the conservative politician [[Rab Butler]] in drafting the [[1944 Education Act]],&lt;ref&gt;A Century of Change: 1837-Today by R.J. Unstead&lt;/ref&gt; while also playing a major role in its passage.&lt;ref&gt;The making of the 1944 Education Act by Michael Barber&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-operators, in common with the trade unions and labour, pressed hard from the outset of the war for the extension of the food rationing system to cover all essential supplies, arguing that the existence of an unrationed sector would create class injustices and result in time wasted on seeking supplies from shop to shop. Labour responded to Co-operative demands on these issues in March 1941 by establishing a Food Deputation Committee to work for more effective control and rationing of food supplies, together with the creation of an effective Consumers’ Council.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

As [[Minister of Labour and National Service]], [[Ernest Bevin]] did much to improve working conditions, raising the wages of the lowest paid male workers, such as miners, railwaymen, and agricultural labourers, while also persuading and forcing employers, under threat of removal of their Essential Works Order, to improve company medical and welfare provision, together with sanitary and safety provisions.  This was important both for improving working conditions and for cementing worker consent to the war effort, and as a result of Bevin’s efforts, doctors, nurses, and welfare officers multiplied on the shop floor while there was a threefold increase in the provision of works canteens. Almost 5,000 canteens were directly created by Bevin in controlled establishments, while a further 6,800 were set up by private employers by 1944. During the course of the war, the number of works doctors increased from 60 to about 1,000. This provision, however, was much more extensive within larger factories, with smaller employers continuing &quot;to barely comply with the minimum provision of a first aid box.&quot; Accident rates did, however, decline after 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

The Second World War also saw significant improvements in the position of trade unions, which were encouraged by Bevin. Trade unions were integrated into joint consultation at all levels of government and industry, with the TUC drawn in to represent labour on the National Joint Advisory Council (1939) and the joint Consultative Committee (1940). A similar status was bestowed upon employers’ organisations, which led Middlemass to argue that capital and organised labour had become &quot;governing institutions&quot; within a tripartite industrial relations system &quot;with the state at the fulcrum.&quot; The elevation of the status of organised labour to one of parity with capital in Whitehall was effectively summed up by Bevin’s biographer as such:

{{quote|The organised working class represented by the trade unions was for the first time brought into a position of partnership in the national enterprise of war – a partnership on equal not inferior terms, as in the First World War.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; }}

Collective bargaining was further extended by Bevin, who radically extended both the Wages Boards (the renamed Trades Boards) and the Whitley Committees, 46 of the latter were formed during the Second World War, and by the end of the war 15.5 million workers were covered by the minimum wage provisions by the Wages Boards. On the shop floor, Bevin directly encouraged the formation of joint production committees to extend worker’s participation in industry. By June 1944, almost 4,500 such committees were in existence, covering 3.5 million workers. By the end of the war, the joint production committees were intervening in areas once considered to be the sacrosanct domain of employers, such as health, welfare, transfers of labour, machine staffing, technology, piece rate fixing, and wage payment systems. These developments brought about significant improvements to conditions in the workplace, with a Mass Observation survey carried out in 1942 noting that &quot;the quick sack and the unexplained instability&quot; of the 1930s had practically vanished. During the 1940s, significant improvements in occupational health and safety standards were brought about both by the rising bargaining power of workers within the older &quot;staple&quot; sectors of the economy and the rise of &quot;the pro-active wartime and post-war state.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

Also in the 1940s, trade union power and authority was extended further than in British history up until that point, with labour’s ability to regulate and control work significantly enhanced during this period. This was assisted by developments such as full employment, the growth of union membership, rising from 32% to 45% of the workforce from 1939 to 1950 and increasing workplace representation, as characterised by the large increase in the number of shop stewards. The progressive social changes were continued in the initial post-war period, with the creation of the Welfare State (which placed a floor under wages) and the extension of the legal rights of unions through the repeal of the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act (1927) in 1946, while the 1948 Industrial Injuries Act provided compensation for accidents in the workplace.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

The war years also witnessed a significant extension of collective bargaining, which was directly encouraged by Bevin. By 1950, between nine and ten million workers were covered by collective voluntary bargaining. Bevin also established 46 new Joint Industrial Councils and extended the coverage of the Wages Boards between 1943 and 1945. By 1950, as a result of these changes, virtually all of the poorly organised and low-paid categories of workers were subject to state sponsored wage regulation and collective bargaining. This transformation in worker’s protection and bargaining power had the definitive effect of reducing long-established local and regional wage differences.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

Bevin was also responsible for the passage of the Determination of Needs Act in 1941, which finally abolished the long-detested household means test.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; After the passage of the Determination of Needs Act, the Labour Movement continued to press for improvements, particularly for the extension of the principles of the new legislation to cover Public Assistance and other services as well (at that time, it only covered the Assistance Board). In 1943, this was achieved by further legislation, which also improved conditions relating to supplementary pensions. Throughout the war period, the Labour movement (both in and out of Parliament) pressed successfully for a number of changes liberalising the administration of the social services.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

The Catering Wages Act (1943), another initiative by Bevin, established a Catering Wages Commission to oversee wages and working conditions in restaurants and hotels. Inspectors were also appointed to ensure that employers complied with Bevin’s insistence on the provision of canteens, welfare officers, and personnel officers in factories.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; Bevin also did much to improve conditions for those with disabilities, of which little had been done for before the outbreak of the war. In 1941, Bevin introduced an interim retraining scheme, which was followed by the interdepartmental Tomlinson Committee of the Rehabilitation and Resettlement of the Disabled. According to the historian [[Pat Thane]], the Committee served as &quot;a mouthpiece for Bevin’s own aspirations,&quot; and its proposals for improving the lives of the disabled culminated in the Disabled Persons Employment Act of 1944.&lt;ref&gt;The Foundations of the Welfare State by Pat Thane&lt;/ref&gt;

Bevin and the other Labour ministers were also able to ensure that, compared with the First World War, there was greater equality of sacrifice within society. Profiteering was effectively controlled, while rent controls and food subsidies helped to keep down wartime inflation. Wartime wages were allowed to increase in line with, and earnings to surpass, the rate of price inflation, while the tax system became more progressive, with taxation becoming heavier on the very rich (this movement towards greater progressivity was maintained under the Attlee government, with the top rate of income tax reaching 98% in 1949). These policies led to a narrowing of wealth inequalities, with the real value of wage incomes increasing by some 18% between 1938 and 1947, while the real value of property income fell by 15% and salaries by some 21% over that same period.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;A History of Work in Britain, 1880-1950 by Arthur McIvor&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war victory under Attlee===
[[Image:Attlee cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Clement Attlee]]: Labour Prime Minister, 1945–51]]
At the end of the war in Europe, in May 1945, Labour resolved not to repeat the Liberals' error of 1918 and promptly withdrew from government to contest the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]] in opposition to Churchill's Conservatives. Surprising many observers,&lt;ref name=BBCreport&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/26/newsid_3572000/3572175.stm|title=1945: Churchill loses general election|publisher=BBC News|date=26 July 1945|accessdate=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labour won a formidable victory, winning just under 50% of the vote with a majority of 145 seats.

Clement Attlee's government proved itself to be one of the most radical British governments of the 20th century, implementing the economic theories of [[John Maynard Keynes]], presiding over a policy of  nationalising major industries and utilities including the [[Bank of England]], coal mining, the steel industry, electricity, gas, telephones and inland transport including railways, road haulage and canals. It developed and implemented the &quot;cradle to grave&quot; [[welfare state]] conceived by the economist [[William Beveridge]]. To this day the party considers the 1948 creation of Britain's publicly funded [[National Health Service]] under health minister [[Aneurin Bevan]] its proudest achievement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labour.org.uk/proud/proud_to_be_labour Proud of the NHS at 60] Labour Party. Retrieved 15 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Attlee's government also began the process of dismantling the [[British Empire]] when it granted independence to India and Pakistan in 1947, followed by Burma (Myanmar) and Ceylon (Sri Lanka) the following year. At a secret meeting in January 1947, Attlee and six cabinet ministers, including Foreign Secretary [[Ernest Bevin]], decided to proceed with the development of Britain's [[Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|nuclear weapons programme]],&lt;ref name=&quot;To Build A New Jerusalem&quot;/&gt; in opposition to the pacifist and anti-nuclear stances of a large element inside the Labour Party.

Labour went on to win the [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|1950 general election]] but with a much reduced majority of five seats. Soon afterwards defence became a divisive issues within the party, especially defence spending (which reached a peak of 14% of GDP in 1951 during the [[Korean War]]),&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Sir George, ''Illustrated History Of Great Britain'', (1987) Octupus Books&lt;/ref&gt; straining public finances and forcing savings elsewhere. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, [[Hugh Gaitskell]], introduced charges for NHS dentures and spectacles, prompting Bevan, along with Harold Wilson (then President of the Board of Trade), to resign over the dilution of the principle of free treatment on which the NHS had been established.

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|1951 general election]], Labour narrowly lost to the Conservatives despite receiving the larger share of the popular vote, its highest ever vote numerically. Most of the changes introduced by the 1945–51 Labour government were accepted by the Conservatives and became part of the &quot;post war consensus&quot; that lasted until the late 1970s.

===Opposition during the 1950s===

In the decade following the Second World War, Labour councils stood as important players in the reconstruction of housing and city centres. In [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], under the leadership of the visionary but corrupt [[T. Dan Smith]], an accelerated &quot;modernisation&quot; of the city took place, as characterised by an ambitious programme of road construction and public building and the replacement of slum terraces with new innovative estates such as the Byker “wall.”&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;

Following the defeat of 1951 the party underwent a long period of thirteen years in opposition. The party suffered an ideological split during the 1950s while the postwar economic recovery, given the social effects of Attlee's reforms, made the public broadly content with the Conservative governments of the time. Attlee remained as leader until his retirement in 1955.

His replacement [[Hugh Gaitskell]], a man associated with the right-wing of the party, struggled to deal with internal divisions in the late 1950s and early 1960s and Labour lost the [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959 general election]]. In 1963 Gaitskell's sudden death from a heart-attack made way for Harold Wilson to lead the party.

===Labour in government under Wilson (1964–1970)===
A down-turn in the economy along with a series of scandals in the early 1960s (the most notorious being the [[Profumo affair]]) engulfed the Conservative government by 1963. The Labour Party returned to government with a four-seat majority under Wilson in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 election]] but increased its majority to 96 in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1966|1966 election]].

[[Image:Dodwilson.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Harold Wilson]]: Labour Prime Minister, 1964–1970 and 1974-1976]]
Wilson's government was responsible for a number of sweeping social and educational reforms such as the legalisation of abortion and homosexuality (initially only for men aged 21 or over) and a significant expansion of the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref&gt;Socialists in the Recession: The Search for Solidarity by Giles Radice and Lisanne Radice&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[comprehensive education]] was expanded and the [[Open University]] was created. As noted by one historian, in summing up the reform record of Wilson's government, &quot;In spite of the economic problems encountered by the First Wilson Government and in spite of (and to some degree in response to) the criticisms of its own supporters, Labour presided over a notable expansion of state welfare during its time in office.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FirstCentury&quot;/&gt;

Wilson's government had inherited a large trade deficit that led to a currency crisis and an ultimately doomed attempt to stave off devaluation of the pound. Labour went on to lose the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970 election]] to the Conservatives under [[Edward Heath]].

===In opposition (1970-1974)===
After losing the 1970 general election, Labour returned to opposition, but retained Harold Wilson as Leader. Heath's government soon ran into trouble over [[Northern Ireland]] and a dispute with miners in 1973 which led to the &quot;[[three-day week]]&quot;. The 1970s were a difficult time to be in government for both the Conservatives and Labour due to the [[1973 oil crisis]] which caused high inflation and a global recession. The Labour Party was returned to power again under Wilson a few weeks after the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]], forming a minority government with the support of the [[Ulster Unionist]]s. The Conservatives were unable to form a government as they had fewer seats despite receiving more votes numerically. It was the first general election since 1924 in which both main parties had received less than 40% of the popular vote and the first of six successive general elections in which Labour failed to reach 40% of the popular vote. In a bid to gain a proper majority, a second election was soon called for [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974]] in which Labour, still with Harold Wilson as leader, managed a majority of three, gaining just 18 seats and taking its total to 319.

===Return to government (1974-1979)===
[[Image:James Callaghan.JPG|thumb|upright|[[James Callaghan]]: Labour Prime Minister, 1976-1979]]
For much of its time in office the Labour government struggled with serious economic problems and a precarious majority in the Commons, while the party's internal dissent over Britain's membership of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), which Britain had entered under Edward Heath in 1972, led in 1975 to a [[United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum, 1975|national referendum]] on the issue in which two thirds of the public supported continued membership.

Harold Wilson's personal popularity remained reasonably high but he unexpectedly resigned as Prime Minister in 1976, citing health reasons and was replaced by James Callaghan. The Wilson and Callaghan governments of the 1970s tried to control inflation (which reached 23.7% in 1975&lt;ref name=&quot;SeldonHickson2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony Seldon|author2=Kevin Hickson|title=New Labour, old Labour: the Wilson and Callaghan governments, 1974-79|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Gmy8wS1bBZwC&amp;pg=PA64|accessdate=29 October 2010|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415312813|pages=64–}}&lt;/ref&gt;) by a policy of wage restraint. This was fairly successful, reducing inflation to 7.4% by 1978,&lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SeldonHickson2004&quot;/&gt; but led to increasingly strained relations between the government and the trade unions. The Labour governments of the 1970s did, however, manage to protect many people from the economic storm, with pensions increasing by 20% in real terms between 1974 and 1979, while measures such as rent controls and food and transport subsidies prevented the incomes of other people from deteriorating further.&lt;ref&gt;The Labour Party: An introduction to its history, structure and politics edited by Chris Cook and Ian Taylor&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislation was introduced which guaranteed annual uprating of benefits in line with increases in prices or average earnings, whichever was the highest. In addition, new benefits for the disabled and infirm were introduced whilst pensioners benefited from the largest ever increase in pensions up until that period. New employment legislation strengthened equal pay provisions, guaranteed payments for workers on short-time and temporarily laid-off and introduced job security and maternity leave for pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;The Labour Party since 1945 by Eric Shaw&lt;/ref&gt; Housing rehabilitation was encouraged via the establishment of Housing Action Areas and better improvement grants, whilst public sector housing completions rose 40,000 from the 111,500 achieved in 1974, before falling to barely 95,000 by 1979. In addition, furnished tenants were finally provided with security of tenure.&lt;ref&gt;The Five Giants: A Biography of the Welfare State by Nicholas Timmins&lt;/ref&gt;

A more effective system of workplace inspection was set up, together with the Health and Safety Executive, in response to the plight of many workers who suffered accidents or ill-health as a result of poor working conditions (whose plight which had long been ignored by the media). Industrial tribunals also provided protection through compensation for unfair dismissal, while the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service performed an effective function in the management of industrial disputes.&lt;ref&gt;ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Wilson and Callaghan governments were accused by many socialists of failing to put the Labour Party's socialist ideals into practice, it did much to bring about a greater deal of social justice in British society, as characterised by a significant reduction in poverty during the course of the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jrf.org.uk/sites/files/jrf/2077.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jrf.org.uk/sites/files/jrf/2019-poverty-wealth-place.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and arguably played as much as a role as the Attlee Government in advancing the cause of [[social democracy]] and reducing social and economic inequalities in the [[United Kingdom]].

Fear of advances by the nationalist parties, particularly in Scotland, led to the suppression of a [[McCrone report|report from Scottish Office economist Gavin McCrone]] that suggested that an independent Scotland would be 'chronically in surplus'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snpyouth.org/ysi/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=24 |title=Young Scots For Independence - Revealed: True oil wealth hidden to stop independence |publisher=SNP Youth|date=12 September 2005 |accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1977 by-election losses and defections to the breakaway [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party]] left Callaghan heading a minority government, forced to trade with smaller parties in order to govern. An arrangement negotiated in 1977 with Liberal leader [[David Steel]], known as the [[Lib-Lab Pact]], ended after one year. After this deals were forged with various small parties including the [[Scottish National Party]] and the Welsh nationalist [[Plaid Cymru]], prolonging the life of the government slightly.

The nationalist parties, in turn, demanded [[devolution]] to their respective constituent countries in return for their supporting the government. When referenda for Scottish and Welsh devolution were held in March 1979 [[Welsh devolution referendum, 1979|Welsh devolution]] was rejected outright while the [[Scottish devolution referendum, 1979|Scottish referendum]] returned a narrow majority in favour without reaching the required threshold of 40% support. When the Labour government duly refused to push ahead with setting up the proposed Scottish Assembly, the SNP withdrew its support for the government: this finally brought the government down as it triggered a vote of confidence in Callaghan's government that was lost by a single vote on 28 March 1979, necessitating a general election.

Callaghan had been widely expected to call a general election in the autumn of 1978 when most opinion polls showed Labour to have a narrow lead.&lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;/&gt; However he decided to extend his wage restraint policy for another year hoping that the economy would be in a better shape for a 1979 election. But during the winter of 1978-79 there were widespread strikes among lorry drivers, railway workers, car workers and local government and hospital workers in favour of higher pay-rises that caused significant disruption to everyday life. These events came to be dubbed the &quot;[[Winter of Discontent]]&quot;.

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 election]] Labour suffered electoral defeat by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], now led by [[Margaret Thatcher]]. The number of people voting Labour hardly changed between February 1974 and 1979 but in 1979 the Conservative Party achieved big increases in support in the Midlands and South of England, benefiting from both a surge in turnout and votes lost by the ailing Liberals.

===The &quot;Wilderness Years&quot; (1979–1997)===
After its defeat in the 1979 election the Labour Party underwent a period of internal rivalry between the left-wing, represented by [[Michael Foot]] and [[Tony Benn]], and the right-wing represented by [[Denis Healey]]. The election of Michael Foot as leader in 1980 saw the party shift to the left, and in 1981 four former cabinet ministers from the right of the Labour Party ([[Shirley Williams]], [[William Rodgers]], [[Roy Jenkins]] and [[David Owen]]) broke away to form the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialdemocraticparty.co.uk/history.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Labour Party was defeated heavily in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]], winning only 27.6% of the vote, its lowest share since [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|1918]], and receiving only half a million votes more than the [[SDP-Liberal Alliance]] who leader Michael Foot condemned for &quot;siphoning&quot; Labour support and enabling the Conservatives to win more seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/9/newsid_2500000/2500847.stm |title=1983: Thatcher wins landslide victory |publisher=BBC News |date=9 June 1983 |accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kinnock, Neil.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Neil Kinnock, leader of the party in opposition.]]

Michael Foot resigned and was replaced as leader by [[Neil Kinnock]] who was elected on 2 October 1983 and progressively moved the party towards the centre. Labour improved its performance in [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987]], gaining 20 seats and so reducing the Conservative majority from 143 to 102. They were now firmly established as the second political party in Britain as the Alliance had once again failed to make a breakthrough with seats and it subsequently collapsed, prompting a merger of the SDP and Liberals to form the [[Liberal Democrats]].

The Seventies and Eighties were significant for Labour in the rise of left-wing Labour councils (derided by the political right as the “loony left,” which emphasised participation and rights for women and minorities,  workers’ control, decentralisation, and opposition to neoliberalism. The left regarded local councils as part of an extra-parliamentary mode of opposition, alongside community groups and town halls. David Blunkett, once a member of labour’s left-wing, described Labour town halls as “a rudimentary opposition movement against the ruling party in Westminster.” The left councils greatly advanced the cause of blacks, women, and homosexuals within the political system, while also opening up council-decision making.

The Greater London Council, under the leadership of Ken Livingstone from 1981 to 1986, carried out a number of progressive policies such as a programme of grants to voluntary groups (which cost £47 million in 1984-85: £100 million in 1999 prices) and a “Fares Fair” policy, which cut London Transport fares by 25%. Although this policy was controversially ruled out by a House of Lords judgement, it was replaced by a more subtle cheap fares policy before London Transport was removed from GLC control by the government in 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;

In 1983, The Liverpool Labour party (then under the effective control of the [[Trotskyist]] [[Militant Tendency]] group) embarked upon an ambitious programme of municipal reform. Apart from  promoting propaganda for class conflict, as characterised by continual protests and “days of action” in which council workers and even school pupils were encouraged to participate, the Militant Labour council devoted much time and effort to improving the quality of the inner-city environment. New houses were constructed, while new parks, sports centres,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; and other leisure facilities were created. In addition, within a short space of time, 8,000 housing units were refurbished and 4,000 units had been built.&lt;ref&gt;Cities in the International Marketplace: The Political Economy of Urban Development in North America and Western Europe by H.V. Savitch and Paul Kantor&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, the results were an improvement on previous councils run by all parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;

Following the 1987 election, Kinnock began expelling [[Militant Tendency]] members from the party. They would later form the [[Socialist Party of England and Wales]] and the [[Scottish Socialist Party]] although a remnant of Militant continues to operate within the Labour Party through the newspaper ''[[Socialist Appeal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialist.net/britain-nightmare-downing-street120503.htm Britain: Nightmare on Downing Street - Time to reclaim the Labour Party] Socialist Appeal, 12 May 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

During the course of the 1980s, the GLC and several other Labour councils attempted to promote local economic recovery by setting up a network of enterprise boards and agencies. In addition, the GLC, Glasgow, Liverpool, Sheffield, and smaller London councils like Lambeth, Camden, and Islington adopted policies that challenged the Thatcher Government’s insistence on budgetary cuts and privatisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;To Build A New Jerusalem&quot;/&gt;

The Labour councils in old metropolitan counties of West Midlands, South Yorkshire, Greater London, and Greater Manchester led the way in developing interventionist economic policies. In the met county areas, Inward Investment Agencies, Enterprise Boards, Low Pay Units, and Co-operative Development Agencies proliferated, while parts of the country such as Salford Quays and Cardiff Bay were redeveloped. The Labour council in Birmingham in the 1980s worked to diversify the business visitor economy, as characterised by the decision to build a new, purpose-built convention centre in a decaying, inner-city district around Broad Street. By the mid-1990s, the success of this strategy was evident by the success of the International convention centre leading to wider redevelopment, as characterised by the building of a Sea Life Centre, the National Indoor Arena, bars, hotels, and thousands of newly constructed and refurbished flats and houses. This helped to revitalise the city centre and brought in people and money to both and the city and the West Midlands region as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;localleadership.gov.uk&quot;/&gt;

During the Eighties and Nineties, Labour councils vied to attract inward investment and build themselves up as tourist and retail centres. The relatively left-wing Labour council in Southampton was popular among property developers for its ambitious city centre plans, while the labour council in Sheffield set up a partnership with business to redevelop a large part of Sheffield that had been abandoned by steel closures. Some labour councils also remedied the neglect of management and service delivery during the mid-Eighties under the Thatcher Government and introduced charters and guaranteed standards of service for local residents before a similar “Citizen’s Charter” was launched by the Major Government.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;

In November 1990, Margaret Thatcher resigned as prime minister and was succeeded by [[John Major]]. Most opinion polls had shown Labour comfortably ahead of the Tories for more than a year before Mrs Thatcher's resignation, with the fall in Tory support blamed largely on the introduction of the unpopular [[poll tax]], combined with the fact that the economy was [[Early 1990s recession|sliding into recession]] at the time. One of the reasons Mrs Thatcher gave for her resignation was that she felt the Tories would stand a better chance of re-election with a new leader at the helm.
[[File:Old Logo Labour Party.svg|thumb|upright|left|Labour Party logo under Kinnock, Smith and Blair's leaderships]]

The change of leader in the Tory government saw a turnaround in support for the Tories, who regularly topped the opinion polls throughout 1991 although Labour regained the lead more than once.

The &quot;yo yo&quot; in the opinion polls continued into 1992, though after November 1990 any Labour lead in the polls was rarely sufficient for a majority. Major resisted Kinnock's calls for a general election throughout 1991. Kinnock campaigned on the theme &quot;It's Time for a Change&quot;, urging voters to elect a new government after more than a decade of unbroken Conservative rule. However, the Conservatives themselves had undergone a dramatic change in the change of leader from Margaret Thatcher to [[John Major]], at least in terms of style if not substance, whereas Kinnock was now the longest serving leader of any of the major political parties at the time and was now the longest-serving opposition leader in British political history.

From the outset, it was clearly a well-received change, as Labour's 14-point lead in the November 1990 &quot;Poll of Polls&quot; was replaced by an 8% Tory lead a month later.

The election on 9 April 1992 was widely tipped to result in a hung parliament or a narrow Labour majority, but in the event the Conservatives were returned to power, though with a much reduced majority of 21 in [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/election4/past_elections/4393317.stm 1992: Tories win again against odds] BBC News, 5 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the increased number of seats and votes, it was still an incredibly disappointing result for members and supporters of the Labour party, and for the first time in over 30 years there was serious doubt among the public and the media as to whether Labour could ever return to government.

Even before the country went to the polls, it seemed doubtful as to whether Labour could form a majority as an 8% electoral swing was needed across the country for this to be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/background/pastelec/ge92lab.shtml |title=BBC Politics 97 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;When Labour lost the election, there was widespread public and media debate as to whether the party could ever return to government, as had happened in 1959, not least due to the fact that it had failed to beat an incumbent Conservative government during a time of recession and high unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/in_depth/election_battles/1992_over.stm | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinnock then resigned as leader and was replaced by [[John Smith (UK politician)|John Smith]], who tragically died from a heart attack in May 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393323.stm | work=BBC News | title=1997: Labour landslide ends Tory rule | date=15 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Black Wednesday]] economic disaster in September 1992 left the Conservative government's reputation for monetary excellence in tatters, and by the end of that year Labour had a comfortable lead over the Tories in the opinion polls. Although the recession was declared over in April 1993 and a period of strong and sustained economic growth followed, coupled with a relatively swift fall in unemployment, the Labour lead in the opinion polls remained strong. 

The growing strength of the Labour Party during the Nineties was demonstrated by its success in preventing the passage of two major policy initiatives of the Major Government. Plans to privatise the post office were abandoned as a result of pressure from Labour, the [[Communication Workers Union (UK)|Communications Workers Union]] and voters in conservative rural heartlands who sought to protect post office services. Another major policy abandonment came as a result of [[Norman Lamont]]’s 1993 announcement that VAT on  domestic fuel and lighting would be introduced, starting at a rate of 8% in April 1994 and reaching the full rate the following April. The Labour Party launched a massive public campaign against the controversial tax, collecting 1.5 million signatures on a petition. An important House of Commons vote on introducing the second stage of the tax took place in December 1994. Concerted pressure was put on Conservative backbenchers from marginal seats to vote against the controversial tax, and in the end the Major Government was narrowly defeated, with 319 voting against the tax compared to 311 for. This not only represented a victory for the Labour party’s campaign, but it further demonstrated Labour’s social-democratic credentials and its growing political strength.&lt;ref&gt;The People’s Party: the History of the Labour Party by Tony Wright and Matt Carter&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period party membership increased dramatically, rising from 305,000 in 1994 to a high point of 405,000 in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall&quot;&gt;

Tony Blair continued to move the party further to the centre, abandoning the largely symbolic [[Clause IV|Clause Four]] at the 1995 mini-conference in a strategy to increase the party's appeal to &quot;[[middle England]]&quot;. More than a simple re-branding, however, the project would draw upon a new political [[third way (centrism)|third way]], particularly informed by the thought of the British sociologist [[Anthony Giddens]].

&quot;New Labour&quot; was first termed as an alternative branding for the Labour Party, dating from a conference slogan first used by the Labour Party in 1994, which was later seen in a draft manifesto published by the party in 1996, called ''[[New Labour, New Life For Britain]]''. It was a continuation of the trend that had begun under the leadership of [[Neil Kinnock]]. &quot;New Labour&quot; as a name has no official status, but remains in common use to distinguish modernisers from those holding to more traditional positions, normally referred to as &quot;Old Labour&quot;.

:'New Labour is a party of ideas and ideals but not of outdated ideology. What counts is what works. The objectives are radical. The means will be modern.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml|title=new Labour because Britain deserves better|publisher=Labour-Party.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Labour Party won the 1997 general election with a landslide majority of 179; it was the largest Labour majority ever, and the largest swing to a political party achieved since [[UK general election, 1945|1945]]. Over the next decade, a wide range of progressive social reforms were enacted,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paultruswell.org.uk/files/300%20Gains.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; with millions lifted out of poverty during Labour's time in office largely as a result of various tax and benefit reforms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/tackling-poverty.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.poverty.org.uk/01/index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/54/46/45649480.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the early acts of Tony Blair's government were the establishment of the [[national minimum wage]], the [[devolution]] of power to Scotland, Wales and [[Northern Ireland]], and the re-creation of a city-wide government body for London, the [[Greater London Authority]], with its own elected-[[Mayor of London|Mayor]]. Combined with a Conservative opposition that had yet to organise effectively under [[William Hague]], and the continuing popularity of Blair, Labour went on to win the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 election]] with a similar majority, dubbed the &quot;quiet landslide&quot; by the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/christmas/6873367/QI-Our-Quite-Interesting-Quiz-of-the-Decade-compiled-by-the-elves-from-the-TV-show.html|title=QI: Our Quite Interesting Quiz of the Decade, compiled by the elves from the TV show|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=26 December 2009|accessdate=14 May 2010| first1=John | last1=Mitchinson | first2=Justin | last2=Pollard | first3=Molly | last3=Oldfield | first4=Andy | last4=Murray | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A perceived turning point was when Tony Blair controversially allied himself with US President [[George W. Bush]] in supporting the [[Iraq War]], which caused him to lose much of his political support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,745536,00.html |title=European Opposition To Iraq War Grows &amp;#124; Current Affairs |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=13 January 2003 |accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kofi Annan|UN Secretary-General]], among many, considered the war illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3661134 BBC News]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iraq War was deeply unpopular in most western countries, with Western governments divided in their support&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bennhold |first=Katrin |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/08/28/sochi_ed3_.php |title=Unlikely alliance built on opposition to Iraq war now raises questions - NYTimes.com |work=International Herald Tribune |date=28 August 2004 |accessdate=13 April 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and under pressure from [[Protests against the Iraq War|worldwide popular protests]]. At the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 election]], Labour was re-elected for a third term, but with a reduced majority of 66. The decisions that led up to the Iraq war and its subsequent conduct are currently the subject of [[Sir John Chilcot|Sir John Chilcot's]] [[The Iraq Inquiry|Iraq Inquiry]].

Tony Blair announced in September 2006 that he would quit as leader within the year, though he had been under pressure to quit earlier than May 2007 in order to get a new leader in place before the May elections which were expected to be disastrous for Labour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5322094.stm I will quit within a year - Blair] BBC News, 7 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, the party did lose power in Scotland to a minority [[Scottish National Party]] government at the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|2007 elections]] and, shortly after this, Tony Blair resigned as Prime Minister and was replaced by his [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]], Gordon Brown. Although the party experienced a brief rise in the polls after this, its popularity soon slumped to its lowest level since the days of [[Michael Foot]]. During May 2008, Labour suffered heavy defeats in the [[London mayoral election, 2008|London mayoral election]], [[United Kingdom local elections, 2008|local elections]] and the loss in the [[Crewe and Nantwich by-election, 2008|Crewe and Nantwich by-election]], culminating in the party registering its worst ever opinion poll result since records began in 1943, of 23%, with many citing Brown's leadership as a key factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeremy |last=Lovell |authorlink= |author=|coauthors= |title=Brown hit by worst party rating |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/wtMostRead/idUKL2944559620080530 |publisher=Reuters |date=30 May 2008|accessdate=28 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Membership of the party also reached a low ebb, falling to 156,205 by the end of 2009: over 40 per cent of the 405,000 peak reached in 1997 and thought to be the lowest total since the party was founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/2475301/Labour-membership-falls-to-historic-low.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first1=James | last1=Kirkup | first2=Rosa | last2=Prince | title=Labour Party membership falls to lowest level since it was founded in 1900 | date=30 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vote-2007.co.uk/index.php?action=printpage;topic=4767.0&lt;/ref&gt;

Finance proved a major problem for the Labour Party during this period; a &quot;[[cash for peerages]]&quot; scandal under Tony Blair resulted in the drying up of many major sources of donations. Declining party membership, partially due to the reduction of activists' influence upon policy-making under the reforms of Neil Kinnock and Tony Blair, also contributed to financial problems. Between January and March 2008, the Labour Party received just over £3&amp;nbsp;million in donations and were £17&amp;nbsp;million in debt; compared to the Conservatives' £6&amp;nbsp;million in donations and £12&amp;nbsp;million in debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/news-and-media/news-releases/electoral-commission-media-centre/news-releases-donations/new-figures-published-showing-political-partiesrsquo-donations-and-borrowing|title=New figures published showing political parties’ donations and borrowing|date=22 May 2008|publisher=[[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|The Electoral Commission]]|accessdate=2 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]] on 6 May that year, Labour with 29.0% of the vote won the second largest number of seats (258). The Conservatives with 36.5% of the vote won the largest number of seats (307), but [[hung parliament|no party had an overall majority]], meaning that Labour could still remain in power if they managed to form a coalition with at least one smaller party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/may/07/uk-election-results-data-candidates-seats UK election results: data for every candidate in every seat] The Guardian, 7 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Labour Party would have had to form a coalition with more than one other smaller party to gain an overall majority; anything less would result in a minority government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/wintour-and-watt/2010/may/07/gordon-brown-rainbow-coalition |title=General election 2010: Can Gordon Brown put together a rainbow coalition? |date=2010-05-07 |work = The Guardian |location=London |first=Patrick |last=Wintour}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 May 2010, after talks to form a coalition with the [[Liberal Democrats]] broke down, Gordon Brown announced his intention to stand down as Leader before the [[Labour Party Conference]] but a day later resigned as both [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] and party leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/gordon-brown-to-resign-as-labour-leader-1970273.html|title=Gordon Brown to resign as Labour leader|date=10 May 2010|work=The Independent|accessdate= | location=London | first1=Trevor | last1=Mason | first2=Jon | last2=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In opposition (2010–present)===
[[Harriet Harman]] became the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] and acting Leader of the Labour Party following the resignation of Gordon Brown on 11 May 2010, pending a [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2010|leadership election]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8676333.stm | work=BBC News | title=Harman made acting Labour leader | date=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently won by Ed Miliband. This period has to date witnessed a revival in Labour's opinion poll fortunes, with the first Labour lead recorded since the commencement of Gordon Brown's premiership in 2007 being reported in a [[YouGov]] poll for [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] on 27 September 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=YouGov/Sun &amp;#8211; 39/40/12 27 Sep 2010 |url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/2814 |title=UK Polling Report |publisher=UK Polling Report |date=2010-09-27 |accessdate=2011-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Labour Party Conference|2010 Labour Party Conference]].

The '''Leader of the Labour Party''' is the most senior politician within the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Since 25 September 2010, the office has been held by [[Ed Miliband]], following the resignation of former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]].

[[Harriet Harman]] is currently the [[Deputy Leader of the Labour Party]]
==Background==
The post of Leader of the Labour Party was officially created in 1922. Before this time, between when Labour MPs were first elected in [[UK general election, 1906|1906]] and the election in [[UK general election, 1922|1922]], when substantial gains were made, the post was known as '''[[Parliamentary Labour Party|Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party]]'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;&gt; Thorpe, Andrew. (2001) ''A History Of The British Labour Party'', Palgrave, ISBN 0-333-92908-x&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other British political party leaders, the Labour Leader does not have the power to dismiss or appoint their Deputy. Both the Leader and Deputy Leader are elected by an [[Alternative Vote]] system in an electoral college, with a third of the votes allocated to the Party's [[List of Labour Party (UK) MPs|MPs]] and [[List of members of the European Parliament 2009–2014|MEPs]], a third to individual members of the Labour Party, and a third to individual members of all affiliated organisations, including [[Socialist society (Labour Party)|socialist societies]] and [[Affiliated trade union|trade unions]].

When the Labour Party is in [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition|Opposition]], as it currently is, the Leader of the Labour Party usually acts as the [[Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition|Leader of the Opposition]], and chairs the [[Shadow Cabinet (UK)|Shadow Cabinet]]. Concordantly, when the Party is in [[Her Majesty's Government|Government]], the Leader would usually become the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], [[First Lord of the Treasury]] and [[Minister for the Civil Service]], as well as appointing the [[Cabinet (UK)|Cabinet]].

In 1921, [[John Robert Clynes]] became the first Leader of the Labour Party to be born in [[England]]; prior to this, all Leaders had been born in [[Scotland]]. In [[UK general election, 1924|1924]], [[Ramsay MacDonald]] became the first ever [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], leading a minority administration. [[Clement Attlee]] would become the first Leader to lead a majority government in [[UK general election, 1945|1945]]. The first to be born in [[Wales]] was [[Neil Kinnock]], who was elected in [[UK general election, 1983|1983]]. The most electorally successful Labour Leader to date is [[Tony Blair]], who won three in [[UK general election, 1997|1997]], [[UK general election, 2001|2001]], both [[landslide victories]], and [[UK general election, 2005|2005]].

&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; Although these were technically Leaders of the Labour Party, they only assumed this role temporarily because of the death or resignation of the incumbent. In the case of [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]] and [[Margaret Beckett]], both were serving as Deputy Leader, and assumed the role temporarily following the sudden deaths of [[Hugh Gaitskell]] and [[John Smith (UK politician)|John Smith]] respectfully. [[Harriet Harman]] was Deputy Leader when [[Gordon Brown]] resigned, becoming Leader while the process of electing a new Leader was ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.savethelabourparty.org/labourpartyrulebook2008.pdf|title=Labour Party Rule Book 2008|publisher=The Labour Party|quote=&quot;When the party is in opposition and the party leader, for whatever reason, becomes permanently unavailable, the deputy leader shall automatically become party leader on a pro-tem basis.&quot;|accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==
It is not uncommon for a retired Leader of the Labour Party to be granted a [[peerage]] upon their retirement, particularly if they served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]; examples of this include [[Clement Attlee]] and [[Harold Wilson]]. However, [[Neil Kinnock]] was also elevated to the [[House of Lords]], despite never being Prime Minister, and [[Michael Foot]] declined a similar offer.

There are currently five living former Leaders of the Labour Party (with the period they were in office):
* [[Baron#Style of address|The Rt Hon]]&lt;/small&gt; [[Neil Kinnock|The Lord Kinnock]] (1983–1992)
* [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council#Rights and privileges of members|The Rt Hon]] [[Margaret Beckett]] &lt;small&gt;[[Member of Parliament|MP]]&lt;/small&gt; (1994)
* [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council#Rights and privileges of members|The Rt Hon]] [[Tony Blair]]&lt;!-- No 'PC' for Privy Council here as Tony Blair is not a peer --&gt; (1994–2007)
* [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council#Rights and privileges of members|The Rt Hon]] [[Gordon Brown]] &lt;small&gt;[[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]]&lt;/small&gt; (2007–2010)

{{PoliticsUK}}
The '''Leader of Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition in the United Kingdom''' (more commonly known as the '''Leader of the Opposition''') is the politician who leads the Official Opposition ([[Official Opposition (United Kingdom)|Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition]]) in the United Kingdom. There is also a '''Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords'''. At one time the leaders in the two Houses were of equal status, unless one was the most recent Prime Minister from the party forming the official opposition. However since early in the twentieth century there has been little dispute that the leader in the House of Commons was pre-eminent. 

The Leader of the Opposition is normally the leader of the largest party not within the government, which is usually the second largest political party in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. He or she is normally viewed as an alternative [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], and is a member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]].

The Leader of the Opposition is entitled to a salary in addition to their salary as Member of Parliament. In 2010, this additional entitlement was available up to a  maximum of £73,617.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/m06.pdf|title=parliament.uk|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Leader of the Opposition is [[Ed Miliband]], leader of the [[UK Labour Party|Labour Party]].

== Leaders of the Opposition from 1807 ==
=== Early developments 1807–1830 ===

For there to be a recognised Leader of the Opposition, it was necessary for there to be a sufficiently cohesive opposition to need a formal leader.&lt;ref&gt;The following discussion of the position up to 1830 and the emergence of the office of Leader of the Opposition, is based upon ''His Majesty's Opposition 1714–1830'', by Archibald S. Foord.&lt;/ref&gt; The first time this situation developed was in the Parliament of 1807–1812, when the members of the Grenvillite and Foxite Whig factions decided to formalise a joint leadership for the whole Whig Party. 

The [[Ministry of all the Talents]], in which both Whig factions participated, fell before the [[United Kingdom general election, 1807]]. The Whigs then re-adopted the traditional type of factional leadership, of ''an'' opposition rather than ''the'' opposition. The Prime Minister of the Talents ministry, [[William Wyndham Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville|Lord Grenville]], led his faction from the House of Lords. The former government Leader of the House of Commons, [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Viscount Howick]] (the political heir of [[Charles James Fox]] who had died in 1806), led his faction from the House of Commons.

Howick's father, [[Charles Grey, 1st Earl Grey|the 1st Earl Grey]] died on 14 November 1807. The new Earl Grey automatically vacated his seat in the House of Commons and moved to the House of Lords. This left no obvious Whig leader in the House of Commons. 

Grenville's article in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' confirms that he was  considered the Whig leader in the House of Lords between 1807 and 1817, despite Grey leading the larger faction.

Grenville and Grey, whom Foord described as being &quot;the [[duumvirate|duumvirs]] of the party from 1807 to 1817&quot;, consulted about what was to be done. Grenville was at first reluctant to name a Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons, commenting &quot;... all the elections in the world would not have made Windham or Sheridan leaders of the old Opposition while Fox was alive ...&quot;.

In the end Grenville and Grey made a joint recommendation to the Whig MPs of [[George Ponsonby]], who was accepted as the first Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons. Ponsonby, an Irish lawyer who was the uncle of Grey's wife, had been [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]] during the Ministry of all the Talents and had only just been re-elected to the House of Commons in 1808 when he became leader.  

Ponsonby was a weak leader, but as he could not be persuaded to resign and the duumvirs did not want to depose him, he remained in place until he died in 1817. 

Lord Grenville retired from active politics in 1817, leaving Grey as the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords. Grey was not a former Prime Minister in 1817, unlike Grenville, so under the convention that developed later in the century he would have been in theory of equal status to whoever was leader in the other House. However there was little doubt that if a Whig ministry was to be formed, Grey rather than the less distinguished Commons leaders would have been invited to form that government. In this respect Grey's position was like that of the Earl of Derby in the Protectionist Conservative opposition of the late 1840s and early 1850s.

There was a delay of about a year, until 1818, before a new Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons was chosen. This was [[George Tierney]]. He was reluctant to accept the leadership and had weak support from his party. On 18 May 1819, Tierney moved a motion in the House of Commons for a committee on the state of the nation. This motion was defeated by 357 to 178, which was a division involving the largest number of MPs until the debates over the Reform bill in the early 1830s. Foord comments that &quot;this defeat put an effective end to Tierney's leadership ... Tierney did not disclaim the leadership till 23 Jan. 1821 ..., but he had ceased to exercise its functions since the great defeat&quot;.

Between 1821 and 1830 the Whig Commons leadership was left vacant. The leadership in the House of Lords was not much more effective. In 1824 Grey retired from active leadership, asking the party to follow the [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Marquess of Lansdowne]] &quot;as the person whom his friends were to look upon as their leader&quot;. Lansdowne disclaimed the title of leader, although in practice he performed the function.

Following the retirement of [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] from the Prime Ministership in 1827, the party political situation changed. The principal opposition between April 1827 and January 1828 followed the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] and [[Robert Peel]], although Earl Grey and a section of the Whigs were also in opposition to the coalition government. 

Neither Peel nor Wellington agreed to serve under [[George Canning]] and they were followed by five other members of the former Cabinet as well as forty junior members of the previous government. The Tory Party was heavily split between the &quot;High Tories&quot; (or &quot;Ultras&quot;, nicknamed after [[Ultra-royalist|the contemporary party]] in France) and the moderates supporting Canning, often called '[[Canningites]]'. As a result Canning found it difficult to form a government and chose to invite a number of Whigs to join his Cabinet, including [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]]. After Canning's death, [[Frederick Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich|Lord Goderich]] continued the coalition for a few more months.

The Duke of Wellington formed a ministry in January 1828 and after it adopted a policy of [[Catholic Emancipation]], the opposition was composed of Whigs, Canningites and some ultra-Tories. Lord Lansdowne, in the absence of any alternative, remained the leading figure in the Whig opposition.

In 1830 Grey returned to the front rank of politics. On 30 June 1830 he denounced the government in the House of Lords. He rapidly attracted the support of opponents of the ministry. The renewal of organised opposition was also marked earlier in the year by the election of a new Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons, the heir of Earl Spencer, [[John Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer|Viscount Althorp]]. In November 1830 Grey was invited to form a government and resumed the formal leadership of the party.

Wellington and Peel again became the Leaders of the Opposition in the two Houses, from November 1830.

In the period of 1830–1937 the normal expectation was that there would be two leading parties (often with smaller allied groups), of which one would form the government and the other the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;The discussion in this section is based upon ''British Historical Facts 1830–1900'' and ''Twentieth Century British Political Facts 1900–2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Both these parties were expected to have recognised leaders in the two Houses, so there was normally no problem in identifying who was the Leader of the Opposition in each House. 

The constitutional convention developed in the nineteenth century was that if one of the leaders was the last Prime Minister of the party, then he would be considered the overall leader of his party. If that was not the case then the leaders of both Houses were of equal status. As the monarch retained some discretion as to which leader should be invited to form a ministry, it was not always obvious in advance which one would be called upon to do so.

However as the Leadership of the Opposition only existed by custom, the normal expectations and conventions were modified by political realities from time to time.

From 1830 until 1846 the [[Tory Party|Tory]]/[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Party and the [[Whig Party (UK)|Whig Party]] (increasingly often described with its [[Radical Party (UK)|Radical]] and other allies as the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]) alternated in power and provided clear Leaders of the Opposition.

In 1846 the Conservative Party split into Protectionist Conservative and [[Peelite]] (or Liberal Conservative) factions. The Protectionists being the larger group, the recognised Leaders of the Opposition were drawn from their ranks. In the House of Lords, Lord Stanley (subsequently the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]]) was the Protectionist leader. He was the only established front rank political figure in the faction and thus a very strong candidate to form the next Conservative ministry. 

The leadership in the House of Commons was more problematic. [[Lord George Bentinck]], the leader of the Protectionist revolt against Sir Robert Peel, initially led the party in the Commons. He resigned in December 1847. The party was then faced with the problem of how to produce a credible leader, who was not [[Benjamin Disraeli]]. 

The first attempt to square the circle, was made in February 1848, when the young [[Charles Manners, 6th Duke of Rutland|Marquess of Granby]] was installed as the leader. He gave up the post in March 1848. The leadership then fell vacant until February 1849.

The next experiment was to entrust the leadership to a [[triumvirate]] of Granby, Disraeli and the elderly [[John Charles Herries]]. In practice Disraeli ignored his co-triumvirs. In 1851 Granby resigned and the party accepted Disraeli as the sole leader. The Protectionists by then were clearly the core of the Conservative Party and Derby was able to form his first government in 1852.

The Liberal Party was formally founded in 1859, replacing the Whig Party as one of the two leading parties. With increasing party discipline it became easier to define the principal opposition party and the Leaders of the Opposition.

The last overall Leader of the Opposition, in the House of Lords, was the [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Earl of Rosebery]]. He had been Liberal Prime Minister from 1894 to 1895 and served as Leader of the Opposition until he resigned in November 1896.

[[File:Andrew Bonar Law Vanity Fair 10 April 1912.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;&quot;the opposition&quot;&lt;center&gt;[[Bonar Law]] as caricatured in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]], April 1912&lt;/center&gt;]]
In 1915 the Liberal, Conservative and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] parties formed a coalition. The [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] did not join the government, but were not in opposition to it. As almost nobody in the Parliament could be said to be in opposition to the coalition, the Leaderships of the Opposition fell vacant.

[[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Sir Edward Carson]], the leading figure amongst the Irish Unionist part of the Conservative and Unionist Party, resigned from the coalition ministry on 19 October 1915. He then became the leader of those Unionists who were not members of the government, effectively Leader of the Opposition in the Commons. 

The situation changed in December 1916. A leading Liberal, [[David Lloyd George]], formed a coalition with the support of a section of the Liberals and the Conservative and Labour parties. The Liberal leader, [[Herbert Henry Asquith]] and most of his leading colleagues, left the government and took up seats on what was traditionally the opposition side of the House of Commons. Asquith was recognised as the Leader of the Opposition. He retained that post until he was defeated in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918]]. Although Asquith continued to be the leader of the Liberal Party, as he was not a member of the House of Commons he was not eligible to be Leader of the Opposition.

The Parliament elected in 1918, which sat from 1919 until 1922, represents the most significant deviation from the principle that the Leader of the Opposition is the leader of the party not in government with the greatest numerical support in the House of Commons. The largest opposition party (disregarding [[Sinn Féin]], whose MPs did not take their seats at Westminster), was the Labour Party which had left the continuing Lloyd George coalition and won 57 seats at the general election. Thirty six Liberals had been elected without coalition support, but not all of those were opponents of Lloyd George. The Labour Party did not have a leader before 1922. The Parliamentary Labour Party annually elected a Chairman, but the party  did not seriously assert a claim that the Chairman was the Leader of the Opposition. Although the issue of who was entitled to be Leader of the Opposition was never formally resolved, in practice the Opposition Liberal leader performed the Parliamentary functions associated with the office. 

The small group of Opposition Liberals met in 1919. They resolved that they were the Liberal Parliamentary Party. They elected [[Donald Maclean (British politician)|Sir Donald Maclean]] as Chairman of the Parliamentary Party. Liberal Party practice at the time, when the overall Leader of the Party was not a member of the House of Commons, was for the Chairman to function as the Leader in the House. Maclean therefore took on the role of Leader of the Opposition, until Asquith returned to the House after a by-election in 1920 and took over.

From 1922 the Labour Party had a recognised leader and took over from the Liberal Party the role of being one of the two largest parties, alternating in government and as the principal opposition party. From this point, all Leaders of the Opposition in the House of Commons were overall Leaders of the Opposition. There were three instances of peers being seriously considered for the Prime Ministership, during the twentieth century ([[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Curzon of Kedleston]] in 1923, [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Halifax]] in 1940 and [[Alec Douglas-Home|Home]] in 1963), but these were all cases where the Conservative Party was in government and do not affect the List of Leaders of the Opposition.

In 1931–32 the Leader of the Labour Party was [[Arthur Henderson]]. He was Leader of the Opposition for a short period in 1931, but was ineligible to continue when he lost his seat in the 1931 general election. [[George Lansbury]] was Leader of the Opposition before he also became the Leader of the Labour Party in 1932.

=== Statutory Leaders of the Opposition from 1937 ===
Leaders of the Opposition, in the two Houses of Parliament, had been generally recognised and given a special status in Parliament for more than a century before they were mentioned in legislation.

''[[Erskine May: Parliamentary Practice]]'' confirms that the office of Leader of the Opposition was first given statutory recognition in the Ministers of the Crown Act 1937. 

* Section 5 states that &quot;There shall be paid to the Leader of the Opposition an annual salary of two thousand pounds&quot;.

* Section 10(1) includes a definition (which codifies the usual situation under the previous custom) -&quot; &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; means that member of the House of Commons who is for the time being the leader in that House of the party in opposition to His Majesty's Government having the greatest numerical strength in that House&quot;.

* The 1937 Act also contains an important provision to decide who is the Leader of the Opposition, if this is in doubt. Under section 10(3) &quot;If any doubt arises as to which is or was at any material time the party in opposition to His Majesty's Government having the greatest numerical strength in the House of Commons, or as to who is or was at any material time the leader in that House of such a party the question shall be decided for the purposes of this Act by the Speaker of the House of Commons, and his decision, certified in writing under his hand, shall be final and conclusive&quot;.

Subsequent legislation also gave statutory recognition to the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords. 

* Section 2(1) of the Ministerial and other Salaries Act 1975, provides that &quot;In this Act &quot;Leader of the Opposition&quot; means, in relation to either House of Parliament, that member of that House who is for the time being the Leader in that House of the party in opposition to Her Majesty's Government having the greatest numerical strength in the House of Commons&quot;.

* Section 2(2) is in exactly the same terms as section 10(3) of the 1937 Act (apart from substituting Her Majesty's for His Majesty's).

* Section 2(3) is a corresponding provision for the [[Lord Chancellor]] (since 2005, the [[Lord Speaker]]) to decide about the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords.

The legislative provisions confirm that Leader of the Opposition is, strictly, a Parliamentary office; so that to be Leader a person must be a member of the House in which he or she leads. 

Since 1937, the Leader of the Opposition has received a state salary in addition to their salary as a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP), now equivalent to a Cabinet Minister. The holder also receives a chauffeur-driven car for official business of equivalent cost and specification to the vehicles used by most [[minister (government)|cabinet ministers]].

In 1940 the three largest parties in the House of Commons formed a coalition government to continue to prosecute the Second World War. This coalition continued in office until shortly after the defeat of Germany in 1945. As the former Leader of the Opposition had joined the government the issue arose of who was to hold the office or perform its functions. ''Keesing's Contemporary Archives 1937–1940'' (at paragraph 4069D) reported the situation, based on ''[[Hansard]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Prime Minister replying to Mr Denman in the House of Commons on 21 May, said that in view of the formation of an Administration embracing the three main political parties, H.M. Government was of the opinion that the provision of the Ministers of the Crown Act, 1937, relating to the payment of a salary to the Leader of the Opposition was in abeyance for the time being, as there was no alternative party capable of forming a Government. He added that he did not consider amending legislation necessary. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'' reported that the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]] met on 22 May 1940 and unanimously elected Dr H.B. Lees-Smith as Chairman of the PLP (an office normally held by the party leader at that time) and as spokesman of the Party from the opposition front bench. 

After the death of Lees-Smith, on 18 December 1941, the PLP held a meeting on 21 January 1942. F. Pethick-Lawrence was unanimously elected Chairman of the PLP and the official spokesman of the party in the House of Commons while the party leader was serving in the government. After the deputy leader of the party (Arthur Greenwood) left the government on 22 February 1942 he took over these roles from Pethick-Lawrence until the end of the coalition and the resumption of normal party politics.

==List of Leaders of the Opposition==
The table lists the people who were, or who acted as, Leaders of the Opposition in the two Houses of Parliament since 1807. 

The leaders of the two Houses were of equal status, before 1922, unless one was the most recent Prime Minister for the party. Such a former Prime Minister was considered to be the overall Leader of the Opposition. From 1922 the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons was considered to be the overall Leader of the Opposition. Overall leaders names are bolded. Acting leaders names are in italics, unless the acting leader subsequently became a full leader during a continuous period as leader.

Due to the fragmentation of both principal parties in 1827–30, the Leaders and principal opposition parties suggested for those years are provisional.

A &quot;+&quot; after the name indicates that the Leader died in office.

&lt;small&gt;Notes:-
* &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Formerly Prime Minister
* &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Subsequently Prime Minister
* &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Formerly and subsequently Prime Minister
* &lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; Foord suggests that Lansdowne was, in effect, acting Whig leader in 1824–27. This may possibly have also been the case in 1828–30. Grey's article in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' suggests &quot;... though he called on Lansdowne to take up the leadership of the opposition he was still unwilling to give it up altogether&quot;. Grey was in opposition in 1827–28, when Lansdowne was in government. Given the confusion of the politics of the period, particularly after 1827 when both principal parties were fragmented, it is possible that Grey should be considered Leader of the Opposition 1824–1830. However the definite statements (by Foord) that Grey resigned the leadership in 1824 and (by Cook &amp; Keith) that Grey did not resume the leadership until November 1830 leads to a different conclusion.
* &lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; An alternative interpretation is that Palmerston (the immediate past Prime Minister) and Lord John Russell (a previous Prime Minister) were joint leaders. Cook &amp; Keith have Palmerston as the sole leader.
* &lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; Harcourt resigned 14 December 1898.
* &lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt; Rosebery resigned 6 October 1896.
* &lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt; Balfour lost his seat in the House of Commons in January 1906.
* &lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt; During Asquith's coalition government of 1915–1916, there was no formal opposition in either the Commons or the Lords. The only party not in Asquith's Liberal, Conservative, Labour Coalition was the Irish Nationalist Party led by [[John Redmond]]. However, this party supported the government and did not function as an Opposition.
: [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Sir Edward Carson]], the leading figure amongst the Irish Unionist allies of the Conservative Party, resigned from the coalition ministry on 19 October 1915. He then became the de facto leader of those Unionists who were not members of the government, effectively Leader of the Opposition in the Commons.
* &lt;sup&gt;G&lt;/sup&gt; Asquith lost his seat in the House of Commons in December 1918.
* &lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt; Douglas in ''The History of the Liberal Party 1895–1970'' observes that &quot;The technical question whether the Leader of the Opposition was Maclean or [[William Adamson]], Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, was never fully resolved ... The fact that Adamson did not press his claim for Opposition leadership is of more than technical interest, for it shows that the Labour Party was still not taking itself seriously as a likely alternative government&quot;.
* &lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; The Labour Party did not appoint a Leader in the Lords, until it formed its first government in 1924.
* &lt;sup&gt;J&lt;/sup&gt; Henderson lost his seat in the House of Commons on 27 October 1931.
* &lt;sup&gt;K&lt;/sup&gt; Lansbury was acting as Leader, in the absence from the House of Commons of Henderson, in 1931–1932; before becoming party leader himself in 1932.
* &lt;sup&gt;L&lt;/sup&gt; Attlee was acting as Leader, after the resignation of Lansbury on 25 October 1935, before being elected party leader himself on 3 December 1935.
* &lt;sup&gt;M&lt;/sup&gt; During World War II a succession of Labour politicians acted as Leader of the Opposition for the purpose of allowing the House of Commons to function normally. However, because the Government 1940–45 was a coalition government in which Labour politicians functioned fully as members of the Government, from [[Deputy Prime Minister (UK)|Deputy Prime Minister]] Clement Attlee downwards, none of them received the salary for the post of Leader of the Opposition.

:The largest party that opposed the war and was not part of the coalition - and therefore, in theory, the opposition was the Independent Labour Party led by [[James Maxton]]. With only three MPs, it tried to take over the opposition frontbench but was widely opposed in this venture.
* &lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; Lord Addison was not a member of the wartime coalition government. When Labour was part of the government from May 1940 until May 1945, Addison presumably functioned as a technical Leader of the Opposition, in the same way as the acting Leaders of the Opposition in the House of Commons.
* &lt;sup&gt;O&lt;/sup&gt; Viscount Cranborne is the courtesy title of the heir to the Marquess of Salisbury. Two Lords Cranborne have been Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords. They sat in the House of Lords because of a [[writ of acceleration]] affecting one of the family Baronies.
* &lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt; Commonly the acting leader, following the death or immediate resignation of the leader, but according to the Labour Party constitution the actual leader until the next leader is selected. Before 1981 the leader, in opposition, was elected annually by the Parliamentary Labour Party. After 1981 the leader is elected by an electoral college at a party conference.&lt;/small&gt;

'''Margaret Mary Beckett''' (née '''Jackson'''; born 15 January 1943&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/court_and_social/article5518045.ece The Times] 15 January 2009. Retrieved 2010-07-24.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician who has been the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Derby South (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby South]] since [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983]], rising to become the [[Deputy Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Deputy Leader of the Labour Party]] under [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]], from 18 July 1992 to 12 May 1994, and briefly serving as Leader of the Party following Smith's death. She later served in the [[Blair Ministry|Cabinet]] under [[Tony Blair]], most notably being appointed [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] in 2006.

Beckett was first elected to Parliament in [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|1974]] and held junior positions in the governments of [[Harold Wilson]] and [[James Callaghan]]. She lost her seat in [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979]] but returned to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983]] and became a senior member of the Labour Party. She was elected Deputy Leader of the Labour Party in 1992 and was briefly its leader in 1994 following the premature death of [[John Smith (UK politician)|John Smith]], the first woman to occupy either role.

After Labour's victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], Beckett became a member of Tony Blair's [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]]. Initially the [[President of the Board of Trade]], she was later the [[Leader of the House of Commons]] and [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]]. In 2006, Blair appointed her [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], making her the first woman to hold the position, and&amp;mdash;after [[Margaret Thatcher]]&amp;mdash;the second woman to hold one of the [[Great Offices of State]].

After Blair resigned as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in 2007, Margaret Beckett was not reappointed to the Cabinet. After some time, Blair's successor [[Gordon Brown]] made her [[Minister of State for Housing and Planning]] in 2008. She left the government again on 5 June 2009. She is currently the longest serving female MP in the Commons. She was one of the longest serving ministers in government and is one of the few remaining MPs who served in the Labour governments of the 1970s.

==Early life==
Margaret Beckett was born Margaret Jackson in 1943, in [[Ashton-under-Lyne]], into a working-class family. She had two sisters, one a nun, the other a doctor and mother of 3. She was educated at the [[Notre Dame High School (Norwich)|Notre Dame High School for Girls]] in [[Norwich]] (a [[Roman Catholic]] [[direct grant grammar school]] which subsequently became a [[voluntary aided]] Catholic comprehensive in 1979), then at the [[University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology]], where she qualified as a [[metallurgy|metallurgist]]. She was an active member of the Student Union and served on its Council as Associate Member rep.

In 1961, Beckett joined [[Associated Electrical Industries]] as a student apprentice in metallurgy. She joined the [[Transport and General Workers Union]] in 1964 and remains a member to this day. She joined the [[University of Manchester]] in 1966 as an experiment officer in its metallurgy department. In 1970 Beckett went to work for the Labour Party as a researcher in industrial policy.

She married the chairman of her local Labour Party, Lionel &quot;Leo&quot; Beckett in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4977348.stm |title=Profile: Margaret Beckett |date=5 May 2006 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2009-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leo works as Beckett's agent and aide, travelling with her and working in her private office. He is paid from Margaret Beckett's staff allowance, one of the largest staff expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article629076.ece |publisher=The Times |date=8 November 2006 |title=Taxpayers foot the bill for globetrotting Mr Beckett |first=Sam |last=Coates |accessdate=2009-08-28 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leo has two sons from a previous marriage, and three grandchildren.

Beckett and her husband enjoy [[travel trailer|caravan]] holidays and have continued to do so throughout her political career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1524898/Follow-that-caravan---this-is-a-job-for-special-branch.html |publisher=The Telegraph |title=Follow that caravan - this is a job for special branch |date=27 July 2006 |accessdate=2009-08-28 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2007100413,00.html|title=Beckett told to give up caravan holidays | location=London | work=The Sun|first=David|last=Wooding|date=9 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Member of Parliament==
In 1973, she was selected as Labour candidate for [[Lincoln (UK Parliament constituency)|Lincoln]], which the party wanted to win back from dissident ex-Labour MP [[Dick Taverne]]. Beckett lost to Taverne at the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]] by 1,297 votes. After the election she went to work as a researcher for [[Judith Hart]], the [[Minister for Overseas Development]] at the Foreign Office. [[Harold Wilson]] called another general election in October 1974, and Beckett again went to fight Taverne at Lincoln in the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974 general election]]. This time Beckett was elected, by just 984 votes.

Almost immediately after her election she was appointed as Judith Hart's [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]]. Harold Wilson made her a [[Whip (politics)|Whip]] in 1975, and she was promoted in 1976 by [[James Callaghan]] to [[Parliamentary Under Secretary of State]] at the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department of Education and Science]], replacing [[Joan Lestor]], who had resigned in protest over spending cuts. She remained in that position until she lost her seat at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]]. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate [[Kenneth Carlisle]] narrowly won the seat with a 602 vote majority, the first time the Conservatives had won at Lincoln since [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|1935]].

She joined [[Granada Television]] as a researcher in 1979. Out of Parliament, and now Margaret Beckett, she was elected to Labour's [[National Executive Committee]] in 1980, and supported left-winger [[Tony Benn]] in the 1981 Labour deputy leadership election won by [[Denis Healey]]. She was the subject of a vociferous attack from [[Joan Lestor]] at the conference.

Beckett was chosen to fight the parliamentary seat of [[Derby South (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby South]] after the retirement of the sitting MP, [[Walter Johnson (UK politician)|Walter Johnson]]. At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]] she won the seat only very narrowly; the Labour majority was 421.

===Shadow Cabinet and Deputy Leader, 1984-94===
Returning to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], Margaret Beckett gradually moved away from the [[hard left]], supporting incumbent leader [[Neil Kinnock]] against Benn in 1988. By this time she was a front bencher, as a spokeswoman on Social Security since 1984, becoming a member of the [[Shadow Cabinet]] in 1989 as Shadow Chief Secretary to the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]]. After the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 general election]] she was elected [[Deputy Leader of the British Labour Party|Deputy Leader of the Labour Party]] and served under [[John Smith (UK politician)|John Smith]] as Shadow [[Leader of the House of Commons]]. She became a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Member of the Privy Council]] in 1993. She was the first woman to serve as deputy leader of the Labour Party.

Following the sudden death of [[John Smith (UK politician)|John Smith]] from a heart attack on 12 May 1994, Margaret Beckett became Labour leader, [[Labour Party Rule Book|the Party's constitution]] providing for the automatic succession of the deputy leader for the remainder of the leadership term, upon the death or resignation of an incumbent leader in opposition. Labour leaders are subject to annual re-election at the time of the annual party conference while the party is in opposition. Accordingly, Beckett was constitutionally entitled to remain in office as leader until the 1994 Conference, but the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) decided to bring forward the election for Leader and Deputy Leader to July 1994.

She came third in [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1994|the subsequent leadership election]], behind Tony Blair and [[John Prescott]]. The Deputy Leadership was contested at the same time; Beckett, standing in this election as well, was defeated, coming second behind Prescott. She was however kept in the shadow cabinet by Tony Blair as [[Shadow Secretary of State for Health|Shadow Health Secretary]].

===In government, 1997-2001===
Under Tony Blair's leadership, Margaret Beckett was the Shadow Secretary of State for [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Health]], and then from 1995 the shadow [[President of the Board of Trade]]. She was one of the leading critics of the government when the [[Scott Report]] published its findings into the [[Arms-to-Iraq]] scandal in 1996.

The Labour party won a [[landslide victory]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]] and despite her connections to the old left of the party and the [[trade union]] movement, with which Tony Blair has an uneasy relationship, Margaret Beckett held a number of important positions in the Blair government. After the election she was appointed [[President of the Board of Trade]] (a position the title of which would later revert to [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]]); the first woman to have held the post. She was succeeded by [[Peter Mandelson]] in July 1998.

Beckett was then [[Leader of the House of Commons]] from 1998 until her replacement by [[Robin Cook]] in June 2001. Her tenure saw the introduction of Westminster Hall debates, which are debates held in a small chamber near Westminster Hall on topics of interest to individual MPs, committee reports, and other matters that would not ordinarily be debated in the Commons chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/P04.pdf |title=House of Commons Factsheet P4: Sittings of the House |month=November | year=2006 |accessdate=2007-12-16 |format=PDF |work=[[British House of Commons]] |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debates that take place in Westminster Hall are often more consensual and informal, and can address the concerns of [[backbenchers]]. She received admiration for her work as Leader of the House,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4977348.stm| title=Profile: Margaret Beckett |date=5 May 2006| accessdate=2007-04-27 | work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2009}} working on this and a number of other elements of the Labour government's modernisation agenda for [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].

===Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, 2001-06===
After the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]], Beckett became Secretary of State at the new [[Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]], created after the old [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]] was abolished in the wake of perceived mismanagement of the [[foot and mouth disease]] [[2001 UK foot and mouth crisis|epidemic in 2001]]. The new department also incorporated some of the functions of the former [[Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions]] (DETR), and was known by its initials, &quot;DEFRA&quot;.

For legal reasons, she was also appointed formally as the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which appointment she held until MAFF was finally dissolved on 27 March 2002 and the remaining functions of the [[Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]] were transferred to the Secretary of State at large.

She held the position of [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] until May 2006, when she was succeeded by [[David Miliband]]. Beckett would be on the front line of the government's efforts to tackle [[climate change]], and attended international conferences on the matter.

During her tenure at Defra, Beckett was re-elected to Parliament for Derby South at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]] with a reduced majority.

In a report published on 29 March 2007 by the Environment Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]], she was criticised for her role in the failures of the [[Rural Payments Agency]] when she had been [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/03/29/nfarms29.xml| title=Beckett should be sacked over farm payments fiasco, say MPs |date=30 March 2007 | accessdate=2007-04-02 | author=Charles Clover| work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign Secretary, 2006-07===
Following the [[UK local elections, 2006|2006 local elections]], [[Tony Blair]] demoted [[Foreign Secretary]] [[Jack Straw (politician)|Jack Straw]], and appointed Margaret Beckett as his successor. She was the first woman to hold the post, and only the second woman to hold one of the [[great offices of state]] (after [[Margaret Thatcher]]). Beckett's appointment came as something of a surprise, for the media and for Beckett herself. She admitted reacting to the news with a four letter word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article680305.ece| title='As he promoted me I replied in one word, with four letters' | accessdate=2007-03-20| work=The Times Online | location=London | date=28 June 2006 | first=Philip | last=Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators claim that she was promoted to Foreign Secretary because she was considered to be a 'safe pair of hands' and a loyal member of the Cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/05/05/britain.beckett/index.html| title=UK has first woman foreign secretary | date=5 May 2006 | accessdate=2007-03-20 | work=CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.euronanotrade.com/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=459&amp;Itemid=71 | title=Media Strategy Guide to Cabinet Reshuffle | accessdate=2007-03-20 | work=Euro Nano Trade Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her experience at [[Defra]] in dealing with international climate change issues has also been cited as a factor in the move.

Margaret Beckett had to adapt quickly to her diplomatic role and within a few hours of her appointment as Foreign Secretary she flew to the [[United Nations]] in New York for an urgent meeting of foreign ministers to discuss the [[Iran]] nuclear weapons crisis. About a month later, Beckett came under fire for not responding quickly enough to the [[2006 Lebanon war]], which saw [[Israel]] invade the country, although some reports suggested that the delay was caused by Cabinet division rather than Mrs Beckett's reluctance to make a public statement on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6207306.stm | title=Commons Confidential: November 2006 | accessdate=2007-03-20 | work=BBC News | date=4 December 2006 | first=Nick | last=Assinder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Beckett Rice.jpg|thumb|250px|Beckett appears with [[Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]], [[Condoleezza Rice]], following her appointment as Foreign Secretary.]]

Beckett is understood to have delegated European issues to the [[Foreign Office]] minister responsible for Europe, [[Geoff Hoon]] who, following his demotion as Defence Secretary, continued to attend Cabinet meetings. Hoon and Beckett were said to have a difficult ministerial relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=8234 | title=Brussels Diary, February 2007 | month=February | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-03-20 | work=Prospect magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/11/03/npolitics103.xml | title=Hoon uses Beckett's absence to reopen issue of EU's future | date=3 November 2006 | accessdate=2007-03-20 | work=Telegraph.co.uk | location=London | first=Brendan | last=Carlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Foreign Secretary, Beckett came in for some trenchant criticism. According to ''[[The Times]]'', she did not stand up well in comparison with the previous Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,1052-2231913.html | title=Being beastly to Beckett | author=William Rees-Mogg |date=16 June 2006 | accessdate=2006-10-31 | work=Times Online | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Spectator]]'' described her as, &quot;at heart, an old, isolationist, pacifist Leftist&quot; and called on her to resign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/online-edition/elsewhere/24342/not-up-to-the-job.thtml | title=Not up to the job |date=2 August 2006 | accessdate=2006-10-31 | author=Simon Heffer | work=The Spectator}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[New Statesman]]'' accused her of allowing the Foreign Office to become subservient to [[10 Downing Street]] after the tenures of Jack Straw and [[Robin Cook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200612180059 | title=Interview: Margaret Beckett | date=18 December 2006 | accessdate=2007-03-27 | author=Mary Riddell and John Kampfner | work=The New Statesman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2006, 37 [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] members in her [[Derby South]] constituency left the party and joined the [[Liberal Democrats]], criticising her approach to the [[2006 Lebanon War|Israeli invasion of Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5285986.stm | title=Beckett suffers Labour defections | work=BBC News | accessdate=2006-10-31 |date=25 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks earlier, Beckett's successor, [[David Miliband]], openly criticised Blair and Beckett during a full cabinet meeting for failing to call for an immediate ceasefire.&lt;ref name=no10rebuff&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5234590.stm | title=No 10 'rebuffed hostilities call' | work=BBC News | accessdate=2007-06-30 |date=2 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Straw and [[Hilary Benn]], then [[International Development Secretary]], later came out against Blair and Beckett as well.&lt;ref name=no10rebuff /&gt;

===Post-Blair years===
Upon taking office, [[Gordon Brown]] made it known that Margaret Beckett would not continue as [[Foreign Secretary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6246832.stm | title=Beckett out as Foreign Secretary] | work=BBC News | accessdate=2008-07-24 |date=27 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 June 2007, Brown selected [[David Miliband]] as her replacement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/gordonbrown/story/0,,2113987,00.html | title=Cabinet at a glance | accessdate=2007-06-28 | work=[[The Guardian]]|date=28 June 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Beckett returned to the back benches.

It was announced on 29 January 2008 that Beckett would become the new head of the Prime Minister's [[Intelligence and Security Committee]], replacing [[Paul Murphy (UK politician)|Paul Murphy]], who became the [[Secretary of State for Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7215925.stm | title=Beckett to head security watchdog | work=BBC News | accessdate=2008-01-29 |date=29 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having been tipped for a possible return to the front bench in July 2008, due to her reputation as a solid media performer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4387167.ece | title=Margaret Beckett tipped for a Cabinet comeback | accessdate=2008-07-24 | work=[[The Times]]|date=24 July 2008 | location=London | first=Philip | last=Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beckett returned to [[Her Majesty's Government|government]] in the [[Cabinet shuffle|reshuffle]] on 3 October 2008 as the [[Minister of State]] for Housing in the [[Communities and Local Government|Department for Communities and Local Government]]. She attended Cabinet meetings, but was not a full member and was not to be entitled to vote on collective decisions. She ultimately was allowed to come back due to her cabinet experience and her economic management in the past.

Beckett is currently a member of the [[Top Level Group|Top Level Group of UK Parliamentarians for Multilateral Nuclear Disarmament and Non-proliferation]], established in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/08/nuclear-disarmament-cross-party-group | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Nuclear-free world ultimate aim of new cross-party pressure group | first=Julian | last=Borger | date=8 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MP expenses scandal===
Beckett was found to have claimed £600 for [[hanging basket]]s and [[pot plant]]s by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in the [[United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal|2009 parliamentary expenses scandal]]. She appeared on [[Question Time (TV series)|''Question Time'']] in [[Grimsby]] where she was [[heckler|heckled]] for calling this claim &quot;an error&quot; and also for her refusal to repay £72,000 of her controversial second home allowance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23692544-details/TV+audience+boos+Beckett+for+refusing+to+pay+back+cash/article.do | title= TV audience boos Beckett for refusing to pay back cash | accessdate=2009-05-15 | work=London Evening Standard|date=15 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As she had no [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] or [[renting|rent]] outstanding it was queried how she managed to claim £72,537 between 2004 and 2008 on a house in her [[constituency]] when she was renting out her London flat and living in a [[grace and favour]] flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5293973/Margaret-Becketts-600-claim-for-hanging-baskets-and-pot-plants-MPs-expenses.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Margaret Beckett&amp;#039;s £600 claim for hanging baskets and pot plants: MPs expenses | first=Gordon | last=Rayner | date=8 May 2009 | accessdate=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bid to become Speaker===
On 10 June 2009, Beckett announced that she wished to replace [[Michael Martin (politician)|Michael Martin]] as [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]]. Mrs Beckett said: &quot;I think at the moment we have got very considerable problems in Parliament. We have got to make changes.... After the next election, if we have a more finely balanced chamber than we have had in the recent past, it will be a very different ball game.... I hope I can help us deal with that.&quot; Beckett received 70 votes in the first round and 74 votes in the second rounds of the 2009 Speaker election. She withdrew following the second round of voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.parliament.uk/2009/06/election-of-the-speaker-latest/ |title=Election of the Speaker: Latest &amp;#124; Parliament News |publisher=News.parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, Beckett wrote to Sir Christopher Kelly, Chairman of the [[Committee on Standards in Public Life]] which is currently investigating MPs' Expenses. In the letter, Beckett says the allowances do not adequately cover MPs' costs, which include political campaigns. ''The Telegraph'' criticised the &quot;self-pitying&quot; letter, saying it will fuel &quot;concern that some MPs are not genuinely committed to reform&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6806398.ece |title= Margaret Beckett in 'take pity' plea on expenses | accessdate=2009-08-23 | work=The Sunday Times|date=23 August 2009 | location=London | first=Isabel | last=Oakeshott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative Vote referendum===
On 26 November 2010, Beckett was announced as the President of the NO2AV campaign, which campaigned to retain the [[First Past the Post]] (FPTP) electoral system at the [[United Kingdom alternative vote referendum, 2011|2011 United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11837428 |title= Labour veterans to oppose change to AV election system | accessdate=2010-11-26 | work=BBC News|date=26 November 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Hugh Meacher''' (born 4 November 1939) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[politician]], who has been the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Oldham West and Royton (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham West and Royton]] since [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]]. Previously he had been the MP for [[Oldham West (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham West]], first elected in [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970]]. On 22 February 2007 he declared that he would be standing for the Labour Leadership, challenging [[Gordon Brown]] and [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6385285.stm Meacher enters Labour leader race]&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 May, however, after talks with John McDonnell, he announced he would stand aside in order to back McDonnell as the &quot;candidate of the left&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.news.yahoo.com/itn/20070514/tuk-meacher-makes-way-for-mcdonnell-dba1618.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==
Born in [[Hemel Hempstead]], the son of an accountant and stock-broker, he was educated at [[Berkhamsted School]], [[New College, Oxford]] and the [[London School of Economics]], where he gained a Diploma in Social Administration. He became a researcher and lecturer in social administration at [[University of Essex|Essex]] and [[University of York|York]] universities and wrote a book about elderly people's treatment in mental hospitals. He was the Labour Party candidate for [[Colchester (UK Parliament constituency)|Colchester]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1966|1966 UK General Election]], and fought the 1968 [[Oldham West by-election, 1968 |Oldham West by-election]] after the resignation of Labour MP [[Leslie Hale]] but lost to Conservative candidate [[Keith Bruce Campbell|Bruce Campbell]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelmeacher.info/2006/01/michael_meacher_biography.html Michael Meacher: Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Parliament==
===Junior minister===
He was first elected to Parliament in 1970 for Oldham West, reversing his previous defeat, and served as a junior minister under [[Harold Wilson]] and [[James Callaghan]] (Under-Secretary for Industry, 1974–75, Under-Secretary for Health and Social Security, 1975–79).  During opposition he was in the [[Shadow Cabinet]] for fourteen years and concurrently lectured at the LSE.  He was seen as a figure on the [[Left-wing|left]] and an ally of [[Tony Benn]] and stood as the left's candidate against [[Roy Hattersley]] in the 1983 deputy leadership election.

=== Blair Ministry ===
He was an elected member of the Shadow Cabinet from 1983 to 1997, but [[Tony Blair]] refused to appoint him to the Cabinet and instead made him Minister of State for the Environment, first at the [[Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions]] (1997–2001), then at the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] (2001–2003). Despite Blair's hostility, Meacher gained a reputation for being a politician who was on top of a complex brief&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epolitix.com/EN/ForumBriefs/200208/9C489341-05C0-477C-9244-88FD5EF9C0B5.htm Forum Brief: Earth Summit]&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the longest serving minsters in the same job in the Labour government, from 1997-2003. He was criticised for hypocrisy when he condemned [[second home]] owners; according to the [[BBC]] and Channel 4's [[The Mark Thomas Comedy Product]], he and his wife owned more than one home themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1527092.stm Home, second home], [[BBC News Online]], Thursday, 6 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political activities after 2003 ===
He was sacked in June 2003, to be replaced by [[Elliot Morley]]. Since then he has attacked the government on a number of issues, most notably that of [[genetically modified]] food and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 Iraq war]], though in the run-up to the invasion he had accepted reports by the intelligence services and government saying that Iraq had Chemical Weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/3041526.stm Meacher attacks 'fantasy' case for war], [[BBC News Online]], 3 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Meacher has claimed that a supposed absence of prevention by [[United States]] authorities of the hijackings on 11 September 2001 was suspicious and 'offered an extremely convenient pretext' for subsequent military action in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1036571,00.html &quot;This war on terrorism is bogus&quot;], Michael Meacher, Saturday 6 September 2003, The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/alqaida/story/0,,1266511,00.html &quot;The Pakistan connection&quot;], Michael Meacher, Thursday 22 July 2004, The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; This was seen as giving &quot;credence to conspiracy theories&quot; as claimed by the mainstream newspapers ''[[Daily Mail|The Daily Mail]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|journal=Daily Mail|date=February 22, 2007|title=Michael Meacher: A thorn in Blair's side|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-437828/Michael-Meacher-A-thorn-Blairs-side.html|accessdate=April 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,9115,1038478,00.html Has Meacher completely lost the plot?], [[David Aaronovitch]], Tuesday 9 September 2003, The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Meacher has also written a foreword for [[David Ray Griffin]]'s book ''[[The New Pearl Harbor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|journal=Financial Times|date=June 7, 2008|author=Peter Barber|title=The truth is out there}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005 he introduced an [[early day motion]] on [[climate change]] to parliament, which calls upon the government to commit to yearly [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] emission reductions of 3%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edmi.parliament.uk/EDMi/EDMDetails.aspx?EDMID=28373 Climate Change EDM]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, various articles appeared in the British media claiming Meacher would stand as a [[stalking horse]] against [[Tony Blair]] in order to initiate a leadership contest; others suggested, especially after Brown came out in support of the [[Trident missile]] programme and [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], that Meacher would challenge Brown from the left. He announced his candidacy for the Labour leadership on 22 February 2007.

On 23 September 2006, Michael Meacher became the sixth Labour MP to start a [[blog]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelmeacher.info michaelmeacher.info]&lt;/ref&gt; Meacher has also written articles for ePolitix.com, which has included criticism of Blair and Brown for perceived right-wing policies, including privatization. He has called for a more conciliatory policy in the [[Middle East]], attempts to tackle [[income inequality]], and a greater commitment to reducing energy use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epolitix.com/mpwebsites/mppressreleases/mppressreleasedetails/newsarticle/dont-exclude-the-centre-left-the-debate-over-labours-new-direction-must-go-beyond-the-brownite-ri///mpsite/michael-meacher/|title=Don't exclude the centre-left: The debate over Labour's new direction must go beyond the Brownite right and the Blairite far-right|author=Michael Meacher|publisher=epolitix.com|accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership bid==
On 22 February 2007, Meacher declared his intention to stand for the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2007|leadership of the Labour Party]] claiming he had the support of a large number of MPs. The decisions of both Michael Meacher and [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] to run for the leadership have been controversial{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} with many annoyed that John McDonnell did not consult with other members of the [[Socialist Campaign Group]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}, and many others accusing Michael Meacher of trying to split the nominations and keep John McDonnell off the ballot paper, although neither candidate was thought by many to have any chance of winning the Labour leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourleadership/story/0,,1935398,00.html Meacher denies he has been pressed to stand], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 30 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/leaders/story/0,,2020858,00.html This battle over the political crumbs is pathetic], ''[[The Observer]]'', 25 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 April 2007, ''[[The Guardian]]'' claimed that Meacher had the support of no more than 3 MPs and that his campaign was &quot;virtually dead in the water&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labour/story/0,,2062310,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Brown shows his hand to stifle challenge from left | first=David | last=Hencke | date=21 April 2007 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 April 2007, it was reported that Meacher had reached an agreement with John McDonnell that on the day Tony Blair announced his resignation, whichever of the two of them had the fewer nominations would step aside and allow the other to challenge Gordon Brown.

On 14 May 2007, Meacher agreed to stand aside to allow John McDonnell to be the sole leadership candidate of the left. Subsequent articles reported that Meacher had 21 declarations of support while McDonnell had 24. In the Labour Party's leadership nomination process, McDonnell received nominations from 29 MPs.

==Outside Parliament==
He appeared briefly as himself in the 1985 [[BBC Television]] drama serial ''[[Edge of Darkness]]''.

In 1988 he lost a libel action against the journalist [[Alan Watkins]], who had written an article in November 1984 which included the remark &quot;Mr Meacher likes to claim that he is the son of an agricultural labourer, though I understand that his father was an accountant who retired to work on the family farm because the life suited him better.&quot;

Meacher is a member of the [[Fabian Society]].

'''Neil Gordon Kinnock, Baron Kinnock''' (born 28 March 1942) is a [[Politics of the United Kingdom|Welsh politician]] belonging to [[Labour Party (UK)|the Labour Party]]. He served as a Member of Parliament from [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970]] until [[Islwyn by-election, 1995|1995]] and as [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour Leader]] and [[Leader of the Opposition (UK)|Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition]] from [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1983|1983]] until [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1992|1992]] - his leadership of the party during nearly nine years (all in opposition) making him the longest serving opposition leader in British political history.

Following Labour's defeat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 election]], Kinnock resigned as party leader and after his departure from the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] three years later served as a European Commissioner from 1995–2004. Until the summer of 2009 he was the Chairman of the [[British Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcouncil.org/new/press-office/press-releases/Lord-Kinnock-to-resign-after-four-and-a-half-outstanding-years-as-Chair-of-the-British-Council/ |title=Britishcouncil.org |publisher=Britishcouncil.org |date= |accessdate=2 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinnock served as President of [[Cardiff University]] from 1998 until 2009. Today, he is regarded as one of Labour's elder statesmen.

==Early life==
Kinnock, an [[only child]], was born in [[Tredegar]], Wales.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/halloffame/public_life/neil_kinnock.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; His father Gordon Herbert Kinnock was a coal miner who suffered from [[dermatitis]] and had to find work as a [[labourer]]; and his mother Mary Kinnock was a district nurse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilsford1995&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=David Wilsford|title=Political leaders of contemporary Western Europe: a biographical dictionary|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=B8iJNlWcdIUC&amp;pg=PA236|accessdate=2 October 2011|year=1995|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-28623-0|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DavisHerrmann1982&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hunter Davis|author2=Frank Herrmann|title=Great Britain|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eaYaAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=2 October 2011|date=July 1982|publisher=H. Hamilton|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon died of a heart attack in November 1971 aged 64;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones1994&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Eileen Jones|title=Neil Kinnock|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zn1nAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=2 October 2011|date=29 April 1994|publisher=Hale|isbn=978-0-7090-5239-5|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary died the following month aged 61.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones1994&quot;/&gt;

In 1953, 11-year-old Kinnock began his secondary education at [[Lewis School, Pengam]], which he later criticised for its record on [[School corporal punishment|caning in schools]].  He went on to the [[University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire]], obtaining a degree in industrial relations and history in 1965. A year later, Kinnock obtained a postgraduate diploma in education. Between August 1966 and May 1970, he worked as a tutor for a [[Workers' Educational Association]] (WEA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3044134.stm | work=BBC News | first=Mark | last=Davies | title=Profile: Neil Kinnock | date=4 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been married to [[Glenys Kinnock|Glenys]] since 1967. They have two children – son [[Stephen Kinnock|Stephen]] (born January 1970), and daughter Rachel (born 1971). They now have four grandchildren.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}Glenys has also served the Labour Party as a Member of European Parliament.

==Member of Parliament==
In June 1969 he won the Labour Party nomination for the [[Bedwellty (UK Parliament constituency)|constituency of Bedwellty]] in Wales (later [[Islwyn (UK Parliament constituency)|Islwyn]]) for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|following general election]]. He was elected on 18 June 1970 and became a member of the [[National Executive Committee of the Labour Party]] in October 1978. On becoming an MP for the first time, his father said &quot;Remember Neil, MP stands not just for Member of Parliament, but also for Man of Principle&quot;. Labour government policy at the time was in favour of devolution for Wales, but the wider party was split. Calling himself a 'unionist', Kinnock was one of six south Wales Labour MPs to campaign against devolution on centralist, essentially British-nationalist grounds. He dismissed the idea of a Welsh identity, saying that &quot;between the mid-sixteenth century and the mid-eighteenth century Wales had practically no history at all, and even before that it was the history of rural brigands who have been ennobled by being called princes&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gwynfor&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Gwynfor|title=The Fight for Welsh Freedom|publisher=Y Lolfa Cyf|year=2000|location=Talybont|isbn=0-86243-515-3|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Wales referendum, 1979]], the proposal for devolution was rejected.

Following Labour's defeat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]], [[James Callaghan]] appointed Neil Kinnock to the [[Shadow Cabinet]] as Education spokesman. His ambition was noted by other MPs, and [[David Owen]]'s opposition to the changes to the electoral college was thought to be motivated by the realisation that they would favour Kinnock's succession. He remained as Education spokesman following the resignation of Callaghan as party leader and the election of [[Michael Foot]] as his successor in late 1980. 

He was known as a left-winger, and gained notoriety for his attacks on [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s handling of the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.

==Leadership of the Labour Party==
===First period (1983–1987)===
Shortly after Labour's hefty election defeat in June 1983, the almost 70-year-old Michael Foot resigned as leader and from the outset it was expected that Kinnock would succeed him. He was finally elected as Labour Party leader on 2 October 1983, with 71% of the vote, and [[Roy Hattersley]] was elected as his deputy; their prospective partnership was considered to be a 'dream ticket'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/2/newsid_2486000/2486483.stm|title=1983: 'Dream ticket' wins Labour leadership|work=On This Day|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=29 September 2010|date=2 October 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first period as party leader – between the 1983 and 1987 elections – was dominated by his struggle with the [[hard left]], then still strong in the party. Kinnock was determined to move the party's political standing to a centre-left position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge87.shtml General election: &quot;11 June 1987&quot;], BBC Politics 97&lt;/ref&gt; Although Kinnock had come from the [[Tribune (magazine)#The Tribune Group|Tribune]] left of the party, he parted company with many of his former allies after his appointment to the shadow cabinet. 

In 1981, when still Labour's Education spokesman, Kinnock was alleged to have effectively scuppered [[Tony Benn]]'s attempt to replace [[Denis Healey]] as Labour's deputy leader by first supporting the candidacy of the more traditionalist Tribunite [[John Silkin]] and then urging Silkin supporters to abstain on the second, run-off, ballot.

All this meant that Kinnock had made plenty of enemies on the left by the time he was elected as leader, though a substantial number of former Bennites gave him strong backing. He was almost immediately in serious difficulty as a result of [[Arthur Scargill]]'s decision to lead his union, the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] (NUM) into a national strike (in opposition to pit closures) without a members' ballot. The NUM was widely regarded as the labour movement's [[praetorian guard]] and the strike convulsed the Labour movement.{{Who|date=July 2010}} Kinnock supported the aim of the strike – which he famously dubbed the &quot;case for coal&quot; – but, as an MP from a mining area, was bitterly critical of the tactics employed. In 1985 he made his criticisms public in a speech to Labour's conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.britishpoliticalspeech.org/speech-archive.htm?speech=191 | work=British Political Speeches | title= Leader's speech, Bournemouth 1985: Neil Kinnock (Labour) | date=3 March 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;:{{cquote|The strike wore on. The violence built up because the single tactic chosen was that of mass picketing, and so we saw policing on a scale and with a system that has never been seen in Britain before. The court actions came, and by the attitude to the court actions, the NUM leadership ensured that they would face crippling damages as a consequence. To the question: &quot;How did this position arise?&quot;, the man from the lodge in my constituency said: &quot;It arose because nobody really thought it out.&quot;}}

The strike's defeat early in the year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/3/newsid_2515000/2515019.stm | work=BBC News | title=1985: Miners call off year-long strike | date=3 March 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the bad publicity associated with the [[entryism]] practised by the [[Militant tendency]] were the immediate background for the 1985 Labour Party conference.&lt;ref&gt;For a history of the Militant tendency in the Labour Party, see Eric Shaw ''Discipline and Discord in the Labour Party: The Politics of Managerial Control in the Labour Party, 1951-87'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1988, p.218-90 and Michael Crick ''The March of Militant'', London: Faber, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in the year left-wing councils had [[rate-capping rebellion|protested at Government restriction of their budgets]] by refusing to set budgets, resulting in a budget crisis in Militant-dominated [[Liverpool City Council]]. Kinnock attacked Militant and their conduct in [[Liverpool]] in one of the best remembered passages of any post-war British political speech:

{{cquote|I'll tell you what happens with impossible promises. You start with far-fetched resolutions. They are then pickled into a rigid dogma, a code, and you go through the years sticking to that, out-dated, misplaced, irrelevant to the real needs, and you end in the grotesque chaos of a Labour council – a ''Labour'' council! – hiring taxis to scuttle round a city handing out [[Layoff|redundancy]] notices to its own workers.}}

One Liverpool MP, [[Eric Heffer]], a member of the NEC left the conference stage in disgust at Kinnock's comments.&lt;ref&gt;James Naughtie [http://century.guardian.co.uk/1980-1989/Story/0,6051,108249,00.html &quot;Labour in Bournemouth&quot;,] ''The Guardian'', 2 October 1985&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1986 the Labour Party finally expelled the deputy leader of Liverpool council, the high profile Militant supporter [[Derek Hatton]], who was found guilty of &quot;manipulating the rules of the district Labour party&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/12/newsid_2511000/2511839.stm &quot;1986: Labour expels Militant Hatton&quot;], BBC On This Day, 12 June&lt;/ref&gt; By 1986, the party's position appeared to strengthen further with excellent local election results and a thorough [[rebranding]] of the party under the direction of Kinnock's director of communications [[Peter Mandelson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/1989/oct/02/reshuffle1999.mandelson | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Peter | last=Lennon | title=Guarding the good name of the rose | date=2 October 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labour, now sporting a continental [[social democracy|social democratic]] style emblem of a [[rose]], appeared to be able to run the governing [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] close, but [[Margaret Thatcher]] did not let Labour's makeover go unchallenged.

The Conservatives' 1986 conference was well-managed, and effectively relaunched the Conservatives as a party of radical [[free-market]] liberalism. Labour suffered from a persistent image of extremism, especially as Kinnock's campaign to root out Militant dragged on as figures on the [[hard left]] of the party tried to stop its progress. Opinion polls showed that voters favoured retaining Britain's nuclear weapons and believed that the Conservatives would be better than Labour at defending the country.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony King (ed.), ''British Political Opinion, 1937–2000: The Gallup Polls'' (Politico's, 2001), pp. 105–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1987 general election===
In early 1987, Labour lost a by-election in Greenwich to the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]]'s [[Rosie Barnes]]. As a result, Labour faced the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 election]] in some danger of coming third in the popular vote. In secret, Labour's aim became to secure second place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-10518842 | work=BBC News | title=The rise and fall of New Labour | date=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labour fought a professional campaign that at one point scared the Tories into thinking they might lose. Mandelson and his team had revolutionised Labour's communications – a transformation symbolised by a [[party election broadcast]] popularly known as &quot;Kinnock: The Movie&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFgjCP6qpfU&lt;/ref&gt; This was directed by [[Hugh Hudson]] and featured Kinnock's 1985 conference speech, and shots of him and Glenys walking on the [[Great Orme]] in [[Llandudno]] (so emphasising his appeal as a family man and associating him with images of Wales away from the coalmining communities where he grew up), and a speech to that year's [[Welsh Labour Party]] conference asking why he was the &quot;first Kinnock in a thousand generations&quot; to go to university.

Then-Delaware Senator, presidential candidate and future U.S. Vice President [[Joe Biden]] was so impressed with Kinnock's speech that he borrowed lines from it in his own campaign speeches in the summer of 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/2607505/Joe-Biden-plagiarised-Neil-Kinnock-speech.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Joe Biden plagiarised Neil Kinnock speech | date=23 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On polling day, Labour easily took second place, but with only 31 per cent to the SDP-Liberal Alliance's 22 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.election.demon.co.uk/ge1987.html&lt;/ref&gt; Labour was still more than ten percentage points behind the Conservatives, who retained a three-figure majority in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. However, the Conservative government's majority had come down from 144 in 1983 to 102.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393315.stm | work=BBC News | title=1987: Thatcher's third victory | date=5 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;Significantly, it had gained 20 seats at the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/in_depth/election_battles/1987_over.stm | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labour won extra seats in Scotland, Wales and Northern England, but lost ground particularly in Southern England and London, where the Tories still dominated.

===Second period (1987–1992)===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=February 2011}}
The second period of Kinnock's leadership was dominated by his drive to reform the party's policies and so win power. This began with an exercise dubbed the policy review, the most high-profile aspect of which was a series of consultations with the public known as &quot;Labour Listens&quot; in the autumn of 1987.&lt;ref&gt;http://osb.revues.org/861&lt;/ref&gt;

In organisational terms, the party leadership continued to battle with the Militant tendency, though by now Militant was in retreat in the party and was simultaneously attracted by the opportunities to grow outside Labour's ranks – opportunities largely created by [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s hugely unpopular [[Community Charge|poll tax]].

After Labour Listens, the party went on, in 1988, to produce a new statement of aims and values – meant to supplement and supplant the formulation of [[Clause IV]] of the party's constitution (though, crucially, this was not actually replaced until 1995 under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]]) and was closely modelled on [[Anthony Crosland]]'s social-democratic thinking – emphasising equality rather than [[public ownership]]. At the same time the commitment to unilateral nuclear disarmament was dropped, and reforms of Party Conference and the National Executive meant that local parties lost much of their ability to influence policy.

In 1988, [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1988|Kinnock was challenged]] by [[Tony Benn]] for the party leadership. Later many identified this as a particularly low period in Kinnock's leadership – as he appeared mired in internal battles after five years of leadership and the Conservatives still dominating the scene and ahead in the opinion polls. In the end, though, Kinnock won a decisive victory over Benn and would soon enjoy a substantial rise in support&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

 |accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The policy review – reporting in 1989 – coincided with Labour's move ahead in the polls as the poll tax row was destroying Conservative support, and Labour won big victories in local by-elections. 

In December 1989, he abandoned the Labour policy on [[Closed shop|closed shops]] - a decision seen by many as a move away from traditional socialist policies to a more Europe-wide agenda, and also a move to rid the party of its image of being run by the unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/18/newsid_2538000/2538439.stm | work=BBC News | title=1989: Labour's union U-turn | date=18 December 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinnock was also perceived as scoring in debates over Margaret Thatcher in the Commons – previously an area in which he was seen as weak – and finally Conservative MPs challenged Thatcher's leadership and she resigned on 22 November 1990 to be succeeded by [[John Major]]. Kinnock greeted Thatcher's resignation by describing it as &quot;very good news&quot; and demanded an immediate general election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GgAkMeB-_c]&lt;/ref&gt;

Public reaction to Major's elevation was highly positive. A new Prime Minister and the fact that Kinnock was now current leader of a major party reduced the impact of calls for &quot;Time for a Change&quot;. Neil Kinnock's showing in the opinion polls dipped; before Mrs Thatcher's resignation, Labour had been up to 10 points ahead of the Tories in the opinion polls (an [[Ipsos MORI]] poll in April 1990 had actually shown Labour more than 20 points ahead of the Tories), but many opinion polls were actually showing the Tories with more support than Labour, in spite of the [[Early 1990s recession|deepening recession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8280050.stm | work=BBC News | title=Poll tracker: Interactive guide to the opinion polls | date=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1992 general election, backbenches and retirement===
[[File:Sunkinnock.jpg|thumb|''Sun'' headline]]
In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 election]], Labour made considerable progress – reducing the Conservative majority to just 21 seats. It came as a shock to many when the Conservatives won a majority, but the perceived triumphalism of a Labour party [[Sheffield Rally|rally in Sheffield]] (together with Kinnock's performance on the podium) may have helped
put voters off. Although most of those directly involved in the campaign believe that the rally really came to widespread attention only after the election itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/sheffield/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8170000/8170344.stm | work=BBC News | first=Stephanie | last=Barnard | title=Kinnock came and didn't conquer | date=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the run-up to the election, held on 9 April 1992, most opinion polls had suggested that the election would end in a [[hung parliament]] or a narrow Labour majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393317.stm | work=BBC News | title=1992: Tories win again against odds | date=5 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day of the general election, ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' ran a front page featuring Kinnock (headline: '[[It's The Sun Wot Won It|If Kinnock wins today will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights]]') that he blamed in his [[resignation speech]] for losing Labour the election. Kinnock also blamed his defeat on the other newspapers who had backed the Tories in the run-up to the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/13/newsid_2830000/2830895.stm|title=1992: Labour's Neil Kinnock resigns|work=On This Day|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=29 September 2010|date=13 April 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;However, the traditional Labour supporting [[Daily Mirror]] had backed Kinnock at the 1987&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?q=1987+daily+mirror&amp;um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=BnLZCIzYaAo6qM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/2010/04/20/general-election-2010-a-century-of-daily-mirror-front-pages-115875-22198683/&amp;docid=aNc1HOuYhTwybM&amp;imgurl=http://images.mirror.co.uk/upl/m4/apr2010/4/9/image-3-for-general-election-2010-front-pages-gallery-897157967.jpg&amp;w=284&amp;h=350&amp;ei=jYMQT4HGJcX28QOzlpXvAw&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=779&amp;vpy=195&amp;dur=1251&amp;hovh=249&amp;hovw=202&amp;tx=147&amp;ty=91&amp;sig=108568670295982046080&amp;page=3&amp;tbnh=126&amp;tbnw=102&amp;start=35&amp;ndsp=19&amp;ved=1t:429,r:5,s:35&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=630]&lt;/ref&gt;election and again in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/2010/04/20/general-election-2010-a-century-of-daily-mirror-front-pages-115875-22198683/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the three years leading up to the 1992 election, Labour had consistently topped the opinion polls, with 1991 seeing the Tories (rejuvenated by the arrival of a new leader in John Major the previous November) snatch the lead off Labour more than once before Labour regained it&lt;ref&gt;http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/historical-polls/voting-intention-1987-1992&lt;/ref&gt;. Since Major's election as leader, Kinnock spent the end of 1990&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/kinnock-challenges-tories-to-call-election-1.548889&lt;/ref&gt; and most of 1991 putting pressure on Major to hold the election that year, but Major had held out and insisted that there would be no general election in 1991.

Kinnock himself later claimed to have half-expected his defeat in the 1992 election and proceeded to turn himself into a media personality, even hosting a chat show on [[BBC Wales]] and twice appearing – with considerable success – on the topical panel show ''[[Have I Got News For You]]'' within a year of the defeat. Many years later, he returned to appear as a guest host of the programme.

Kinnock announced his resignation as Labour Party leader on 13 April 1992, ending eight and a half years in the role - making him the longest serving opposition leader in British political history. He had gained this distinction in November 1990, and no subsequent opposition party leader has yet matched this record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.highbeam.com/4341/article-1G1-8493082/coal-miner-son]&lt;/ref&gt;

John Smith, previously Shadow Chancellor, was his successor as party leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/13/newsid_2830000/2830895.stm | work=BBC News | title=1992: Labour's Neil Kinnock resigns | date=13 April 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He remains on the Advisory Council of the [[Institute for Public Policy Research]], which he helped set up in the 1980s.

He was an enthusiastic supporter of [[Ed Miliband]]'s campaign to lead the Labour Party in 2010, and was reported as telling activists, when Ed Miliband won, &quot;We've got our party back&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Brian | last = Wheeler | title = &quot;We've got our party back,&quot; says Lord Kinnock | date = 29 September 2010 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11434981 |publisher=BBC News  | accessdate = 29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biden incident===
Kinnock gained attention in the United States in 1987 when it was discovered that then-[[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Joe Biden]] of [[Delaware]] quoted one of Kinnock's speeches but forgot to credit him during [[Joe Biden presidential campaign, 1988|his 1988 presidential campaign]] in a speech at a Democratic debate in [[Iowa]] in August 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DD1531F931A2575AC0A961948260 | title= Biden's Debate Finale: An Echo From Abroad | author=Dowd, Maureen |work=The New York Times  | date=12 September 1987 |authorlink=Maureen Dowd}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to Biden's withdrawing from the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0DF173AF937A1575AC0A961948260 | title= Biden Withdraws Bid for President in Wake of Furor | author=Dionne Jr., E. J. |work=The New York Times  | date=24 September 1987 |authorlink=E. J. Dionne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biden was elected Vice President of the United States in 2008; on 18 January 2009 [[Glenys Kinnock]] revealed on the [[BBC]]'s ''[[The Andrew Marr Show|Andrew Marr Show]]'' that she and Neil Kinnock had received a personal invitation from Biden to attend the [[Inauguration of Barack Obama|inauguration of Barack Obama and Biden]] on 20 January 2009 at the [[United States Capitol]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].

===European Union Commissioner===
Kinnock was appointed one of Britain's two members of the [[European Commission]], which he served first as Transport Commissioner under President [[Jacques Santer]], in early 1995; marking the end of his 25 years in UK parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/conservatives-trounced-in-poll-1573413.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Conservatives trounced in poll | date=17 February 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came less than a year after the death of his successor as Labour leader John Smith and the election of [[Tony Blair]] as the party's new leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/21/newsid_2515000/2515825.stm | work=BBC News | title=1994: Labour chooses Blair | date=21 July 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was obliged to resign as part of the forced, collective [[Santer Commission#Resignation|resignation of the Commission]] in 1999, but there was never any suggestion that he himself had done anything corrupt. He was re-appointed to the Commission under new President [[Romano Prodi]]. He now became one of the Vice-Presidents of the European Commission. His term of office as a Commissioner was due to expire on 30 October 2004, but was delayed owing to the withdrawal of the new Commissioners. During this second term of office on the Commission, he was responsible for introducing new staff regulations for EU officials, a significant feature of which was substantial salary cuts for everyone employed after 1 May 2004, reduced pension prospects for many others, and gradually worsening employment conditions. This made him disliked by many EU staff members, although the pressure on budgets that largely drove these changes had actually been imposed on the Commission from above by the Member States in Council.

In February 2004 it was announced that with effect from 1 November 2004 Kinnock would become head of the [[British Council]]. Coincidentally, at the same time, his son [[Stephen Kinnock|Stephen]] became head of the British Council branch in [[St. Petersburg, Russia]]. At the end of October, it was announced that he would become a member of the House of Lords (intending to be a working peer), when he was able to leave his EU responsibilities. In 1977, he had remained in the House of Commons, with [[Dennis Skinner]], while other MPs walked to the Lords to hear the [[Queen's speech]] opening the new parliament. He had dismissed going to the Lords in recent interviews. Kinnock explained his change of attitude, despite the continuing presence of 90 hereditary peers and appointment by patronage, by asserting that the Lords was a good base for campaigning.

===Life peerage===
He was introduced to the [[House of Lords]] on 31 January 2005, after being created '''Baron Kinnock''', of [[Bedwellty]] in the County of [[Gwent (county)|Gwent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepeerage.com/p19150.htm Neil Gordon Kinnock, Baron Kinnock], thePeerage.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldjournal/238/031.htm House of Lords Journal 238 (Session 2004–05)], Monday, 31 January 2005; p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; On assuming his seat he stated, &quot;I accepted the kind invitation to enter the House of Lords as a working peer for practical political reasons.&quot; When his peerage was first announced, he said, &quot;It will give me the opportunity... to contribute to the national debate on issues like higher education, research, Europe and foreign policy.&quot; His peerage meant that the Labour and Conservative parties were equal in numbers in the upper house of Parliament (since then, the number of Labour members has overtaken the number of Conservative members). Kinnock was a long-time critic of the [[House of Lords]], and his acceptance of a peerage led him to be accused of hypocrisy, by [[Will Self]],&lt;ref&gt;Notably when Kinnock appeared, as the guest presenter, in an episode of ''[[Have I Got News For You]]'', on Friday [[List of Have I Got News For You episodes#Series 28|3 December 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4223265.stm|title=Baron Kinnock makes Lords debut|publisher=BBC News |date=31 January 2005|accessdate=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He is married to Glenys Kinnock, Britain's Minister for Africa and the United Nations from 2009 to 2010, and a Labour [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP) from 1994 to 2009. When she was made a [[life peer]] in 2009, they became one of the few couples to both hold titles in their own right. The two met while studying at [[Cardiff University|University College, Cardiff]], where they were known as &quot;the power and the glory&quot; (Glenys the power), and they married on 25 March 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

He is assistant director of the British Council in [[Sierra Leone]]. Rachel worked in the Political Office at [[10 Downing Street]] under [[Gordon Brown]].

In 1984, Kinnock appeared in the video for the [[Tracey Ullman]] song &quot;[[My Girl (Madness song)#My Guy's Mad at Me|My Guy]]&quot; (his daughter was a fan) as a someone with a clipboard canvassing on a [[council estate]]. The record reached #23 in the charts.

On 26 April 2006, Neil Kinnock was given a six-month driving ban after being found guilty of two speeding offences along the [[M4 motorway]], west of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/4947284.stm|title=Neil Kinnock banned from driving|publisher=BBC News |date=26 April 2006|accessdate=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neil Kinnock is a lifelong [[Cardiff City F.C.]] fan and regularly attends matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/cardiff_city/1944739.stm|title=Cardiff's Sunday quest|publisher=BBC News |date=23 April 2002|accessdate=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinnock is an [[agnostic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2011 Kinnock took part in the [[BBC Wales]] programme [[Coming Home (TV series)|Coming Home]] about his Welsh family history, the programme was broadcast on 30th November 2011.

Kinnock had a cameo role in [[Sky1]]'s Stella (Episode 3, Series one), first broadcast 19 January 2012.
===Satire===
The character Paris Geller in popular 2000's U.S. TV programme ''[[The Gilmore Girls]]'' referred to Kinnock's voice as something she swooned over in her younger days; this may have been a tongue-in-cheek remark. The professor she dated in the series was Michael York who spoke with a strong English accent; Kinnock speaks with a distinct Welsh accent.

In Episode 4 (&quot;Animals&quot;) of the British sitcom [[Men Behaving Badly]], Series 1, Dermot (played by [[Harry Enfield]]) says to Gary (played by [[Martin Clunes]]), &quot;There she was, just standing there, making [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] look like Neil Kinnock.&quot; He was referring to Kate (played by [[Louise Hunt]]).

The '''Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland''' is the head of [[Government of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty's Government]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The Prime Minister and [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] (consisting of all the most senior [[minister (government)|ministers]], who are government department heads) are collectively [[Accountability#Political accountability|accountable]] for their policies and actions to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Sovereign]], to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], to their [[List of political parties in the United Kingdom|political party]] and ultimately to the [[electorate]]. The {{asof|2010|10|alt=[[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|current]] Prime Minister}}, [[David Cameron]], leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], was appointed on 11 May 2010.

The position of Prime Minister was not created; it evolved slowly and erratically over three hundred years due to numerous acts of Parliament, political developments, and accidents of history. The office is therefore best understood from a historical perspective. The origins of the position are found in constitutional changes that occurred during the Revolutionary Settlement (1688–1720) and the resulting shift of political power from the Sovereign to Parliament. Although the Sovereign was not stripped of his or her ancient prerogatives and legally remained the head of government, politically it gradually became necessary for him or her to govern through a Prime Minister who could command a majority in Parliament.

By the 1830s the Westminster system of government (or cabinet government) had emerged; the Prime Minister had become &quot;primus inter pares&quot; or the first among equals in the Cabinet and the [[head of government]] in the United Kingdom. The political position of Prime Minister was enhanced by the development of modern political parties, the introduction of mass communication (inexpensive newspapers, radio, television and the internet), and photography. By the turn of the 20th century the modern premiership had emerged; the office had become the pre-eminent position in the constitutional hierarchy vis-a-vis the Sovereign, Parliament and Cabinet.

As leader of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], the Prime Minister's authority was further enhanced by the Parliament Act of 1911 which marginalised the influence of the [[House of Lords]] in the law-making process.  The accretion of so much political power in one position gave rise to concerns that the office had become too &quot;presidential&quot;, and that the Prime Minister was an &quot;elected Monarch&quot;. Late in the 20th century several acts of Parliament and political changes placed some limits on the Premier's authority.

==Authority==
As the &quot;Head of Her Majesty's Government&quot; the modern Prime Minister leads the Cabinet (the [[Executive (government)|Executive]]). In addition the Prime Minister leads a major political party and generally commands a majority in the House of Commons (the lower house of the [[Legislature]]). As such the incumbent wields both legislative and executive powers. Under the British system there is a unity of powers rather than [[separation of powers|separation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Le May|Le May]], 98–99. Walter Bagehot, an authority on 19th century British government, said this unity is &quot;the efficient secret&quot; of its constitution. Bagehot's description of the &quot;efficient part&quot; of the British constitution is quoted by Le May and many other standard texts: &quot;The efficient secret of the English Constitution may be described as the close union, the nearly complete fusion, of the executive and legislative powers. No doubt, by the traditional theory, as it exists in all the books, the goodness of our constitution consists in the entire separation of the legislative and executive authorities, but in truth its merit consists in their singular approximation. The connecting link is the Cabinet ... A Cabinet is a combing committee&amp;nbsp;— a hyphen which joins a buckle which fastens the legislative part of the State to the executive part of the State. In its origin it belongs to the one, in its functions it belongs to the other.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  In the House of Commons, the Prime Minister guides the law-making process with the goal of enacting the legislative agenda of their political party. In an executive capacity the Prime Minister appoints (and may dismiss) all other cabinet members and [[minister (government)|ministers]], and co-ordinates the policies and activities of all government departments, and the staff of the Civil Service. The Prime Minister also acts as the public &quot;face&quot; and &quot;voice&quot; of Her Majesty's Government, both at home and abroad. Solely upon the advice of the Prime Minister, the Sovereign exercises many statutory and prerogative powers, including high judicial, political, official and [[Church of England]] ecclesiastical appointments; the conferral of peerages, knighthoods, decorations and other honours; and prior to the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]], the dissolution of Parliament.

==Constitutional background==
{{Politics of the United Kingdom}}

The British system of government is based on an [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|&quot;unwritten&quot; constitution]], meaning that it is not codified into a single document.&lt;ref&gt;[[#King|King]], pages 3–8. King makes the point that much of the British constitution is in fact written and that no constitution is written down in its entirety. The distinctive feature of the British constitution, he says, is that it is not codified.&lt;/ref&gt; Scattered across 800 years, the British constitution consists of many documents—such as [[Magna Carta]] (1215), the [[Great Reform Bill]] (1832), and the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949|Parliament Act]] (1911)—and, most important for the evolution of the office of Prime Minister, customs known as [[constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]]s that became accepted practice.  In 1841, Prime Minister Lord Melbourne explained this feature of the British constitution in a letter to young Queen Victoria:

:All the political part of the English Constitution is fully understood, and distinctly stated in Blackstone and many other books, but the Ministerial part, the work of conducting the executive government, has rested so much on practice, on usage, on understanding, that there is no particular publication to which reference can be made for the explanation and description of it.  It is to be sought in debates, in protests, in letters, in memoirs, and wherever it can be picked up.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Le May|Le May]], p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost one hundred years later, Prime Minister Herbert Asquith made the same point in his memoirs:

:In this country we live . . . under an unwritten Constitution.  It is true that we have on the Statute-book great instruments like Magna Carta, the Petition of Right, and the Bill of Rights which define and secure many of our rights and privileges; but the great bulk of our constitutional liberties and . . . our constitutional practices do not derive their validity and sanction from any Bill which has received the formal assent of the King, Lords and Commons.  They rest on usage, custom, convention, often of slow growth in their early stages, not always uniform, but which in the course of time received universal observance and respect.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in [[#Hanchant|Hanchant]], p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 20th century the relationship between the Prime Minister vis-a-vis the Sovereign, Parliament and Cabinet was defined entirely by these unwritten conventions of the constitution.  Despite its growing dominance in the constitutional hierarchy, the Premiership was given little formal recognition; the legal fiction was maintained that the Sovereign still governed directly. For example, many of the Prime Minister's executive and legislative powers are actually “[[royal prerogative]]s” and still formally vested in the Head of State, the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Sovereign]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Low|Low]], p.155. In 1902, for example, Arthur Balfour said, &quot;The Prime Minister has no salary as Prime Minister. He has no statutory duties as Prime Minister, his name occurs in no Acts of Parliament, and though holding the most important place in the constitutional hierarchy, he has no place which is recognized by the laws of his country. This is a strange paradox&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this arrangement Britain might appear to have two executives: the Prime Minister and Sovereign. The concept of &quot;[[the Crown]]&quot; resolves this paradox.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Low|Low]], p. 255 &quot;There is no distinction&quot;, said Gladstone, &quot;more vital to the practice of the British constitution or to the right judgment upon it than the distinction between the Sovereign and the Crown.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Crown symbolises the state’s authority to govern: to make laws and execute them, impose taxes and collect them, declare war and make peace. Before the &quot;[[Glorious Revolution]]&quot; of 1688 the Sovereign wore the Crown and exercised the powers it symbolises. Afterwards Parliament gradually forced Sovereigns to assume a neutral political position. Parliament placed the Crown in &quot;commission&quot;, entrusting its authority to responsible Ministers (the Prime Minister and Cabinet), accountable for their policies and actions to Parliament and the people. Although the Sovereign still wears the Crown and her prerogative powers are still legally intact,&lt;ref group=note&gt;The Sovereign's prerogative powers are sometimes called [[reserve powers]]. They include the sole authority to dismiss a Prime Minister and government of the day in extremely rare and exceptional circumstances, and other essential powers (such as the veto, and summoning, proroguing and dissolving Parliament) to preserve the stability of the nation. Reserve powers are available to her to use without the consent of Parliament. She also, through her various Governor Generals in the Commonwealth nations, has various and differed reserve powers in each realm. Reserve powers, in practice, are the court of absolute last resort in resolving situations that fundamentally threaten the security and stability of the nation as a whole and are almost never used. [[Elizabeth II]] has never used her reserve powers.&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament has removed her from everyday governance, leaving her in practice with three constitutional rights: to be kept informed, to advise, and to warn.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bagehot|Bagehot]], p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Low|Low]], pages 255–258.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundations of the office of Prime Minister==
===Revolutionary settlement===
Because the Premiership was not intentionally created, there is no exact date when its evolution began. A meaningful starting point, however, is 1688-9 when [[James II of England|James II]] fled [[Kingdom of England|England]] and the [[Parliament of England]] confirmed William and Mary as joint constitutional monarchs, enacting legislation that limited their authority and that of their successors: the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights (1689)]], the [[Mutiny Acts|Mutiny Bill]] (1689), the [[Triennial Acts|Triennial Bill]] (1694), the [[Treason Act 1695|Treason Act (1696)]] and the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement (1701)]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Knappen|Knappen]], pages 448–451.&lt;/ref&gt; Known collectively as the Revolutionary Settlement, these acts transformed the constitution, shifting the balance of power from the Sovereign to Parliament. They also provided the basis for the evolution of the office of Prime Minister, which did not exist at that time.

===Treasury Bench===
The Revolutionary Settlement gave the Commons control over finances and legislation and changed the relationship between the Executive and the Legislature. For want of money, Sovereigns had to summon Parliament annually and could no longer dissolve or prorogue it without its advice and consent. Parliament became a permanent feature of political life.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], pages 371–373&lt;/ref&gt; The veto fell into disuse because Sovereigns feared that if they denied legislation Parliament would deny them money. No Sovereign has denied [[royal assent]] since Queen Anne vetoed the [[Scottish Militia Bill 1708|Scottish Militia Bill]] in 1708.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], p. 382&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:British House of Commons 1834.jpg|left|thumb|Late in the 17th century Treasury Ministers began to attend the Commons regularly. They were given a reserved place, called the Treasury Bench, to the Speaker's right where the Prime Minister and senior Cabinet members sit today]]

Treasury officials and other department heads were drawn into Parliament serving as liaisons between it and the Sovereign. Ministers had to present the government's policies, and negotiate with Members to gain the support of the majority; they had to explain the government's financial needs, suggest ways of meeting them and give an account of how money had been spent. The Sovereign’s representatives attended Commons sessions so regularly that they were given reserved seats at the front, known as the Treasury Bench. This is the beginning of &quot;unity of powers&quot;: the Sovereign's Ministers (the Executive) became leading members of Parliament (the Legislature). Today the Prime Minister ([[First Lord of the Treasury]]), the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] (responsible for [[United Kingdom budget|The Budget]]) and other senior members of the Cabinet sit on the Treasury bench and present policies in much the same way Ministers did late in the 17th century.

===Standing Order 66===
After the Revolution there was a constant threat that non-government members of Parliament would ruin the country's finances by proposing ill-considered money bills. Vying for control to avoid chaos the Crown's Ministers gained an advantage in 1706 when the Commons informally declared, &quot;That this House will receive no petition for any sum of money relating to public Service, but what is recommended from the Crown.&quot; On 11 June 1713 this non-binding rule became Standing Order 66: that &quot;the Commons would not vote money for any purpose, except on a motion of a Minister of the Crown.&quot; Standing Order 66 remains in effect today (though renumbered as no. 48),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmstords/2/2.pdf |date=16 December 2009 |page=65 |title=Standing Orders of the House of Commons |format=PDF |location=London, United Kingdom |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; essentially unchanged for three hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Roseveare|Roseveare]], p.80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Empowering Ministers with sole financial initiative had an immediate and lasting impact. Apart from achieving its intended purpose&amp;nbsp;– to stabilise the budgetary process&amp;nbsp;– it gave the Crown a leadership role in the Commons; and, the [[Lord Treasurer]] assumed a leading position among Ministers.

The power of financial initiative was not, however, absolute. Only Ministers might initiate money bills, but Parliament now reviewed and consented to them. Standing Order 66 therefore represents the beginnings of Ministerial responsibility and accountability.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], pages 372–373&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;Prime Minister&quot; appears at this time as an unofficial title for the leader of the government, usually the head of the Treasury.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dodd|Dodd]], p 50 There are a few instances of the use of &quot;Prime&quot; or &quot;First&quot; Minister in the 17th century. After the Restoration in 1660, for example, Lord Clarendon was encouraged to assume the title of &quot;First Minister&quot; in the new government rather than accept a specific office. According to the Duke of Ormonde, however, &quot;He (Clarendon) could not consent to enjoy a pension out of the Exchequer under no other title or pretense but being First Minister . . . [an office] so newly translated out of French into English that it was not enough understood to be liked and everyone would detest it for the burden it was attended with.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Swift, for example, wrote in 1713 about &quot;those who are now commonly called Prime Minister among us&quot;, referring to [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin]] and [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Robert Harley]], [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne's]] Lord Treasurers and chief ministers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marriott|Mariott]], p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1721, every head of the Sovereign's government&amp;nbsp;– with one exception in the 18th century ([[William Pitt the Elder]]) and one in the 19th ([[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]])&amp;nbsp;– has been First Lord of the Treasury.

===Beginnings of the Prime Minister's party leadership===
The modern Prime Minister is the leader of a major political party with millions of followers. In the general election of 1997, for example, 13.5&amp;nbsp;million people voted for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] led by [[Tony Blair]]; 9.6&amp;nbsp;million for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], led by [[John Major]], the previous Prime Minister; and, 5.2&amp;nbsp;million for the [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat Party]] led by [[Paddy Ashdown]]. Generally agreeing on policies, party leaders and their supporters suppress their differences of opinion at the polls for the sake of gaining a majority of seats in the Commons and being able to form a government.

Political parties first appeared during the [[Exclusion Crisis]] of 1678–1681. The [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]], who believed in [[limited monarchy]], wanted to exclude [[James II of England|James Stuart]] from succeeding to the throne because he was a Catholic. The [[Tories (political faction)|Tories]], who believed in the &quot;[[Divine Right of Kings]]&quot;, defended James' hereditary claim. These parties dominated British politics for over 150 years, with the Whigs evolving into the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] and the Tories into the Conservative. Even today, Conservatives are often called &quot;Tories&quot;.

Political parties were not well organised or disciplined in the 17th century. They were more like factions with &quot;members&quot; drifting in and out, collaborating temporarily on issues when it was to their advantage, then disbanding when it was not. A major deterrent to the development of opposing parties was the idea that there could only be one &quot;King's Party&quot; and to oppose it would be disloyal or even treasonous. This idea lingered throughout the 18th century. Nevertheless it became possible at the end of the 17th century to identify Parliaments and Ministries as being either &quot;Whig&quot; or &quot;Tory&quot; in composition.

===Cabinet===
The modern Prime Minister is also the leader of the Cabinet. A convention of the constitution, the modern Cabinet is a group of ministers who formulate policies. As the political heads of government departments Cabinet Ministers ensure that policies are carried out by permanent civil servants. Although the modern Prime Minister selects Ministers, appointment still rests with the Sovereign. With the Prime Minister as its leader, the Cabinet forms the [[executive branch]] of government.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Once in office, the Prime Minister fills not only Cabinet level positions but many other government offices (up to 90 appointments), selected mostly from the House of Commons, distributing them to party members, partly as a reward for their loyalty. The power to make so many appointments to government offices is one of the most effective means the Prime Minister has of maintaining party discipline in the Commons.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;Cabinet&quot; first appears after the Revolutionary Settlement to describe those ministers who conferred privately with the Sovereign. The growth of the Cabinet met with widespread complaint and opposition because its meetings were often held in secret and it excluded the ancient [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] from the Sovereign's circle of advisers, reducing it to an honorary body.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dodd|Dodd]], p. 79. In 1691, for example, a Lord protested, that &quot;'Cabinet-Council' is not a word to be found in our Law-books. We know it not before: we took it for a nick-name. Nothing can fall out more unhappily, than to have a distinction made of the 'Cabinet' and 'Privy-Council' ... If some of the Privy-Council men be trusted, and some not, to whom is a gentleman to apply? Must he ask, &quot;Who is a Cabinet-Counsellor? ... I am sure, these distinctions of some being more trusted than others have given great dissatisfaction.”&lt;/ref&gt; The early Cabinet, like that of today, included the Treasurer and other department heads who sat on the Treasury bench. However, it might also include individuals who were not members of Parliament such as household officers (e.g. the Master of the Horse) and members of the royal family. The exclusion of non-members of Parliament from the Cabinet was essential to the development of ministerial accountability and responsibility.

Both William and Anne appointed and dismissed Cabinet members, attended meetings, made decisions, and followed up on actions. Relieving the Sovereign of these responsibilities and gaining control over the Cabinet's composition was an essential part of evolution of the Premiership. This process began after the Hanoverian Succession. Although [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] (1714–1727) attended Cabinet meetings at first, after 1717 he withdrew because he did not speak English and was bored with the discussions. [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] (1727–1760) occasionally presided at Cabinet meetings but his grandson, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] (1760–1820), is known to have attended only two during his 60 year reign. Thus, the convention that Sovereigns do not attend Cabinet meetings was established primarily through royal indifference to the everyday tasks of governance. The Prime Minister became responsible for calling meetings, presiding, taking notes, and reporting to the Sovereign. These simple executive tasks naturally gave the Prime Minister ascendancy over his Cabinet colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the first three Hanoverians rarely attended Cabinet meetings they insisted on their prerogatives to appoint and dismiss ministers and to direct policy even if from outside the Cabinet. It was not until late in the 18th century that Prime Ministers gained control over Cabinet composition (see section [[#Emergence of Cabinet government|Emergence of Cabinet Government]] below).

===&quot;One Party Government&quot;===
British governments (or Ministries) are generally formed by one party. The Prime Minister and Cabinet are usually all members of the same political party, almost always the one that has a majority of seats in the House of Commons. Coalition governments (a ministry that consists of representatives from two or more parties) and minority governments (a one-party ministry formed by a party that does not command a majority in the Commons) are relatively rare. &quot;One party government&quot;, as this system is sometimes called, has been the general rule for almost three hundred years.

Early in his reign, [[William III of England|William III]] (1689–1702) preferred &quot;Mixed Ministries&quot; (or coalitions) consisting of both Tories and Whigs. William thought this composition would dilute the power of any one party and also give him the benefit of differing points of view. However, this approach did not work well because the members could not agree on a leader or on policies, and often worked at odds with each other.

In 1697, William formed a homogeneous Whig ministry. Known as the ''Junto'', this government is often cited as the first true Cabinet because its members were all Whigs, reflecting the majority composition of the Commons.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marriott|Marriott]], pages 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne (1702–1714) followed this pattern but preferred Tory Cabinets. This approach worked well as long as Parliament was also predominantly Tory. However, in 1708, when the Whigs obtained a majority, Anne did not call on them to form a government, refusing to accept the idea that politicians could force themselves on her merely because their party had a majority.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dodd|Dodd]], p.66 &quot;Is it not hard&quot; Anne said, &quot;that men of sense and honour will not promote the good of their country, because everything in the world is not done as they desire?&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; She never parted with an entire Ministry or accepted an entirely new one regardless of the results of an election. Anne preferred to retain a minority government rather than be dictated to by Parliament. Consequently, her chief ministers [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin]] and [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Robert Harley]], who were called &quot;Prime Minister&quot; by some, had difficulty executing policy in the face of a hostile Parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, pages 379–382&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marriott|Marriott]], p. 76–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

William's and Anne's experiments with the political composition of the Cabinet illustrated the strengths of one party government and the weaknesses of coalition and minority governments. Nevertheless, it was not until the 1830s that the constitutional convention was established that the Sovereign must select the Prime Minister (and Cabinet) from the party whose views reflect those of the majority in Parliament. Since then, most ministries have reflected this one party rule.

Despite the &quot;one party&quot; convention, Prime Ministers may still be called upon to lead either minority or coalition governments. A [[minority government]] may be formed as a result of a &quot;[[hung parliament]]&quot; in which no single party commands a majority in the House of Commons after a general election or the death, resignation or defection of existing members. By convention the serving Prime Minister is given first opportunity to reach agreements that will allow them to survive a vote of confidence in the House and continue to govern. The last minority government was led by Labour Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] for eight months after the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]] produced a hung parliament. In the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974 general election]], the Labour Party gained 18 seats, giving Wilson a majority of three.

A hung parliament may also lead to the formation of a [[coalition government]] in which two or more parties negotiate a joint programme to command a majority in the Commons. Coalitions have also been formed during times of national crisis such as war. Under this circumstance, the parties agree to temporarily set aside their political differences and unite to face the national crisis. Coalitions are rare; since 1721, there have been fewer than a dozen. When the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|general election of 2010]] produced a hung parliament, the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties agreed to form Her Majesty's current coalition government, the first in seventy years. The last Coalition in the UK before 2010 was led by Conservative Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] during most of the Second World War from May 1940 to May 1945. [[Clement Attlee]], the leader of the Labour Party, served as Deputy Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], p. 376–379.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treasury Commission===
The Premiership is still largely a convention of the constitution; its legal authority is derived primarily from the fact that the Prime Minister is also First Lord of the Treasury. The connection of these two offices&amp;nbsp;– one a convention, the other a legal office&amp;nbsp;– began with the Hanoverian Succession in 1714.

When George I succeeded to the British throne in 1714, his German ministers advised him to leave the office of [[Lord High Treasurer]] vacant because those who had held it in recent years had grown overly powerful, in effect, replacing the Sovereign as head of the government. They also feared that a Lord High Treasurer would undermine their own influence with the new King. They therefore suggested that he place the office in &quot;commission&quot;, meaning that a committee of five ministers would perform its functions together. Theoretically, this dilution of authority would prevent any one of them from presuming to be the head of the government. The King agreed and created the Treasury Commission consisting of the First Lord of the Treasury, the Second Lord, and three Junior Lords.

No one has been appointed Lord High Treasurer since 1714; it has remained in commission for three hundred years. The Treasury Commission ceased to meet late in the 18th century but has survived, albeit with very different functions: the First Lord of the Treasury is now the Prime Minister, the Second Lord is the Chancellor of the Exchequer (and actually in charge of the Treasury), and the Junior Lords are government Whips maintaining party discipline in the House of Commons; they no longer have any duties related to the Treasury, though when [[Delegated legislation in the United Kingdom|subordinate legislation]] requires the consent of the Treasury it is still two of the Junior Lords who sign on its behalf.&lt;ref group=note&gt;See e.g. the various orders prescribing fees to be taken in public offices&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marriott|Marriott]], p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Prime Ministers==
===&quot;First&quot; Prime Minister===
Since the office was not created, there is no &quot;first&quot; Prime Minister. However, the honorary appellation is traditionally given to Sir [[Robert Walpole]] who became First Lord of the Treasury in 1721. [[File:robertwalpole.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Portrait of Sir [[Robert Walpole]], studio of [[Jean-Baptiste van Loo]], 1740. Walpole is considered to have been the &quot;First&quot; Prime Minister.]]
In 1720, the [[South Sea Company]], created to trade in cotton, agricultural goods and slaves, collapsed, causing the financial ruin of thousands of investors and heavy losses for many others including members of the royal family. King George I called on Robert Walpole, well known for his political and financial acumen, to handle the emergency. With considerable skill{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} and some luck{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}, Walpole acted quickly to restore public credit and confidence, and led the country out of the crisis. A year later, the King appointed him First Lord of the Treasury, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Leader of the House of Commons making him the most powerful minister in the government. Ruthless, crude, and hard-working, he had a &quot;sagacious business sense&quot; and was a superb manager of men.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; At the head of affairs for the next two decades, Walpole stabilised the nation's finances, kept it at peace, made it prosperous, and secured the [[Hanoverian Succession]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pike|Pike]], pages 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Walpole demonstrated for the first time how a chief minister&amp;nbsp;– a Prime Minister&amp;nbsp;– could be the actual Head of the Government under the new constitutional framework. First, recognising that the Sovereign could no longer govern directly but was still the nominal head of the government, he insisted that he was nothing more than the &quot;King's Servant&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], p. 385. He worked tirelessly to maintain the King's confidence, and sometimes resorted to bribery. On the accession of George II in 1727, for example, Walpole gave the new King an additional £100,000 for his personal use to maintain his offices.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, recognising that power had shifted to the Commons, he conducted the nation's business there and made it dominant over the Lords in all matters. Third, recognising that the Cabinet had become the executive and must be united, he dominated the other members and demanded their complete support for his policies. Fourth, recognising that political parties were the source of ministerial strength, he led the Whig party and maintained discipline. In the Commons, he insisted on the support of all Whig members, especially those who held office. Finally, he set an example for future Prime Ministers by resigning his offices in 1742 after a vote of confidence, which he won by just 3 votes. This slim majority undermined his power even though he still retained the confidence of the Sovereign.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marriott|Marriott]], pages 77–81. The preceding paragraph is a paraphrase of Hearn's famous list of Walpole's contributions to the evolution of the office of Prime Minister in his book ''Government of England'', page 220, quoted by Marriott.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], pages 385–387&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ambivalence and denial===
For all his contributions, Walpole was not a Prime Minister in the modern sense. The King—not Parliament—chose him; and the King—not Walpole—chose the Cabinet. Walpole set an example, not a precedent, and few followed his example. For over 40 years after Walpole's fall in 1742, there was widespread ambivalence about the position. In some cases, the Prime Minister was a figurehead with power being wielded by other individuals; in others there was a reversion to the &quot;chief minister&quot; model of earlier times in which the Sovereign actually governed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marriott|Marriott]], p. 86. During most periods of British history, there have been Chief Ministers who have had many of the attributes of a modern Prime Minister such as [[Dunstan of Glastonbury]] under [[Edgar of England|Edgar]], [[Ralph Flambard]] under [[William II of England|William II]], [[Cardinal Wolsey]] and [[Thomas Cromwell]] under [[Henry VIII]], and many others.&lt;/ref&gt; At other times, there appeared to be two prime ministers.  During [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|Britain's participation in the Seven Years War]], for example, the powers of government were divided equally between the [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle]] and [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]], leading to them both alternatively being described as Prime Minister. Furthermore, many thought that the title &quot;Prime Minister&quot; usurped the Sovereign's constitutional position as &quot;head of the government&quot; and that it was an affront to other ministers because they were all appointed by and equally responsible to the Sovereign.

For these reasons there was a reluctance to use the title. Although Walpole is now called the &quot;first&quot; Prime Minister, the title was not commonly used during his tenure. Walpole himself denied it. In 1741, during the attack that led to Walpole's downfall, [[Samuel Sandys]] declared that &quot;According to our Constitution we can have no sole and prime minister.&quot; In his defence, Walpole said &quot;I unequivocally deny that I am sole or Prime Minister and that to my influence and direction all the affairs of government must be attributed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marriott, p. 88&quot;&gt;[[#Marriott|Marriott]], p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Grenville]], Prime Minister in the 1760s, said it was &quot;an odious title&quot; and never used it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Low|Low]], p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord North]], the reluctant head of the King's Government during the [[American War of Independence]], &quot;would never suffer himself to be called Prime Minister, because it was an office unknown to the Constitution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Low|Low]], pages 156–157&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The 18th-century ambivalence causes problems for researchers trying to identify who was a Prime Minister and who was not. Every list of Prime Ministers may omit certain politicians. For instance, unsuccessful attempts to form ministries—such as the two-day government formed by the [[William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath|Earl of Bath]] in 1746, often dismissed as the &quot;[[Short-lived Ministry|Silly Little Ministry]]&quot;—may be included in a list or omitted, depending on the criteria selected.&lt;/ref&gt;

Denials of the Premiership's legal existence continued throughout the 19th century. In 1806, for example, one member of the Commons said, &quot;the Constitution abhors the idea of a prime minister&quot;. In 1829, [[Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]] said, &quot;nothing could be more mischievous or unconstitutional than to recognise by act of parliament the existence of such an office.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Walpole|Walpole]], pp. 213–214&lt;/ref&gt;

By the turn of the 20th century the Premiership had become, by convention, the most important position in the constitutional hierarchy. Yet there were no legal documents describing its powers or acknowledging its existence. Incumbents had no statutory authority in their own right. As late as 1904, Arthur Balfour explained the status of his office in a speech at Haddington: &quot;The Prime Minister has no salary as Prime Minister. He has no statutory duties as Prime Minister, his name occurs in no Acts of Parliament, and though holding the most important place in the constitutional hierarchy, he has no place which is recognised by the laws of his country. This is a strange paradox.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Low|Low]], pp. 160-161 In his memoirs, ''Gleanings'', Gladstone lamented the Prime Ministry's unseemly status in the government hierarchy: &quot;Nowhere in the wide world,&quot; he said, &quot;does so great a substance cast so small a shadow. Nowhere is there a man who has so much power with so little to show for it in the way of formal title or prerogative.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905 the position was given some official recognition when the &quot;Prime Minister&quot; was named in the [[United Kingdom order of precedence|order of precedence]], outranked, among non-royals, only by the Archbishops of [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Canterbury]] and [[Archbishop of York|York]], the [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] and the [[Lord Chancellor]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marriott|Marriott]], p 85&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Act of Parliament—albeit in a schedule—to mention the Premiership was the [[Chequers Estate Act 1917|Chequers Estate Act]] on 20 December 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/talking_politics/88166.stm|title=UK Politics: Talking Politics&amp;nbsp;— Conventions of the constitution|last=Rozenberg|first=Joshua|date=3 June 1998|publisher=BBC News|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law conferred the [[Chequers]] Estate owned by [[Arthur Lee, 1st Viscount Lee of Fareham|Sir Arthur]] and Lady Lee, as a gift to the Crown for use as a country home for future Prime Ministers.

Unequivocal legal recognition was given in the [[Ministers of the Crown Act 1937]], which made provision for paying a salary to the person who is both &quot;the First Lord of the Treasury and Prime Minister&quot;. Explicitly recognising two hundred years' of ambivalence, the act states that it intended &quot;To give statutory recognition to the existence of the position of Prime Minister, and to the historic link between the Premiership and the office of First Lord of the Treasury, by providing in respect to that position and office a salary of ...&quot; The Act made a distinction between the &quot;position&quot; (Prime Minister) and the &quot;office&quot; (First Lord of the Treasury), emphasising the unique political character of the former. Nevertheless, the brass plate on the door of the Prime Minister's home, [[10 Downing Street]], still bears the title of &quot;First Lord of the Treasury&quot;, as it has since the 18th century.

==&quot;First among equals&quot;==
===Emergence of Cabinet government=== &lt;!-- This section is linked to from the section &quot;Foundations of the office of Prime Minister &gt; Cabinet&quot;, above. --&gt;
Despite the reluctance to legally recognise the Premiership, ambivalence toward it waned in the 1780s. As noted previously, George III (1760–1820) is known to have attended only two Cabinet meetings. However, during the first twenty years of his reign, he tried to be his own &quot;prime minister&quot; by controlling policy from outside the Cabinet, appointing and dismissing ministers, meeting privately with individual ministers, and giving them instructions. These practices caused confusion and dissension in Cabinet meetings, especially during the dysfunctional ministries of [[William Pitt the Elder|the Earl of Chatham]] from 1766–1768 and of the [[Augustus Henry FitzRoy|Duke of Grafton]] from 1768-1770 when no one, not even the King, seemed to be in charge.&lt;ref&gt;see [[#Tuchman2|Tuchman]], ''The March of Folly'', pp 127-232 for detailed descriptions of these and other ministries between the years 1760 and 1782&lt;/ref&gt;

After the failure of [[Lord North]]'s ministry (1770–1782) in March 1782 due to Britain's defeat in the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the ensuing [[vote of no confidence]] by Parliament, the [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Marquess of Rockingham]] reasserted the Prime Minister's control over the Cabinet. Rockingham assumed the Premiership &quot;on the distinct understanding that measures were to be changed as well as men; and that the measures for which the new ministry required the royal consent were the measures which they, while in opposition, had advocated.&quot; He and his Cabinet were united in their policies and would stand or fall together; they also refused to accept anyone in the Cabinet who did not agree.&lt;ref group=note&gt;This event also marks the beginnings of collective Cabinet responsibility. This principle states that the decisions made by any one Cabinet member become the responsibility of the entire Cabinet.&lt;/ref&gt; King George threatened to [[abdicate]] but in the end reluctantly agreed out of necessity: he had to have a government.

From this time, there was a growing acceptance of the position of Prime Minister and the title was more commonly used, if only unofficially.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, pages 379–382&quot;&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], pages 379–382.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Low|Low]], pp. 141-142.&lt;/ref&gt; Associated initially with the Whigs, even the Tories started to accept it. Lord North, for example, who had said the office was &quot;unknown to the constitution&quot;, reversed himself in 1783 when he said, &quot;In this country some one man or some body of men like a Cabinet should govern the whole and direct every measure.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dodd|Dodd]], p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pares, p. 175 In a letter to the King written at the same time, North repeated the idea, &quot;That in critical times, it is necessary that there should be one directing Minister, who should plan the whole of the operations of government, so far as to make them co-operate zealously &amp; actively with his designs even tho' contrary to their own.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1803, [[William Pitt the Younger]], also a Tory, suggested to a friend that &quot;this person generally called the first minister&quot; was an absolute necessity for a government to function, and expressed his belief that this person should be the minister in charge of the finances.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marriott, p. 88&quot;/&gt;
[[File:William Pitt the Younger at Westminster.gif|thumb|200px|right|''William Pitt the Younger in front of the Treasury Bench addressing the House of Commons.'' Pitt's 19 year ministry followed by Lord Liverpool's 15, led the Tory Party to accept the office of Prime Minister as a convention of the constitution.]]

The Tories' wholesale conversion started when Pitt was confirmed as Prime Minister in the election of 1784. For the next 17 years until 1801 (and again from 1804 to 1806), Pitt, the Tory, was Prime Minister in the same sense that Walpole, the Whig, had been earlier.

Their conversion was reinforced after 1810. In that year, George III, who had suffered periodically from mental instability (due to a blood disorder now known as [[porphyria]]), became permanently insane and spent the remaining 10 years of his life unable to discharge his duties. The [[Prince Regent]] was prevented from using the full powers of Kingship. The Regent became [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] in 1820, but during his 10 year reign was indolent and frivolous. Consequently, for 20 years the throne was virtually vacant and Tory Cabinets led by Tory Prime Ministers filled the void, governing virtually on their own.

The Tories were in power for almost 50 years, except for a short Whig ministry from 1806 to 1807. [[Lord Liverpool]] was Prime Minister for 15 years; he and Pitt held the position for 34 years. Under their long, consistent leadership, Cabinet government became a convention of the constitution. Although subtle issues remained to be settled, the [[Cabinet Government|Cabinet system of government]] is essentially the same today as it was in 1830.

Under this form of government, called the [[Westminster System]], the Sovereign is [[Head of State]] and titular head of [[Her Majesty's Government]]. She selects as her Prime Minister the person who is able to command a working majority in the House of Commons, and invites him to form a government. As the actual [[Head of Government]], the Prime Minister selects his Cabinet, choosing its members from among those in Parliament who agree or generally agree with his intended policies. He then recommends them to the Sovereign who confirms his selections by formally appointing them to their respective offices. Led by the Prime Minister, the Cabinet is collectively responsible for everything the government does. The Sovereign does not confer with its members privately about policy or attend its meetings. With respect to ''actual'' governance, the monarch has only three constitutional rights: to be kept informed, to advise, and to warn.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marriott|Marriott]], pp 92-93 Bagehot enumerated the three rights of a constitutional Monarch as &quot;the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In practice this means that the Sovereign reviews state papers and meets regularly with the Prime Minister, usually weekly, when she may advise and warn him regarding the proposed decisions and actions of Her Government.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marriott|Marriott]], pp 78-83. Marriott enumerates five characteristics of modern Cabinet Government: 1. exclusion of the Sovereign, 2. close correspondence of party affiliation between the Cabinet and the majority in Parliament, 3. homogeneity of the Cabinet, 4. collective responsibility, and 5. ascendency of the Prime Minister.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loyal Opposition===
The modern British system includes not only a government formed by the majority party (or coalition of parties) in the House of Commons but also an organised and open opposition formed by those who are not members of the governing party. Called the [[Loyal Opposition]] (or &quot;Her Majesty's Opposition&quot;), they occupy the benches to the Speaker's left. Seated in the front, directly across from the ministers on the Treasury Bench, the leaders of the opposition form a &quot;Shadow Government&quot;, complete with a salaried &quot;Shadow Prime Minister&quot;, the [[Leader of the Opposition]], ready to assume office if the government falls or loses the next election.

[[File:House of Commons Microcosm.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''The House of Commons early 19th century.'' The Loyal Opposition occupy the benches to the Speaker's left. Seated in the front, the leaders of the opposition form a &quot;Shadow Government&quot;, complete with a salaried &quot;Shadow Prime Minister&quot; ready to assume office if the government falls or loses the next election.]]

Opposing the King's government was considered disloyal, even treasonous, at the end of the 17th century. During the 18th century this idea waned and finally disappeared as the two party system developed. The expression &quot;His Majesty's Opposition&quot; was coined by [[John Cam Hobhouse]], Lord Broughton. In 1826, Broughton, a Whig, announced in the Commons that he opposed the report of a Bill. As a joke, he said, &quot;It was said to be very hard on His Majesty's ministers to raise objections to this proposition. For my part, I think it is much more hard on His Majesty's Opposition to compel them to take this course.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Foord|Foord]], p.1 Laughter followed Hobhouse's remark but George Tierney, a leading Whig, repeated the phrase and added a definition. &quot;My honourable friend,&quot; he said, &quot;could not have invented a better phrase to designate us than that which he has adopted, for we are certainly to all intents and purposes a branch of His Majesty's Government.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase caught on and has been used ever since. Sometimes translated as the &quot;[[Loyal Opposition]]&quot;, it acknowledges the legitimate existence of the two party system, and describes an important constitutional concept: opposing the government is not treason; reasonable men can honestly oppose its policies and still be loyal to the Sovereign and the nation.

Informally recognised for over a century as a convention of the constitution, the position of Leader of the Opposition was given statutory recognition in 1937 by the [[Ministers of the Crown Act 1937|Ministers of the Crown Act]].

===Great Reform Bill and the Premiership===
British Prime Ministers have never been elected directly by the public. They have all become Prime Minister indirectly because firstly, they were members of either the Commons or Lords; secondly, they were the leader of a great political party; and, thirdly, they either inherited a majority in the Commons, or won more seats than the opposition in a general election.

[[File:Charles Grey - 2nd Earl Grey - atop the Grey Momument - Newcastle upon Tyne - England - 140804.jpg|thumbnail|200px|Lord Grey, often called the first modern Prime Minister]]
[[File:Inscription Grey Monument.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Inscription on Grey Monument, Newcastle upon Tyne, England (click image to enlarge)]]

Since 1722, most Prime Ministers have been members of the Commons; since 1902, all have had a seat there.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Except [[Alec Douglas-Home|Lord Home]], who resigned his peerage to stand in a by-election soon after becoming Prime Minister&lt;/ref&gt; Like other members, they are elected initially to represent only a constituency. Former Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], for example, represented [[Sedgefield (UK Parliament constituency)|Sedgefield]] in County Durham from 1983 to 2007. He became Prime Minister because in 1994 he was elected Labour Party leader and then led the party to victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], winning 418 seats compared to 165 for the Conservatives and gaining a majority in the House of Commons.

Neither the Sovereign nor the [[House of Lords]] had any meaningful influence over who was elected to the Commons in 1997 or in deciding whether or not Blair would become Prime Minister. Their detachment from the electoral process and the selection of the Prime Minister has been a convention of the constitution for almost 200 years.

Prior to the 19th century, however, they had significant influence, using to their advantage the fact that most citizens were disenfranchised and seats in the Commons were allocated disproportionately. The system was based on legislation passed in 1429 and virtually unchanged for 400 years.&lt;ref&gt;Maitland, p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], pages 234–235.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1832, only 440,000 met the voter qualifications in a population of 17&amp;nbsp;million. Although populations shifted, representation in the Commons remained the same. Consequently, some constituencies were over-represented; others under-represented. Through patronage, corruption and bribery, the Crown and Lords &quot;owned&quot; about 30% of the seats (called &quot;pocket&quot; or &quot;rotten boroughs&quot;) giving them a significant influence in the Commons and in the selection of the Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], pages 37–38,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marriott|Marriott]], pages 219–222.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1830, [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Charles Grey]], a life-long Whig, became Prime Minister determined to reform the electoral system. For two years, he and his Cabinet (including four future Prime Ministers&amp;nbsp;– [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Melbourne]], [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Russell]], [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Palmerston]] and [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Derby]]&amp;nbsp;– and one former one, [[Frederick John Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich|Goderich]]) fought to pass what has come to be known as the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Bill of 1832]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pike|Pike]], pages 188–194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minney, p. 216. These are two of the most exciting years in all of Parliamentary history, filled with drama and a sense that history was being made. Lord Creevey, for example, recorded in his diary, &quot;I dined in Downing Street with Lady Grey.... After dinner the private secretary to the Prime Minister and myself being alone, I ascertained that although Lord Grey was gone to Brighton ostensibly to prick for Sheriffs for the year, his great object was to put his plan of reform before the King, previous... to its being proposed to the House of Commons. A ticklish operation, this! to propose to a Sovereign a plan for reducing his own power and patronage. However, there is the plan all cut and dry, and the Cabinet unanimous upon it.... Grey is determined to fight it out to a dissolution of Parliament, if his plan is beat in the Commons. My eye, what a crisis!&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatness of the Great Reform Bill lay less in substance than symbolism. As John Bright, the liberal statesman of the next generation, said, &quot;It was not a good Bill, but it was a great Bill when it passed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan, p.272.&lt;/ref&gt;

Substantively, it increased the franchise 65% to 717,000 with the middle class receiving most of the new votes. The representation of 56 rotten boroughs was eliminated completely and half the representation of 30 others; the freed up seats were distributed to boroughs created for previously disenfranchised areas. However, many rotten boroughs remained and it still excluded millions of working class men and all women.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marriott|Marriott]], pages 222–223.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], pages 437–444.&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolically, the Bill exceeded expectations and is now ranked with [[Magna Carta]] and the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] as one of the most important documents of the British constitutional tradition.

First, the Great Reform Bill removed the Sovereign from the election process and the choice of Prime Minister. Slowly evolving for 100 years, this convention was confirmed two years after the passage of the bill. In 1834 [[King William IV]] dismissed Melbourne as Premier, but was forced to recall him when [[Robert Peel]], the King's choice, could not form a working majority. Since then, no Sovereign has tried to impose a Prime Minister on Parliament.

Second, the Bill reduced the Lords' power by eliminating many of their pocket boroughs and creating new ones where they had no influence. Weakened, they were unable to prevent the passage of more comprehensive electoral reforms in 1867, 1884, 1918 and 1928 when universal equal suffrage was achieved.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], pages 454, 468, 486, and 489.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:PunchDizzyReformBill.png|thumb|180px|left|''Disraeli and Gladstone Race to Pass the Reform Bill, Punch, 1867'' The rivalry between Disraeli and Gladstone helped to identify the position of Prime Minister with specific personalities. (Disraeli is in the lead looking back over his shoulder at Gladstone.)]] Ultimately, this erosion of power led to the Parliament Act of 1911 that marginalised the Lords' role in the legislative process and to the convention that a Prime Minister cannot sit in the House of Lords. The last to do so was [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury]], from 1895 to 1902.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The last Prime Minister to be a member of the Lords during any part of his tenure was [[Alec Douglas-Home, 14th Earl of Home]] in 1963. Lord Home was the last Prime Minister who was a hereditary peer, but, within days of attaining office, he disclaimed his peerage, abiding by the convention that the Prime Minister should sit in the House of Commons. A junior member of his Conservative Party who had already been selected as candidate in a [[Kinross and West Perthshire by-election, 1963|by-election]] in a staunch Conservative seat stood aside, allowing Home to contest the by-election, win and thus procure a seat in the lower House.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grey's bearing changed the Premiership. Often called the first &quot;modern Prime Minister&quot;, he set both an example and a precedent for his successors. He was ''primus inter pares'', &quot;first among equals&quot;, as Bagehot said in 1867 of the Prime Minister's status. Using his Whig victory as a mandate for reform, Grey was unrelenting in the pursuit of this goal, using every Parliamentary device to achieve it. Although respectful toward the King, he made it clear that his constitutional duty was to acquiesce to the will of the people and Parliament.

The Loyal Opposition acquiesced too. Some disgruntled Tories claimed they would repeal the Bill once they regained a majority. But in 1834, Robert Peel, the new Conservative leader, put an end to this threat when he stated in his [[Tamworth Manifesto]] that the Bill was &quot;a final and irrevocable settlement of a great constitutional question which no friend to the peace and welfare of this country would attempt to disturb&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pike|Pike]], p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Peel affirmed a convention of the constitution that promotes stability in the British system: the Parliament of the day must respect the settlement of constitutional issues made by previous Parliaments.

===Populist Prime Ministers===
[[File:Elliott &amp; Fry10a.jpg|thumb|200|right|Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]] cultivated the public image as a ''man of the people'' by circulating pictures like this of himself cutting down oak trees with an axe.]]

The Premiership was a reclusive office prior to 1832. The incumbent worked with his Cabinet and other government officials; he occasionally met with the Sovereign, and attended Parliament when it was in session during the spring and summer. He never went out on the stump to campaign, even during elections; he rarely spoke directly to ordinary voters about policies and issues.

After the passage of the [[Great Reform Bill]], the nature of the position changed; Prime Ministers had to go out among the people. The Bill increased the electorate to 717,000. Subsequent legislation (and population growth) raised it to 2&amp;nbsp;million in 1867, 5.5&amp;nbsp;million in 1884 and 21.4&amp;nbsp;million in 1918. As the franchise increased, power shifted to the people and Prime Ministers assumed more responsibilities with respect to party leadership. It naturally fell on them to motivate and organise their followers, explain party policies, and deliver its &quot;message&quot;. Successful leaders had to have a new set of skills: to give a good speech, present a favourable image, and interact with a crowd. They became the &quot;voice&quot;, the “face” and the &quot;image&quot; of the party and ministry.

[[File:Victoria Disraeli cartoon.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] cultivated a public image as an Imperialist with grand gestures such as conferring on [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]] the title “Empress of India”.]]

Robert Peel, often called the &quot;model Prime Minister&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Rosebery, p. 27. Lord Rosebery, later a Prime Minister himself, said of Peel: &quot;the model of all Prime Ministers. It is more than doubtful, indeed, if it be possible in this generation, when the burdens of Empire and of office have so incalculably grown, for any Prime Minister to discharge the duties of his high office with the same thoroughness or in the same spirit as Peel . . . Peel kept a strict supervision over every department: he seems to have been master of the business of each and all of them . . . it is probable that no Prime Minister ever fulfilled so completely and thoroughly the functions of the office, parliamentary, administrative, and general as Sir Robert Peel.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; was the first to recognise this new role. After the successful Conservative campaign of 1841, J. W. Croker said in a letter to Peel, &quot;The elections are wonderful, and the curiosity is that all turns on the name of Sir Robert Peel. 'It's the first time that I remember in our history that the people have chosen the first Minister for the Sovereign. Mr. Pitt's case in '84 is the nearest analogy; but then the people only confirmed the Sovereign's choice; here every Conservative candidate professed himself in plain words to be Sir Robert Peel's man, and on that ground was elected.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hanham, pages 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benjamin Disraeli]] and [[William Ewart Gladstone]] developed this new role further by projecting &quot;images&quot; of themselves to the public. Known by their nicknames &quot;Dizzy&quot; and the &quot;Grand Old Man&quot;, their colourful, sometimes bitter, personal and political rivalry over the issues of their time&amp;nbsp;– Imperialism vs. Anti-Imperialism, expansion of the franchise, labour reform, and Irish Home Rule&amp;nbsp;– spanned almost twenty years until Disraeli's death in 1881.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Even after death their rivalry continued. When Disraeli died in 1881, Gladstone proposed a state funeral, but Disraeli's will specified that he have a private funeral and be buried next to his wife. Gladstone replied, &quot;As [Disraeli] lived, so he died&amp;nbsp;— all display, without reality or genuineness.&quot; Disraeli, for his part, once said that GOM (the acronym for &quot;Grand Old Man&quot;), really stood for &quot;God's Only Mistake&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Documented by the penny press, photographs and political cartoons, their rivalry linked specific personalities with the Premiership in the public mind and further enhanced its status.

[[File:GladstoneandRosebery.gif|thumb|200px|right|''Gladstone During the Midlothian Campaign 1879'' Speaking directly to the people for the first time, Gladstone's Midlothian campaign symbolises a major change in the role of the Prime Minister. (Gladstone is seated in the centre; Rosebery, a future Prime Minister, is sitting on the carpet in front.)]]

Each created a different public image of himself and his party. Disraeli, who expanded the Empire to protect British interests abroad, cultivated the image of himself (and the Conservative Party) as &quot;Imperialist&quot;, making grand gestures such as conferring the title &quot;Empress of India&quot; on Queen Victoria in 1876. Gladstone, who saw little value in the Empire, proposed an anti-Imperialist policy (later called &quot;Little England&quot;), and cultivated the image of himself (and the Liberal Party) as &quot;man of the people&quot; by circulating pictures of himself cutting down great oak trees with an axe as a hobby.

Gladstone went beyond image by appealing directly to the people. In his [[Midlothian Campaign]]&amp;nbsp;– so called because he stood as a candidate for that county&amp;nbsp;– Gladstone spoke in fields, halls and railway stations to hundreds, sometimes thousands, of students, farmers, labourers and middle class workers. Although not the first leader to speak directly to voters&amp;nbsp;– both he and Disraeli had spoken directly to party loyalists before on special occasions&amp;nbsp;– he was the first to canvass an entire constituency delivering his message to anyone who would listen, encouraging his supporters and trying to convert his opponents. Publicised nationwide, Gladstone's message became that of the party. Noting its significance, [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]] said, &quot;It is a new thing and a very serious thing to see the Prime Minister on the stump.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bigham, p. 318. Disraeli and Victoria thought the tactic was unconstitutional. &quot;Such conduct&quot;, the Queen said, &quot;is unheard of and the only excuse is&amp;nbsp;– that he is not quite sane.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Campaigning directly to the people became commonplace. Several 20th century Prime Ministers, such as [[David Lloyd George]] and [[Winston Churchill]], were famous for their oratorical skills. After the introduction of radio, motion pictures, television, and the internet, many used these technologies to project their public image and address the nation. [[Stanley Baldwin]], a master of the radio broadcast in the 1920s and 1930s, reached a national audience in his talks filled with homely advice and simple expressions of national pride.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pike|Pike]], p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] also used the radio to great effect, inspiring, reassuring and informing the people with his speeches during the Second World War. Two recent Prime Ministers, [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Tony Blair]], achieved celebrity status, like rock stars but have been criticised for their more 'presidential' style of leadership.. According to [[Anthony King (professor)|Anthony King]], &quot;&quot;The props in Blair's theatre of celebrity included ... his guitar, his casual clothes ... footballs bounced skilfully off the top of his head ... and carefully choreographed speeches-cum-performances at Labour Party conferences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#King|King]], pages 319–320.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Premiership==
===Parliament Act and the Premiership===
In addition to being the leader of a great political party and the head of Her Majesty's Government, the modern Prime Minister is the leader of the House of Commons. From this commanding position, the Prime Minister directs the law-making process, enacting into law his party’s programme. For example, Tony Blair, whose Labour party was elected in 1997 partly on a promise to enact a British Bill of Rights and to create devolved governments for Scotland and Wales, subsequently stewarded through Parliament the Human Rights Act (1998), the Scotland Act (1998) and the Government of Wales Act (1998).

From its appearance in the 14th century Parliament has been a bicameral legislature consisting of the Commons and the Lords. Members of the Commons are elected; those in the Lords are not. Most Lords are called &quot;Temporal&quot; with titles such as Duke, Marquess, Earl and Viscount. The balance are Lords Spiritual (prelates of the Anglican Church).

For most of the history of the Upper House, Lords Temporal were land owners who held their estates, titles and seats as an hereditary right passed down from one generation to the next in some cases for centuries. In 1910, for example, there were nineteen whose title was created before 1500.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tuchman1|Tuchman]], p 391&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Following a series of reforms in the 20th century the Lords now consists almost entirely of appointed members who hold their title only for their own lifetime. As of July 2008 the Lords had 746 members, compared to 646 in the Commons.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lords_composition&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/directories/house_of_lords_information_office/analysis_by_composition.cfm |title=House of Lords: Breakdown of Lords by party strength and type of peerage |accessdate=25 May 2008 |date=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/directories/hcio/stateparties.cfm |title=House of Commons: State of the parties |accessdate=25 May 2008|date=23 May 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080511151016/http://www.parliament.uk/directories/hcio/stateparties.cfm |archivedate = 11 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1911, Prime Ministers had to guide legislation through the Commons and the Lords and obtain a majority approval in both to translate it into law. This was not always easy because political differences usually separated the chambers. Representing the landed aristocracy, Lords Temporal were generally Tory (later Conservative) who wanted to maintain the status quo and resisted progressive measures such as extending the franchise. The party affiliation of members of the Commons was less predictable. During the 18th century its makeup varied because the Lords had considerable control over elections: sometimes Whigs dominated it, sometimes Tories. After the passage of the Great Reform Bill in 1832, the Commons gradually became more progressive, a tendency that increased with the passage of each subsequent expansion of the franchise.

[[File:Meeting of Asquith cabinet19090001.jpg|250px|thumb|right| ''Asquith's Cabinet Reacts to the Lords' Rejection of the &quot;People's Budget&quot;—a satirical cartoon, 1909'' Prime Minister Asquith's government welcomed the Lords' veto of the &quot;People's Budget&quot;; it moved the country toward a constitutional crisis over the Lords' legislative powers. (Asquith makes the announcement while David Lloyd George holds down a jubilant Winston Churchill.)]]

In 1906, the Liberal party, led by Sir [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]], won an overwhelming victory on a platform that promised social reforms for the working class. With 379 seats compared to the Conservatives' 132, the Liberals could confidently expect to pass their legislative programme through the Commons.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], p. 477,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tuchman1|Tuchman]], p 365. The Liberal majority was actually much larger in practice because on most issues they could rely on the votes of 51 Labour and Lib-Lab representatives and 83 Irish Nationalists. Their majority was so large and unprecedented&amp;nbsp;— they had more seats than all other parties combined&amp;nbsp;— that one Conservative called it a &quot;hideous abnormality&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, however, the Conservative Party had a huge majority in the Lords; it could easily veto any legislation passed by the Commons that was against their interests.&lt;ref&gt;Furthermore, [[Arthur Balfour]], the defeated Conservative Prime Minister and now Leader of the Opposition, declared that the House of Lords was the &quot;watchdog of the constitution&quot;; it had an obligation to promote stability by rejecting &quot;radical&quot; legislation proposed by &quot;zealots&quot; who may have a temporary numerical advantage in the Commons. [[David Lloyd George]], the new Liberal [[President of the Board of Trade]] and a future Prime Minister, said the Lords &quot;. . . is not the watchdog of the British Constitution. It is Mr Balfour's poodle!&quot; [[#Smith|Smith]], p. 478&lt;/ref&gt;

For five years, the Commons and the Lords fought over one bill after another. The Liberals pushed through parts of their programme, but the Conservatives vetoed or modified others. When the Lords vetoed the &quot;People's Budget&quot; in 1909, the controversy moved almost inevitably toward a constitutional crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], pp 478-480. Although the Liberals did pass the [[Trade Disputes Act 1906|Trade Disputes Act]], the [[Workmen's Compensation Act 1906|Workmen's Compensation Act]], the [[Labour Exchanges Act 1909|Labour Exchanges Act]], the [[Trade Boards Act 1909|Trade Boards Act]], and the [[Housing and Town Planning Act 1909|Housing and Town Planning Act]], the Lords vetoed an [[Education Bill]], a land reform bill, a [[Licensing Bill]], and a Plural Voting Bill; they mutilated and mauled an [[Agricultural Holdings Bill]] and an Irish Town Tenants Bill, and they almost rejected the [[Old Age Pensions Act 1908|Old Age Pensions Act]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Passing of the Parliament Bill, 1911 - Project Gutenberg eText 19609.jpg|250px|thumb|left| ''An important vote: the [[House of Lords]] voting for the [[Parliament Act 1911]]. From the Drawing by S. Begg'' The Parliament Act 1911 eliminated the Lords’ veto power over legislation approved by the House of Commons. Indirectly, it also further enhanced the dominance of the Prime Minister in the constitutional hierarchy.]]

In 1910, Prime Minister [[Herbert Asquith]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;Campbell-Bannerman retired and died in 1908&lt;/ref&gt; introduced a bill &quot;for regulating the relations between the Houses of Parliament&quot; which would eliminate the Lords' veto power over legislation. Passed by the Commons, the Lords rejected it. In a general election fought on this issue, the Liberals were weakened but still had a comfortable majority. At Asquith's request, King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] then threatened to create a sufficient number of new Liberal Peers to ensure the bill's passage. Rather than accept a permanent Liberal majority, the Conservative Lords yielded, and the bill became law.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Knappen|Knappen]], pp 554-555&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Parliament Act 1911]] established the supremacy of the Commons. It provided that the Lords could not delay for more than one month any bill certified by the Speaker of the Commons as a money bill. Furthermore, the act provided that any bill rejected by the Lords would nevertheless become law if passed by the Commons in three successive sessions provided that two years had elapsed since its original passage. The Lords could still delay or suspend the enactment of legislation but could no longer veto it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], p. 482,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Knappen|Knappen]], p. 555&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently the Lords “suspending” power was reduced to one year by the [[Parliament Act 1949]].

Indirectly, the Act enhanced the already dominant position of Prime Minister in the constitutional hierarchy. Although the Lords are still involved in the legislative process and the Prime Minister must still guide legislation through both Houses, the Lords no longer have the power to veto or even delay enactment of legislation passed by the Commons. Provided that he controls the Cabinet, maintains party discipline, and commands a majority in the Commons, the Prime Minister is assured of putting through his legislative agenda.

===&quot;Presidential&quot; Premiership===
The role and power of the Prime Minister have been subject to much change in the last fifty years. There has gradually been a change from Cabinet decision making and deliberation to the dominance of the Prime Minister. As early as 1965, in a new introduction to [[Walter Bagehot]]'s classic work ''[[The English Constitution]]'', [[Richard Crossman]] identified a new era of &quot;Prime Ministerial&quot; government. Some commentators, such as the political scientist Michael Foley, have argued there is a ''de facto'' &quot;British Presidency&quot;. In Tony Blair's government, many sources such as former ministers have suggested that decision-making was centred around him and Gordon Brown, and the Cabinet was no longer used for decision making.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 12 Blair's Cabinet: Monarchy Returns, British Government in Crisis, Christopher Foster, Hart Publishing, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Former ministers such as [[Clare Short]] and [[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury|Chris Smith]] have criticised the lack of decision-making power in Cabinet. When she resigned, Short denounced &quot;the centralisation of power into the hands of the Prime Minister and an increasingly small number of advisers&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3019871.stm |title=Short launches broadside on Blair |publisher=BBC News |date=12 May 2003 |accessdate=23 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Butler Review]] of 2004 condemned Blair's style of &quot;sofa government&quot;. [[File:Churchill waves to crowds.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Churchill waves to the Crowds After Announcing the Surrender of Germany 1945'']]

Prime Ministers may dominate the Cabinet so much that they become &quot;Semi-Presidents&quot;. Examples include [[William Ewart Gladstone]], [[David Lloyd George]], [[Neville Chamberlain]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], and [[Tony Blair]]. The powers of some Prime Ministers waxed or waned, depending upon their own level of energy, political skills or outside events: [[Ramsay MacDonald]], for example, was dominant in his Labour governments, but during his [[UK National Government|National Government]] his powers diminished so that he was merely the figurehead of the government. In modern times, Prime Ministers have never been merely titular; dominant or somewhat dominant personalities are the norm.

Generally, however, the Prime Minister is held responsible by the nation for the consequences of legislation or of general government policy – indeed, this heavy burden has pictured as ageing Prime Ministers at two or three times the normal rate. Margaret Thatcher's party forced her from power after the introduction of the [[community charge|poll tax]]; [[Anthony Eden|Sir Anthony Eden]] fell from power following the [[Suez Crisis]]; and Neville Chamberlain resigned in 1940 after the Allies were forced to retreat from Norway, as he believed a government supported by all parties was essential, and the Labour and Liberal parties would not join a government headed by him.

The Prime Minister's powers are also limited by the House of Commons, whose support the Government is obliged to maintain. The Commons checks the powers of the Prime Minister through committee hearings and through [[Question Time]], a weekly occurrence in which the Prime Minister is obliged to respond to the questions of the Leader of the Opposition and other members of the House. In practice, however, a Government with a strong majority need rarely fear &quot;backbench rebellions&quot;.

===Powers and constraints===
When commissioned by the Sovereign, a potential Prime Minister's first requisite is to &quot;form a Government&quot;&amp;nbsp;– create a cabinet of ministry that has the support of the House of Commons, of which they are expected to be a member. The Prime Minister then formally kisses the hands of his Sovereign, whose royal prerogative is thereafter exercised solely on the advice of the Prime Minister and Her Majesty's Government (&quot;HMG&quot;). The Prime Minister has weekly audiences with the Sovereign, whose functions are constitutionally limited &quot;to advise, to be consulted, and to warn&quot;; the extent of the Sovereign's ability to influence the nature of the Prime Ministerial advice is unknown, but presumably varies depending upon the personal relationship between the Sovereign and the Prime Minister of the day.

The Prime Minister will appoint all other cabinet members (who then become active Privy Counsellors) and ministers, although consulting senior ministers on their junior ministers, without any Parliamentary or other control or process over these powers. At any time, he may obtain the appointment, dismissal or nominal resignation of any other minister; he may resign, either purely personally or with his whole government.  The Prime Minister generally co-ordinates the policies and activities of the Cabinet and Government departments, acting as the main public &quot;face&quot; of Her Majesty's Government.

Although the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[British Armed Forces]] is legally the Sovereign, under constitutional practice the Prime Minister, with the Secretary of State for Defence whom he may appoint or dismiss, holds power over the deployment and disposition of British forces, and the declaration of war. The Prime Minister can authorise, but not directly order, the use of Britain's [[Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|nuclear weapons]] and the Prime Minister is hence a Commander-in-Chief in all but name.

The Prime Minister makes all the most senior Crown appointments, and most others are made by Ministers over whom he has the power of appointment and dismissal. [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellors]], [[Ambassador]]s and [[High Commissioner]]s, senior civil servants, senior military officers, members of important committees and commissions, and other officials are selected, and in most cases may be removed, by the Prime Minister. He also formally advises the Sovereign on the appointment of Archbishops and Bishops of the [[Church of England]], but his discretion is limited by the existence of the [[Crown Nominations Commission]]. The appointment of senior judges, while constitutionally still on the advice of the Prime Minister, is now made on the basis of recommendations from independent bodies.

Peerages, knighthoods, and other honours are bestowed by the Sovereign only on the advice of the Prime Minister. The only important British honours over which the Prime Minister does not have control are the Orders of the [[Order of the Garter|Garter]], [[Order of the Thistle|Thistle]], and [[Order of Merit|Merit]]; the [[Royal Victorian Order]]; and the [[Venerable Order of Saint John]], which are all within the &quot;personal gift&quot; of the Sovereign.

The Prime Minister appoints Ministers known as the &quot;Whips&quot;, who use his patronage to negotiate for the support of MPs and to discipline dissenters of the government parliamentary party. Party discipline is strong since electors generally vote for parties rather than individuals. Members of Parliament may be expelled from their party for failing to support the Government on important issues, and although this will not mean they must resign as MPs, it will usually make re-election difficult. Members of Parliament who hold ministerial office or political privileges can expect removal for failing to support the Prime Minister. Restraints imposed by the Commons grow weaker when the Government's party enjoys a large majority in that House, or in the electorate. In general, however, the Prime Minister and their colleagues may secure the Commons' support for almost any bill by internal party negotiations with little regard to opposition MPs.

However, even a government with a healthy majority can on occasion find itself unable to pass legislation. For example, on 31 January 2006, Tony Blair's Government was defeated over certain aspects of proposals to outlaw religious hatred, and, on 9 November 2005, was defeated over plans which would have allowed police to detain terror suspects for up to 90 days without charge. On other occasions, the Government alters its proposals in order to avoid defeat in the Commons, as Tony Blair's Government did in February 2006 over education reforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;education reforms&quot;&gt;{{

Formerly, a Prime Minister whose government lost a Commons vote would be regarded as fatally weakened, and his whole government would resign, usually precipitating a general election. In modern practice, when the Government party has an absolute majority in the House, only the express vote &quot;that this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government&quot; is treated as having this effect; dissentients on a minor issue within the majority party are unlikely to force an election with the probable loss of their seats and salaries, and any future in the party.

Likewise, a Prime Minister is no longer just &quot;first amongst equals&quot; in HM Government; although theoretically his Cabinet might still outvote him, in practice he progressively entrenches his position by retaining only personal supporters in the Cabinet. In periodical reshuffles, the Prime Minister can sideline and simply drop from Cabinet the Members who have fallen out of favour: they remain Privy Counsellors, but the Prime Minister decides which of them are summoned to meetings. The Prime Minister is responsible for producing and enforcing the [[Ministerial Code]].

==Precedence, privileges and form of address==
[[File:Blair Cheney at Number 10.jpg|thumb|140px|right|Tony Blair and [[Dick Cheney]] at the main door to 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister's residence in London, on 11 March 2002]]
By tradition, before a new Prime Minister can enter [[10 Downing Street]] for the first time as its occupant, they are required to announce to the country and the world that they have '[[Kissing hands|kissed hands]]' with the reigning monarch, and thus have become Prime Minister. This is usually done by saying words to the effect of:

{{quote|Her Majesty the Queen ''[His Majesty the King]'' has asked me to form a government and I have accepted.|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=David Cameron becomes PM: Full Downing Street statement |first= David |last=Cameron |agency=BBC News |date=11 May 2010 | accessdate = 11 May 2010 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8676405.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id = TezCBzlB3d8|title = Prime Minister Gordon Brown arrives at Downing Street}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id = Ebj1vT7CMyk|title = Transfer of Power from James Callaghan to Margaret Thatcher}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Throughout the United Kingdom, the Prime Minister outranks all other dignitaries except members of the Royal Family, the [[Lord Chancellor]], and senior ecclesiastical figures.&lt;ref group=note&gt;These include: in [[England and Wales]], the [[Church of England|Anglican]] Archbishops of Canterbury and York; in Scotland, the Lord High Commissioner and the [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|Moderator of the General Assembly]] of the [[Church of Scotland]]; in [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Church of Ireland|Anglican]] and Roman Catholic Archbishops of Armagh and Dublin and the [[Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland|Moderator of the General Assembly]] of the [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland|Presbyterian Church]].&lt;/ref&gt;

At present the Prime Minister receives £142,500 including a salary of £65,737 as a Member of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/latest-news/2010/05/a-new-politics-cutting-ministerial-pay-50065 |title=A new politics: cutting Ministerial pay |publisher=Number10.gov.uk |date=13 May 2010 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2006, the [[Lord Chancellor]] was the highest paid member of the government ahead of the Prime Minister. This reflected the Lord Chancellor's position as head of the [[Judiciary of England and Wales#Judicial salaries|judicial pay scale]]. The [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]] eliminated the Lord Chancellor's judicial functions and also reduced the office's salary below that of the Prime Minister.

The Prime Minister is customarily a member of the [[Privy Council]] and thus entitled to the appellation &quot;[[The Right Honourable]]&quot;. Membership of the Council is retained for life. It is a constitutional convention that only a Privy Counsellor can be appointed Prime Minister. Most potential candidates have already attained this status. The only occasion when a non-Privy Counsellor was the natural appointment was Ramsay MacDonald in 1924. The issue was resolved by appointing him to the Council immediately prior to his appointment as Prime Minister.

According to the now defunct [[Department for Constitutional Affairs]], the Prime Minister is made a Privy Counsellor as a result of taking office and should be addressed by the official title prefixed by &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; and not by a personal name. Although this form of address is employed at formal occasions it is rarely used by the media. Since &quot;Prime Minister&quot; is a position, not a title, the incumbent should be referred to as &quot;the Prime Minister&quot;. The title &quot;Prime Minister&quot; (e.g. &quot;Prime Minister David Cameron&quot;) is technically incorrect but is sometimes used erroneously outside the United Kingdom, and has more recently become acceptable within it.&lt;ref&gt;An example of &quot;Prime Minister&quot; being used as a title, even by Number 10 Downing Street. {{cite web |url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/latest-news/2010/09/pm-attending-european-council-55107|title=PM attends European Council |date=16 September 2010 |accessdate=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the UK, the expression &quot;Prime Minister Cameron&quot; (or &quot;Prime Minister Brown&quot;, etc.) is never used, although it, too, is sometimes used by foreign dignitaries and news sources.

[[File:chequers2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Chequers.'' The Prime Minister's official country home.]]
While in office, the Prime Minister officially resides at [[10 Downing Street]] in London and is also entitled to use the country house of [[Chequers]] in [[Buckinghamshire]].

Upon retirement, it is customary for the Sovereign to grant a Prime Minister some honour or dignity. The honour commonly, but not invariably, bestowed is membership of the United Kingdom's most senior order of chivalry, the [[Order of the Garter]]. The practice of creating retired Prime Ministers Knights (or, in the case of Margaret Thatcher, Ladies) of the Garter has been fairly prevalent since the middle-19th century. On the retirement of a Prime Minister who is Scottish, it is likely that the primarily Scottish honour of the [[Order of the Thistle]] will be used instead of the Order of the Garter, which is generally regarded as an English honour.

It has also been common for Prime Ministers to be granted a [[peerage]] upon retirement from the Commons, which elevates the individual to the [[House of Lords]]. Formerly, the peerage bestowed was usually an [[earldom]] (which was always hereditary), with Churchill offered a [[Duke of London|dukedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Winston S. Churchill, 1874-1965: a comprehensive historiography and annotated bibliography |last=Rasor |first=Eugene L. |year=2000 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-313-30546-7 |page=205 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6PpNUK5u1lkC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;lpg=PA205}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the 1960s, hereditary peerages have generally been eschewed, and [[life peerage]]s have been preferred, although in 1984 [[Harold Macmillan]] was created [[Earl of Stockton]]. Sir Alec Douglas-Home, Harold Wilson, James Callaghan and Margaret Thatcher accepted life peerages, although Douglas-Home had previously disclaimed his hereditary title as [[Earl of Home]]. However, Edward Heath, John Major and Tony Blair did not accept peerages of any kind, although Mr. Heath and Mr. Major were later appointed as Knights of the Garter. {{Asof|2010}}, Gordon Brown remains a Member of Parliament, retaining his Commons seat in the [[United Kingdom general election 2010|2010 general election]] and choosing to remain a backbencher.

'''Roy Sydney George Hattersley, Baron Hattersley''' [[FRSL]] (born 28 December 1932) is a [[British people|British]] [[British Labour Party|Labour]] politician, author and [[journalist]] from [[Sheffield, England|Sheffield]]. He served as [[Deputy Leader of the Labour Party]] from 1983 to 1992.

==Early life==
Roy Hattersley has been a socialist and Labour supporter from his youth, electioneering at the age of 12 for his local MP and city councillors, beginning in 1945. His own mother, [[Enid Hattersley]], was a city councillor, and later, [[Lord Mayor of Sheffield]] (in 1981). Enid Hattersley kept the fact secret from her son (until he was in his 50s) that his father, who died an atheist, had been a Roman Catholic priest, Father Frederick Hattersley, and had renounced the Church to marry her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Published: 12:00AM BST 22 May 2001 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1331135/Enid-Hattersley.html |title=Enid Hattersley's obituary |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2001-05-22 |accessdate=2010-05-20 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
He won a scholarship to [[The City School (Sheffield)|Sheffield City Grammar School]] and went from there to study at the [[University of Hull]]. Having been accepted to read English at the [[University of Leeds]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,2010899,00.html &quot;Books for pleasure&quot;], ''The Guardian'', 12 February 2007. Retrieved on 13 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; he was diverted into reading Economics when told by a Sheffield colleague of his mother that it was necessary for a political career.

At university Hattersley joined the Socialist Society (SocSoc) and was one of those responsible for changing its name to the &quot;Labour Club&quot; and affiliating it with the non-aligned [[International Union of Socialist Youth]] rather than the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-backed [[International Union of Students]]. Hattersley became chairman of the new club and later treasurer, and he went on to chair the [[Labour Students|National Association of Labour Student Organisations]]. He also joined the executive of the IUSY.

==Member of Parliament==
After graduating Hattersley worked briefly for a Sheffield steelworks and then for two years with the [[Workers' Educational Association]]. He also married his wife Molly, who became a headteacher and educational administrator. In 1956 he was elected to the City Council as Labour representative for Crookesmoor and was, very briefly, a [[Justice of the Peace|JP]]. On the Council he spent time as chairman of the Public Works Committee and then the Housing Committee.

His aim became a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] seat, and he was eventually selected for Labour to stand for election in the [[Sutton Coldfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Sutton Coldfield]] constituency but lost to the Conservative [[Geoffrey William Lloyd|Geoffrey Lloyd]] in 1959. He kept hunting for prospective candidacies, applying for twenty-five seats over three years. In 1963 he was chosen as the [[prospective parliamentary candidate]] for the multi-racial [[Birmingham, Sparkbrook (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Sparkbrook]] constituency (following a well-known local 'character', Jack Webster) and facing a Conservative majority of just under 900. On 16 October 1964 he was elected by 1,254 votes; he was to hold that seat for the next eight general elections.

===Journalist===
At first he was [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to [[Margaret Herbison]], the Minister for Pensions. His [[maiden speech]] was on a housing subsidies bill. Still a [[Gaitskellism|Gaitskellite]], he also joined the [[1963 Club]]. He also wrote his first ''Endpiece'' column for ''[[The Spectator (1828)|The Spectator]]'' (the column moved to ''[[The Listener (British magazine)|The Listener]]'' in 1979 and then to ''[[The Guardian]]'').

===Ministerial positions===
Despite the support of [[Roy Jenkins]] and [[Tony Crosland]] he did not gain a ministerial position until 1967, joining [[Ray Gunter]] at the Ministry of Labour. He was reportedly disliked by Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] as a &quot;Jenkinsite&quot;. The following year he was promoted to Under Secretary in the same ministry, now led by [[Barbara Castle]], and become closely involved in implementing the unpopular [[Prices and Incomes Act]]. In 1969 after the fiasco over ''[[In Place of Strife]]'' he was promoted to deputy to [[Denis Healey]], the Minister of Defence, following the death of [[Gerry Reynolds (UK politician)|Gerry Reynolds]]. One of his first jobs, while Healey was hospitalised, was to sign the Army Board Order &amp;ndash; putting troops into [[Northern Ireland]]. &lt;!-- Later Hattersley agreed to the forming of the [[Ulster Defence Regiment]], as an attempt to create a non-sectarian replacement for the [[B-Specials]]. NOTE: PROOF?? --&gt;

===European Common Market===
The Labour defeat of 1970 ended six years of Labour government. Hattersley was to hold his seat &amp;mdash; often increasing his majority &amp;mdash; but for the next twenty-six years as MP he was to spend twenty one in Opposition. He was appointed Deputy Foreign Affairs Spokesman, again under Healey, which involved a lot of foreign travel if nothing else. He also took a Visiting Fellowship to the [[Kennedy School of Government]] at Harvard. During this time he also became an enthusiastic supporter of the [[European Union|Common Market]], his &quot;drift to the political centre&quot; put him at odds with much of the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]] (PLP). He was one of the sixty-nine 'rebels' who voted with the Conservative government for entry into the EEC, which precipitated the resignation of [[Roy Jenkins#Deputy Leader of the Labour Party|Roy Jenkins]] as deputy leader (10 April 1972) and eventually a permanent split within Labour. (It was the adoption of a referendum on the EEC as shadow cabinet policy that caused Jenkins to resign.) For 'standing by' the party Hattersley was appointed Shadow Defence Secretary 1972 to 1973 and later Shadow Secretary of State for Education (the one government post he had always coveted).

===Privy Council===
In the Wilson government of 1974 he was appointed the (non-cabinet) Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, and in 1975 he was appointed a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]lor. Hattersley headed the British delegation to Reykjavik during the &quot;[[Cod War]]&quot;, but was primarily given the task of renegotiating the terms of the UK's membership of the EEC. Following the resignation of Wilson he voted for [[Jim Callaghan]] in the ensuing leadership contest in order to stop [[Michael Foot]] (a man &quot;[who] for all his virtues... could not become Prime Minister&quot;). Under Callaghan he finally made it into the Cabinet as [[Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection]], a position he held until Labour's defeat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 General Election]].

&quot;Election campaigns all have distinct characteristics. For Labour, 1983 was ludicrous, and 1987 was desperate. At least 1979 was only dismal.&quot; In 1979 Hattersley was appointed to shadow [[Michael Heseltine]] as the Minister for the Environment, contending with him over the cuts in local government powers and the &quot;[[Right to Buy Scheme|right to buy]]&quot;. Following the rise of the '[[hard left]]', as demonstrated at the 1980 Labour Conference, Callaghan resigned. The leadership contest was between [[Denis Healey|Healey]] and Foot, with Hattersley organising Healey's campaign. &quot;An electorate [the PLP] deranged by fear&quot; elected Foot. Healey was made deputy leader and Hattersley was appointed Shadow Home Secretary, but felt that Foot was &quot;a good man in the wrong job&quot;, &quot;a baffling combination of the admirable and the absurd&quot;. Healey was challenged for his post in 1981, following electoral rule changes, by [[Tony Benn]], retaining his post by 50.426% to 49.574%. Hattersley felt that &quot;the Bennite alliance [although defeated] ... played a major part in keeping the Conservatives in power for almost twenty years&quot;. Hattersley also had very little regard for those Labour defectors who created the SDP in 1981. He helped found Labour Solidarity (1981–83) and credits the group with preventing the disintegration of the Party.

===Deputy Leader===
Following Labour's devastating defeat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]] Foot declined to continue as leader. Hattersley stood in the subsequent leadership election, [[John Smith (Scottish politician)|John Smith]] was his campaign manager and a young [[Peter Mandelson]] also impressed Hattersley. The other competitors were [[Neil Kinnock]], [[Peter Shore]] and [[Eric Heffer]]. Hattersley had the support of most of the Shadow Cabinet, but the majority of the PLP, the constituency groups and the unions were in favour of Kinnock. In the final count Kinnock secured around three times as many votes as the second-place Hattersley.

As was standard practice at the time Hattersley became deputy leader. The combination was promoted at the time as being a &quot;dream ticket&quot; with Kinnock a representative of the left of the party and Hattersley of the right. Hattersley remained deputy for eight years and also Shadow Chancellor until 1987, when he moved back to Shadow Home Affairs.

Kinnock and Hattersley went to work to rehabilitate Labour after 1983. After the [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)|Miners' Strike]] they purged the [[Militant tendency]] and in 1988 they fought off a leadership challenge by Tony Benn and [[Eric Heffer]]. Defeat in 1987 was expected; by 1992 it was much more even.  Labour had regularly topped opinion polls since 1989 and at one stage had a lead of up to 15 points over the Tories, though this was cut back and more than once overhauled by the Tories after the resignation of [[Margaret Thatcher]] as prime minister to make way for [[John Major]] in November 1990.

In the run-up to the 1992 election, Hattersley was present at the Labour Party rally in his native [[Sheffield]] and backed up Kinnock with the claim that &quot;with every day that passes, Neil looks more and more like the real tenant of number 10 Downing Street&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Barnard |first=Stephanie |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/sheffield/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8170000/8170344.stm |title=BBC - Sheffield &amp; South Yorkshire - Kinnock came and didn't conquer |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-07-27 |accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Backbenches and retirement==
The [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|general election]] was finally held on 9 April 1992, but saw Labour defeated by the Conservatives, who were elected for a fourth successive term. Kinnock announced his resignation as party leader on 13 April, and on the same day Hattersley announced his intention to resign from the deputy leadership of the party, with the intention of carrying on in their roles until the new leadership was elected that summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/13/newsid_2830000/2830895.stm | work=BBC News | title=1992: Labour's Neil Kinnock resigns | date=13 April 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hattersley supported his friend [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] in the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1992|leadership contest]], which Smith won in July that year. In 1993 Hattersley announced he would leave politics at the following [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|general election]]. He was made a [[life peer]] as Baron Hattersley of [[Sparkbrook]], in the County of [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]].

Hattersley was long regarded as being on the right of the party, but with [[New Labour]] in power he found himself criticising a Labour government from the left, even claiming that ''&quot;Blair's Labour Party is not the Labour Party I joined&quot;''. He has also mentioned repeatedly that he would be supporting [[Gordon Brown]] as leader.

Hattersley is the author of many books including three novels and many biographies. In 1996 he was fined for an incident involving his dog, [[Buster (dog)|Buster]], after it killed a goose in one of London's royal parks. He later wrote the &quot;diary&quot; of Buster, writing from the dog's perspective on the incident, in which it claimed to have acted in self-defence. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}  In January 2010, after the death of Buster the previous October, Hattersley adopted a white bull-terrier dog called Jake from an animal rescue centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/body_and_soul/article6995319.ece] Times, 21 Jan 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Hattersley appeared in a documentary on the DVD for the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial, ''[[Doctor Who and the Silurians]]'', to discuss the political climate that existed at the time of making the serial.

He now writes a regular column, &quot;In Search Of England&quot;, for the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' about different parts of the United Kingdom; it normally appears in the paper on Tuesdays.

In 2003 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rslit.org/content/fellows|title = Royal Society of Literature All Fellows|publisher= Royal Society of Literature|accessdate = 9 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His latest book, a biography of Lloyd George ''The Great Outsider: David Lloyd George'' was published by Little, Brown in 2010.

'''Sedgefield''' is a [[county constituency]] represented in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It elects one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) by the [[first past the post]] system of election. Sedgefield is situated in [[County Durham]], an area renowned for its [[mining]] history and very strong affiliation to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].

From its recreation in [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983]] until 27 June 2007, the seat had been held by the Labour Party's [[Tony Blair]], the former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]].  He resigned as a Member of Parliament on the same day as he resigned as Prime Minister, which triggered a [[Sedgefield by-election, 2007|by-election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6243558.stm Blair resigns as prime minister], [[BBC News]], 27 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the by-election on 19 July 2007, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidate [[Phil Wilson (British politician)|Phil Wilson]] was elected on a reduced majority.

==Boundaries==
Following the review of parliamentary representation in [[County Durham]], the [[Boundary Commission for England]] made only minor changes to the Sedgefield constituency for the 2010 general election. The seat, in [[County Durham]] in the [[North East England|North East]] region of [[England]], comprises:

The electoral wards used in the modified seat are;
*Bishop Middleham and Cornforth, Broom, Chilton, Ferryhill, [[Fishburn]] and Old Trimdon, Greenfield Middridge, Neville and Simpasture, New Trimdon and [[Trimdon Grange]], Sedgefield, Shafto St Marys, West and Woodham from the former [[Sedgefield (borough)|Borough of Sedgefield]].
*Thornley and Wheatley Hill, and Wingate from the former [[Easington (district)|Easington]] district.
*Heighington and Coniscliffe, Hurworth, [[Middleton St George]], and Sadberge and Whessoe from [[Darlington]].

From 1997 to 2010, the boundaries were:
*most of the former [[Sedgefield (borough)|Borough of Sedgefield]], including [[Sedgefield]] town, [[Newton Aycliffe]], [[Ferryhill]] and parts of [[Trimdon]].
*most of the area (but not the electorate) of the [[Darlington (borough)|Borough of Darlington]], surrounding the actual town of [[Darlington]] on 3 sides.
*in the south of the former [[Easington (district)|Easington]] district, [[Wingate, County Durham|Wingate]], [[Thornley, Durham|Thornley]], [[Wheatley Hill]] and the rest of Trimdon.

== History ==
The constituency has been in use for two separate periods. It was first created in time for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|1918 general election]], and then abolished for the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 election]]. It was recreated in 1983 and has existed ever since.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6901">In [[British politics]], the '''Shadow Home Secretary''' is the person within the [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (UK)|shadow cabinet]] who 'shadows' the [[Home Secretary]]; this effectively means scrutinising government policy on home affairs including [[policing]], [[national security]], [[immigration]], the [[criminal justice system]], the [[prison|prison service]], and matters of [[citizenship]].  If and when the opposition party is elected to government, the Shadow Home Secretary often becomes the new [[Home Secretary]] though this is not always the case.  The present Shadow Home Secretary is [[Yvette Cooper]].

'''St John's College''' is a [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|constituent college]] of the [[University of Oxford]], one of the larger Oxford colleges with approximately 390 undergraduates, 200 postgraduates and over 100 academic staff.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/343/About_St-John%27s.html&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1555 by Sir [[Thomas White (merchant)|Thomas White]], a merchant. St. John's is reputed to be the wealthiest in Oxford, with a [[financial endowment]] of £313 million as of 2010&lt;ref name=&quot;2010finances&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://d307gmaoxpdmsg.cloudfront.net/collegeaccounts0910/St_Johns.pdf |title=Report and Financial Statements |author= St John's College, Oxford |date=31 July 2011 |accessdate=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==History==
On 1 May 1555, [[Thomas White (merchant)|Sir Thomas White]], lately [[Lord Mayor of London]], obtained a Royal Patent of Foundation to create an eleemosynary institution for the education of students within the University of Oxford. White, a [[Roman Catholic]], originally intended St John's to provide a source of educated Roman Catholic clerics to support the Counter-Reformation under [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]], and indeed [[Edmund Campion]], the Roman Catholic martyr, studied here.

White acquired buildings on the east side of [[St Giles', Oxford|St Giles']], north of [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] and [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity]] Colleges, which had belonged to the former College of St Bernard, a monastery and house of study of the [[Cistercian]] order that had been closed during the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. Initially the new St John's College was rather small and not well endowed financially. During the reign of Elizabeth I the fellows lectured in rhetoric, Greek, and dialectic, but not directly in theology. However, St John's initially had a strong focus on the creation of a proficient and educated priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, Charles Bernard (1983) ''John Case and Aristotelianism in Renaissance England''. Kingston [Ont.] : McGill-Queen's University Press ISBN 0773510052&lt;/ref&gt;

White was Master of the [[Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors|Merchant Taylors' Company]], and established a number of educational foundations, including the [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]]. Although the College was closely linked to such institutions for many centuries, it became a more open society in the later 19th century. (Closed scholarships for students from the Merchant Taylors' School, however, persisted until the late 20th century.) The endowments which St John's was given at its foundation, and during the twenty or so years afterward, served it very well and in the second half of the nineteenth century it benefited, as ground landlord, from the suburban development of the city of [[Oxford]] and was unusual among Colleges for the size and extent of its property within the city.

Although primarily a producer of Anglican clergymen in the earlier periods of its history, St John's also gained a reputation for both law and medicine. Fellows and alumni have included Archbishop [[William Laud]], [[Jane Austen]]'s father and brothers, the early [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] intellectual [[Sidney Ball]], who was very influential in the creation of the [[Workers' Educational Association]] (WEA), [[Rushanara Ali]], Labour Politician and one of the first [[Bangladeshis]] to gain a PPE degree at St. John's College and more recently, [[Tony Blair]], former prime minister of the United Kingdom.

The patronage of the parish of St Giles was included in the endowment of the college by Thomas White. Vicars of St Giles were formerly either Fellows of the College, or ex-Fellows who were granted the living on marriage (when Oxford fellows were required to be unmarried). The College retains the right to present candidates for the benefice to the bishop.&lt;ref&gt;Kettler, Sarah Valente &amp; Trimble, Carole (2003) ''The Amateur Historian's Guide to the Heart of England''. Sterling, Va.:  Capital Books 1892123657&lt;/ref&gt;

== Student Life ==

=== Facilities ===

Unusually amongst Oxford colleges, St John's offers onsite accommodation to all undergraduates for the duration of their course (although students are not obliged to take up this offer). For first years, this is mostly in the Thomas White Quad, with some students accommodated in the Beehive.

=== College societies ===

The St John's College Boat Club is the largest college society; everybody is encouraged to try out the sport. In [[Summer Eights]] 2011, six SJCBC boats qualified for the racing, and both the Women's and Men's First Boat Won &quot;Blades&quot; (bumping the boat in front on each day of racing), making SJCBC one of the most successful boathouses on the river.

In 2006 St John's launched SJCtv, becoming the first Oxford college to start its own television station.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sjctv.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; The station shows two half-hour programmes a term, at college welfare nights. SJCtv's stated aim is to enhance community spirit, inform students of the college's welfare provisions and allow students a forum for creative expression.

St John's used to be the home of two dining societies, the King Charles Club (&quot;KCC&quot;) and the Archery Club. Tony Blair has been pictured at a gathering of the latter in the St John's gardens.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-439587/Blair-boater-crude-hand-gesture-Class-75.html&lt;/ref&gt;In recent years these societies have become largely defunct although are still celebrated by former members.

The college also has an active drama group, who operate under the banner of St. John's Mummers. They produce one performance per term, ranging from modern &quot;in-yer-face&quot; to Shakespearean garden plays. In 2010 they performed an adaptation of [[Alfred Jarry]]'s [[Ubu Roi]], called &quot;Ubu&quot; at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] under the name &quot;Awful Pie Theatre.&quot;

SASJO (the St John's and [[St Anne's College, Oxford|St Anne's]] Orchestra) both performs (every term) and rehearses in the St John's Auditorium. The orchestra is non-audition and open to all University of Oxford students, regardless of college.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sasjo.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

==College buildings==
[[Image:st johns college oxford.jpg|thumb|right|Canterbury Quad, St John's College, Oxford : The entrance to the Great Lawn and Groves, which were not, despite popular legend, landscaped by [[Capability Brown]]]]

The college is situated on a single large site. Most of the college buildings are organized around seven quadrangles (quads):
*Front Quadrangle: mainly the 15th-century buildings of the former St Bernard's monastery.
*Canterbury Quadrangle: the first example of Italian [[Renaissance architecture]] in Oxford, substantially commissioned by Archbishop Laud and completed in 1636&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/3766/St%20John%20the%20College%20and%20the%20Merchant%20Taylors.pdf.download |title=St. John, the College and the Merchant Taylors’ Company |author= Mr Michael Riordan |date=24 June 2011 |accessdate=24 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Much of the college library is here, including the Old Library on the south side, and the Laudian Library above the eastern colonnade, overlooking the garden.
*North Quadrangle: an irregularly-shaped mixture of 18th, 19th, and 20th century ranges. These include the 18th-century buttery staircase adjoining the hall, the block containing the Senior Common Room, the 19th-century range along [[St Giles', Oxford|St Giles']], and the &quot;Beehive&quot; (1958–60), made up of non-regular hexagonal rooms. The Senior Common Room ceiling, completed in 1742, features the craftsmanship of Thomas Roberts, who also worked on the [[Radcliffe Camera]] and the [[Codrington Library]].&lt;ref&gt;Tyack, Geoffrey (1998) ''Oxford: An Architectural Guide''. Oxford University Press, 1998 ISBN 0198174233&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dolphin Quadrangle: built in the early 20th century on the site of the old Dolphin Inn.
*Sir Thomas White Quadrangle: late 20th century (informally known as &quot;Tommy White Quad&quot;). The building is an early work by [[Ove Arup]] which won the 1976 Concrete Society Award, but is considered a monstrosity by many members of the college. It is not actually a quadrangle, but an L-shaped building partially enclosing an area of garden.
*Garden Quadrangle: a modern (1993) neo-Italianate quadrangle including an auditorium and other conference facilities by [[MJP Architects]].
*Kendrew Quadrangle: the most recent quad, completed in 2010.

Other buildings on the site include the Holmes Building (a south spur off the Canterbury Quad, containing fellows' rooms), and Middleton Hall, a curious house, north of the North Quad and abutting the [[Lamb &amp; Flag (Oxford)|Lamb and Flag]], which has a stone frontage in early 19th-century style, though the back part is in Victorian red brick and contains a Jacobean staircase (perhaps originally from another building).

In addition, the College accommodates a number of students, traditionally second-year undergraduates but nowadays also a significant number of final year undergraduates and graduate students, in the houses owned by the college on [[Museum Road]] and [[Blackhall Road]]. These houses back onto Kendrew Quadrangle, completed in October 2010, named after  [[John Kendrew|Sir John Kendrew]], former President of the College, Nobel Laureate and the College's greatest benefactor of the twentieth century. This construction has been dubbed &quot;the last great quad in the city centre&quot; and is notable for its attempt to provide energy from sustainable sources: much of the energy required to heat the building is provided by a combination of solar panels on the roof, geothermal pipes extending deep below the basement and woodchips from the College wood used to fire the boilers.

As the first phase of The Kendrew Quadrangle project Dunthorne Parker Architects were appointed by the College to refurbish three Grade II Listed buildings fronting on to St Giles. Works were carried out to No 20 St Giles which became alumni residential accommodation, The Black Hall, a 17th century building, which became teaching accommodation and The Barn, which became an exhibition and performance space. This project was awarded an Oxford Preservation Trust Plaque in 2008.  

Since the College also incorporates Middleton Hall (see above) and owns St Giles House, the former judge's house north of the college, the opening of Kendrew Quadrangle mean that the College extends for almost the entire length of the east side of St Giles, as well as owning parts of the opposite side. This includes the [[The Eagle and Child]] pub (where the well-known writers [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and [[C. S. Lewis]] often met their literary friends), complementing the [[Lamb &amp; Flag (Oxford)|Lamb and Flag]] opposite it on the College side of the road, which the College owns and operates (using the profits to fund graduate scholarships).

The [[Senior Common Room|SCR]] was renovated and extended in 2004 and 2005 by [[MJP Architects]]. The new building was given an award by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] in 2006.

'''Anthony Charles Lynton &lt;!-- Please do not add 'Tony' here as it is obvious information, and ugly to interrupt the full name at this point --&gt;Blair''' (born 6 May 1953)&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Tony Blair| url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9003134 | work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[British people|British]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician who served as the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister of the]] [[United Kingdom]] from 2 May 1997 to 27 June 2007. He was the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Sedgefield (UK Parliament constituency)|Sedgefield]] from 1983 to 2007 and [[List of United Kingdom Labour Party leaders|Leader of the Labour Party]] from 1994 to 2007. He resigned from all of these positions in June 2007.

Blair was elected Leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1994|leadership election of July 1994]], following the sudden death of his predecessor, [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]]. Under his leadership, the party used the phrases &quot;[[New Labour]]&quot; and &quot;New Socialism&quot; to define its policy, and moved away from its support of [[state socialism]] since the 1960s and created a new version of the [[ethical socialism]] that was last pursued by [[Clement Attlee]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bevir. ''New Labour: a critique''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2005. Pp. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of Blair claim that &quot;New Labour&quot; did not adhere to socialism as claimed, and that it effectively advocated [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Florence Faucher-King, Patrick Le Galès, Gregory Elliott. The New Labour experiment: change and reform under Blair and Brown. Stanford, California, USA: Stanford University Press, 2010. Pp. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Blair subsequently led Labour to a landslide victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]]. At 43 years old, he became the youngest Prime Minister since [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] in 1812. In the first years of the New Labour government, Blair's government implemented a number of [[New Labour, New Life For Britain|1997 manifesto]] pledges, introducing the [[National Minimum Wage Act 1998|minimum wage]], [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]] and [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]], and carrying out [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution]], establishing the [[Scottish Parliament]], the [[National Assembly for Wales]], and the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]].

Blair's role as Prime Minister was particularly visible in foreign and security policy, including in [[Northern Ireland]], where he was involved in the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]]. From the start of the [[War on Terror]] in 2001, Blair strongly supported the foreign policy of US President [[George W. Bush]], notably by participating in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Blair is the Labour Party's longest-serving Prime Minister, the only person to have led the Labour Party to three consecutive general election victories, and the only Labour Prime Minister to serve consecutive terms more than one of which was at least four years long.

He was succeeded as Leader of the Labour Party on 24 June 2007 and as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007 by [[Gordon Brown]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown is UK's new prime minister&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Brown is UK's new prime minister |work=BBC News  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6245682.stm |date=27 June 2007 |accessdate=27 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day he resigned as Prime Minister, he was appointed the official Envoy of the [[Quartet on the Middle East]]. In May 2008, Blair launched his [[Tony Blair Faith Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7427809.stm |title=Blair launches faith foundation |publisher=BBC News  |date=30 May 2008 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in July 2009 by the launching of the ''[[Faith and Globalisation initiative|Faith and Globalisation Initiative]]'' with Yale University in the US, [[Durham University]] in the UK and the [[National University of Singapore]] in Asia to deliver a postgraduate programme in partnership with the Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tony Blair launches Faith and Globalisation programme at Durham University |url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/news/newsitem/?itemno=8243|accessdate=13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Yale and Tony Blair Launch Faith and Globalization Initiative |url=http://opa.yale.edu/news/article.aspx?id=6040|publisher=Yale University Office of Public Affairs|accessdate=13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and family life==
Blair was born in Edinburgh, Scotland&lt;ref name=&quot;Edinburgh Evening-birthplace&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Blair's birthplace is bulldozed in Edinburgh | url = http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1156262006 | work=[[Edinburgh Evening News]] | publisher=Johnston Press plc |date=9 August 2006| accessdate =18 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 6 May 1953,&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt; the second son of [[Leo Blair (senior)|Leo]] and Hazel Blair (''née'' Corscadden). Leo Blair, the illegitimate&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2000/dec/21/adoptionandfostering.localgovernment1 Blair: 'Why adoption is close to my heart'], 21 December 2000, ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; son of two English actors, had been adopted as a baby by Glasgow shipyard worker James Blair and his wife, Mary. Hazel Corscadden was the daughter of George Corscadden, a butcher and [[Orange Order|Orangeman]] who moved to Glasgow in 1916 but returned to (and later died in) [[Ballyshannon]] in 1923, where his wife, Sarah Margaret (née Lipsett), gave birth to Blair's mother, Hazel, above her family's grocery shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ballyshannon.ie/Article_Listings.aspx?tscategory_id=276&amp;category_name=Local+Map |title= Local Map |publisher=[[Ballyshannon]] Town Council |accessdate=22 November 2007 |quote=Lipsett's Grocery Shop: This is the birthplace of Hazel (Corscadden) Blair, mother of British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

===Life as a child===
Blair has one elder brother, [[William Blair (judge)|Sir William Blair]], a [[High Court]] judge, and a younger sister, Sarah. Blair spent the first 19 months of his life at the family home in Paisley Terrace in the Willowbrae area of Edinburgh. During this period, his father worked as a junior tax inspector whilst also studying for a law degree from the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edinburgh Evening-birthplace&quot;/&gt; In the 1950s, his family spent three and a half years in Adelaide, Australia, where his father was a lecturer in law at the [[University of Adelaide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Tony's big adventure | url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/secondterm/story/0,8224,944191,00.html|work=The Observer |location=UK | publisher=Guardian Newspapers Ltd. |date=27 April 2003 | accessdate =18 November 2006  | first=Kamal | last=Ahmed}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blairs lived close to the university, in the suburb of [[Dulwich, South Australia|Dulwich]]. The family returned to the UK in the late 1950s, living for a time with Hazel Blair's stepfather, William McClay, and her mother at their home in [[Stepps]], near Glasgow. He spent the remainder of his childhood in [[Durham]], England, where his father lectured at [[Durham University]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Education===
After attending [[Chorister School, Durham|The Chorister School]] in [[Durham]] from 1961 to 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thechoristerschool.com/alumni/rollcall.php |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071021173809/http://www.thechoristerschool.com/alumni/rollcall.php |archivedate=21 October 2007 |title=Alumni Roll Call |work=Durham Chorister School website |accessdate=22 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair boarded at [[Fettes College]], a prestigious independent school in Edinburgh, during which time he met [[Charles Falconer, Baron Falconer of Thoroton|Charlie Falconer]] (a pupil at the rival [[Edinburgh Academy]]), whom he later appointed [[Lord Chancellor]]. He reportedly modelled himself on [[Mick Jagger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1678432,00.html |title=Tony Blair absolutely modelled himself on Mick Jagger |author=Victoria Powell |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=6 January 2006 |accessdate=22 November 2007 |quote=TV producer Victoria Powell explains how she recreated the PM's adventures in 1970s rock }}&lt;/ref&gt; His teachers were unimpressed with him, his biographer [[John Rentoul (journalist)|John Rentoul]], reported that &quot;All the teachers I spoke to when researching the book said he was a complete pain in the backside and they were very glad to see the back of him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/edwardblack/Tony-Blairs-revolting-schooldays.2548089.jp |title=Tony Blair's revolting schooldays |author=Ed Black's diary |work=The Scotsman |location=Edinburgh |date=23 July 2004 |accessdate=22 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair was arrested at Fettes, having been mistaken for a burglar as he climbed into his dormitory using a ladder after having been out late.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Blair in a boater, a crude hand gesture, and the Class of '75 | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=439587&amp;in_page_id=1770&amp;ico=Homepage&amp;icl=TabModule&amp;icc=picbox&amp;ct=5|work=Daily Mail |location=UK | publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd. |date=3 March 2006 | accessdate =8 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Cherie Blair.jpg|left|thumb|Tony Blair's wife, [[Cherie Blair|Cherie Booth]], [[Queen's Counsel|QC]].]]
After Fettes, Blair spent a year in London, where he attempted to find fame as a rock music promoter before reading [[jurisprudence]] at [[St John's College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Michaelmas Term 1974 | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | series=Complete Alphabetical List of the Resident Members of the University of Oxford | year=1974 | page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a student, he played guitar and sang in a rock band called [[Ugly Rumours (band)|Ugly Rumours]]. During this time, he dated future ''[[American Psycho]]'' director [[Mary Harron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800256658/bio
| title = Mary Harron Biography| accessdate =18 November 2006| year = 2006 | work=Yahoo! Movies| publisher=Yahoo! Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was influenced by fellow student and Anglican priest [[Peter Thomson (priest)|Peter Thomson]], who awakened within Blair a deep concern for religious faith and left-wing politics. While Blair was at Oxford, his mother Hazel died of cancer, which greatly affected him. After graduating from Oxford in 1975 with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|Second Class Honours]] BA in Jurisprudence, Blair became a member of [[Lincoln's Inn]], enrolled as a pupil barrister, and met his future wife, [[Cherie Blair|Cherie Booth]] (daughter of the actor [[Antony Booth|Tony Booth]]) at the law chambers founded by [[Derry Irvine, Baron Irvine of Lairg|Derry Irvine]] (who was to be Blair's first Lord Chancellor), [[11 King's Bench Walk Chambers]]. He appears in a number of reported cases, for example as in ''[[Nethermere (St Neots) Ltd v Gardiner]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Nethermere (St Neots) Ltd v Gardiner]]'' [1983] ICR 319&lt;/ref&gt; where he represented employers unsuccessfully in an attempt to deny female factory workers holiday pay.

===Marriage and children===
Blair married [[Cherie Booth]], a Roman Catholic and future [[Queen's Counsel]], on 29 March 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cherieblair.org/highlights/2010/03/my-memory-is-not-infallible.html |title=Events &amp; Visits &amp;#124; Cherie celebrates her 30th Wedding Anniversary this spring |publisher=Cherie Blair |accessdate=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have four children: Euan, Nicholas, Kathryn, and Leo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/05/10/blair.facts/index.html CNN.com] Facts: Life and times of Tony Blair&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/822238.stm |title=Blair's son 'drunk and incapable' |publisher=BBC News  |date=6 July 2000 |accessdate=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leo, delivered by the Royal Surgeon/Gynaecologist [[Marcus Setchell]], was the first legitimate child born to a serving Prime Minister in over 150 years—since Francis Russell was born to [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] on 11 July 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/756400.stm |title=Welcome distraction for Tony Blair |publisher=BBC News  |date=20 May 2000 |accessdate=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair was criticised when it was discovered that one child had received private tuition from staff at [[Westminster School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/blair-caught-up-in-private-tutor-row-647334.html |title=Blair caught up in private tutor row |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=5 July 2002 |accessdate=20 April 2010 | first1=Marie | last1=Woolf | first2=Richard | last2=Garner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal health===
Blair suffered from chest pains on Sunday 19 October 2003 and underwent a [[cardioversion]] at [[Hammersmith Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;Wintour, Patrick; Boseley Sarah. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2003/oct/20/labour.politics Tony Blair in heart scare], ''The Guardian'', 20 October 2003. Retrieved 18 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious faith===
In an interview with [[Michael Parkinson]] broadcast on [[ITV1]] on 4 March 2006, Blair referred to the role of his Christian faith in his decision to go to war in Iraq, stating that he had prayed about the issue, and saying that God would judge him for his decision: &quot;I think if you have faith about these things, you realise that judgement is made by other people … and if you believe in God, it's made by God as well.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Blair 'prayed to God' over Iraq | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4772142.stm |publisher=BBC News  |date=3 March 2006 | accessdate =18 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A longer exploration of his faith can be found in an interview with ''[[Third Way Magazine]]''. There he says that &quot;I was brought up as [a Christian], but I was not in any real sense a practising one until I went to Oxford. There was an Australian priest at the same college as me who got me interested again. In a sense, it was a rediscovery of religion as something living, that was about the world around me rather than some sort of special one-to-one relationship with a remote Being on high. Suddenly I began to see its social relevance. I began to make sense of the world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thirdway.org.uk/past/showpage.asp?page=43 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927142102/http://www.thirdway.org.uk/past/showpage.asp?page=43 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |title=Practising for Power: Tony Blair  |author=Roy McCloughry |work=[[Third Way Magazine]]: the modern world through Christian eyes |date=14 September 1993 |accessdate=22 November 2007 |quote=Since 1993, Third Way has been talking in depth to men and women who help to shape our society or set the tone of our culture. We spoke to Tony Blair on 14 September 1993, before the spin doctors closed around him, when he was still shadow Home Secretary and had a full head of hair.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point [[Alastair Campbell]], Blair's director of strategy and communications, intervened in an interview, preventing the Prime Minister from answering a question about his Christianity, explaining, &quot;We don't do God&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1429109/Campbell-interrupted-Blair-as-he-spoke-of-his-faith-We-dont-do-God.html|title=Campbell interrupted Blair as he spoke of his faith: 'We don't do God' |author=Colin Brown |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=3 May 2003 |accessdate=28 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cherie Blair's friend and &quot;spiritual guru&quot; [[Carole Caplin]] is credited with introducing her and her husband to various [[New Age]] symbols and beliefs, including &quot;magic pendants&quot; known as &quot;BioElectric Shields&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,6903,856064,00.html &quot;Ev'rybody must get stones&quot;], The Observer, 8 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The most controversial of the Blairs' New Age practices occurred when on holiday in Mexico.

Later on, Blair questioned the Pope's attitude towards homosexuality, arguing that religious leaders must start &quot;rethinking&quot; the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7987566.stm |title=Blair questions Papal gay policy |publisher=BBC News  |date=8 April 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later rebuked by [[Vincent Nichols]], the new archbishop of Westminster, who said that Catholic thinking was 'rather different' from the kind promoted by the former prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Steve Doughty |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1169204/Catholic-leaders-rebuke-Blair.html |title=Catholic leader's rebuke for Blair |work=The Daily Mail |date=4 November 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 December 2007, it was disclosed that Blair, who in 1996, had been reprimanded by Cardinal [[Basil Hume]] for receiving [[Holy Communion]] at Mass despite not being a Catholic, in contravention of canon law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,2082533,00.html |title=Blair doesn't need intermediaries to communicate with God.

The Pope and his advisors criticised some of Blair's political actions, but followed up with a reportedly unprecedented red-carpet welcome, which included Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster [[Cormac Murphy-O'Connor]], who would be responsible for Blair's [[Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults|Catholic instruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article1801237.ece |title=Blair will be welcomed into Catholic fold via his ‘baptism of desire’ |author=Ruth Gledhill, Jeremy Austin and Philip Webster |work=The Times |location=UK |date=17 May 2007 |accessdate=22 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 January 2009, Blair, upon a visit to the British Embassy in Washington, D.C., described, in the guest book, his home as being 'Jerusalem'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Walters | first = Simon | title = An identity crisis for Blair: Former PM describes Jerusalem as 'home' |work=Daily Mail |location=UK | date = 12 April 2007 | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1169342/An-identity-crisis-Blair-Former-PM-describes-Jerusalem-home.html | accessdate =15 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed shortly after, on the occasion of his addressing of the National Prayer Breakfast, by his discussion of the issue of religion in the world and the Middle East peace process in his address and how he spends so much of his time in the Holy Land and in the Holy City. He reported his Palestinian guide as bemoaning the fate of his nation looking to heaven and saying “Moses, Jesus, Mohammed: why did they all have to come here?&quot; For Blair the Holy City is &quot;a good place to reflect on religion: a source of so much inspiration; an excuse for so much evil.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/8558 |title=Tony Blair addresses Obama's first annual National Prayer Breakfast |publisher=Ekklesia|date=5 February 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Alastair Campbell's diary, Blair often read the Bible before taking any important decisions. He states that Blair had a &quot;wobble&quot; and considered changing his mind on the eve of the [[Bombing of Iraq (December 1998)|bombing of Iraq in 1998]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/jan/14/tony-blair-alastair-campbell-diaries Alastair Campbell diaries: How Blair's Bible reading prompted Iraq 'wobble'] guardian.co.uk, Friday 14 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==
Blair joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] shortly after graduating from Oxford in 1975. During the early 1980s, he was involved in Labour politics in [[Hackney South and Shoreditch (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney South and Shoreditch]], where he aligned himself with the &quot;[[soft left]]&quot; of the party.  In 1982 Blair was selected as the Labour candidate in the safe [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] seat of [[Beaconsfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Beaconsfield]], where there was a forthcoming by-election. Although Blair lost the [[Beaconsfield by-election, 1982|Beaconsfield by-election]] (the only election he lost in his 25-year political career) he gained 10% of the vote and acquired a profile within the party. In contrast to his later centrism, Blair made it clear in a letter he wrote to Labour leader Michael Foot in July 1982, that he had &quot;come to Socialism through Marxism&quot; and considered himself on the left. The letter was eventually published in June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Tony | last = Blair | title = The full text of Tony Blair's letter to Michael Foot written in July 1982 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/06/16/nletter116.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2006/06/16/ixuknews.html  | work=The Daily Telegraph | publisher=Telegraph Media Group Ltd. |date = July 1982| accessdate =18 November 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Blair found the newly created [[Sedgefield (UK Parliament constituency)|constituency of Sedgefield]], a notionally safe Labour seat near where he had grown up in [[Durham]]. The branch had not made a nomination, and Blair visited them. Several sitting MPs displaced by boundary changes were interested in securing selection to fight the seat. With the crucial support of [[John Burton (political agent)|John Burton]], Blair won their endorsement; at the last minute, he was added to the short list and won the selection over [[Les Huckfield]]. Burton later became Blair's [[Election agent|agent]] and one of his most trusted and longest-standing allies.

Blair's election literature in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 UK general election]] endorsed left-wing policies that Labour advocated in the early 1980s. He called for Britain to leave the [[European Economic Community|EEC]], though he had told his selection conference that he personally favoured continuing membership. He also supported [[nuclear disarmament|unilateral nuclear disarmament]] as a member of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]. Blair was helped on the campaign trail by soap opera actress [[Pat Phoenix]], his father-in-law's girlfriend. Blair was elected as MP for Sedgefield despite the party's landslide defeat in the general election.

In his [[maiden speech]] in the House of Commons on 6 July 1983, Blair stated, &quot;I am a socialist not through reading a textbook that has caught my intellectual fancy, nor through unthinking tradition, but because I believe that, at its best, socialism corresponds most closely to an existence that is both rational and moral. It stands for cooperation, not confrontation; for fellowship, not fear. It stands for equality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2006/4/20/170221.shtml | title = On Democracy | accessdate =18 November 2006| last = Navrozov | first = Lev |date=21 April 2006 | work=NewsMax.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.logosjournal.com/issue_3.4/seddon.htm | title = America's Friend: Reflections on Tony Blair| accessdate =18 November 2006| last = Seddon| first = Mark | year = 2004| work=Logos 3.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour Party is declared in its constitution to be a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] party&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.labour.org.uk/aboutlabour|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061116065904/http://www.labour.org.uk/aboutlabour|archivedate = 16 November 2006| title = About Labour| accessdate =18 November 2006| year = 2006| publisher=The Labour Party}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than a [[social democratic]] party; Blair himself organised this declaration of Labour to be a socialist party when he dealt with the change to the party's [[Clause IV]] in their constitution.

Once elected, Blair's political ascent was rapid. He received his first front-bench appointment in 1984 as assistant Treasury spokesman. In May 1985, he appeared on BBC's [[Question Time]], arguing that the Conservative Government's Public Order White Paper was a threat to civil liberties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/programme/LCAQ520E |title=BBC Archive |publisher=BBC Programme Catalogue|accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Blair demanded an inquiry into the [[Bank of England]]'s decision to rescue the collapsed [[Johnson Matthey]] Bank in October 1985 and embarrassed the government by finding a EEC report critical of British economic policy that had been countersigned by a member of the Conservative government.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} By this time, Blair was aligned with the reforming tendencies in the party (headed by leader [[Neil Kinnock]]) and was promoted after the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 election]] to the shadow Trade and Industry team as spokesman on the [[City of London]]. In 1987, he stood for election to the [[Shadow Cabinet]], receiving 71 votes.&lt;ref&gt;John Carvel, &quot;A fresh team of 'Yaks' will take on Labour's burden&quot;, ''The Guardian'', 9 July 1987, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blair became [[Shadow Home Secretary]] under [[John Smith (UK politician)|John Smith]]. John Smith died suddenly in 1994 of a heart attack. Blair beat [[John Prescott]] and [[Margaret Beckett]] in the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1994|subsequent leadership election]] and became [[Leader of the Opposition (UK)|Leader of the Opposition]]. As is customary for the holder of that office, Blair was appointed a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillor]].

===Leader of the Labour Party===
Blair announced at the end of his speech at the 1994 Labour Party conference that he intended to replace [[Clause IV]] of the party's constitution with a new statement of aims and values. This involved the deletion of the party's stated commitment to &quot;the common ownership of the means of production and exchange&quot;, which was widely interpreted as referring to wholesale nationalisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s 326&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher=Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0465041957|page= 326|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a special conference in April 1995, the clause was replaced by a statement that the party is 'democratic socialist'.&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s 326&quot;/&gt;

He inherited the Labour leadership at a time when the party was ascendant over the Tories in the opinion polls since the Tory government's reputation for monetary excellence was left in tatters by the [[Black Wednesday]] economic disaster of September 1992. Blair's election as leader saw Labour support surge higher still&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393323.stm |work=BBC News  | title=1997: Labour landslide ends Tory rule | date=15 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; in spite of the continuing economic recovery and fall in unemployment that the Conservative government (led by [[John Major]]) had overseen since the end of the 1990–92 [[Early 1990s recession|recession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393323.stm | work=BBC News | title=1997: Labour landslide ends Tory rule | date=15 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1996 Labour Party conference, Blair stated that his three top priorities on coming to office were &quot;education, education, and education&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6564933.stm &quot;Education, education, education&quot;] BBC News,14 May 2007. Retrieved 8 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aided by the unpopularity of [[John Major]]'s Conservative government (itself deeply divided over the European Union), &quot;New Labour&quot; won a landslide victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], ending 18 years of Conservative Party government, with the heaviest Conservative defeat since [[United Kingdom general election, 1832|1832]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Kingdom|title=Government and Politics in Britain: An Introduction|publisher=Polity Press|edition=3rd|month=April|year=2003|isbn=978-0745625942|page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Smith's leadership of the Labour Party, there were discussions with [[Paddy Ashdown]], the leader of the [[Liberal Democrats]], about forming a [[coalition]] government if the next general election resulted in a [[hung parliament]]. After Blair became leader, these talks continued – despite virtually every opinion poll since late 1992 having shown Labour with enough support to form a majority. However, the scale of the Labour victory meant that there was ultimately never any need for a coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epolitix.com/latestnews/article-detail/newsarticle/top-ten-lib-dem-breakthrough-moments/ |title=Top Ten: Lib Dem 'breakthrough moments' |publisher=ePolitix.com |date=24 April 2010 |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prime Minister==
{{Main|Premiership of Tony Blair}}

Blair became the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] on [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|2 May 1997]], serving concurrently as [[First Lord of the Treasury]], [[Minister for the Civil Service]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]]. The 43-year old Blair became the youngest person to become Prime Minister since [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] in 1812, at the age of 42.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/page4.asp| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070604003655/http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/page4.asp| archivedate = 4 June 2007| title = Biography: The Prime Minister Tony Charles Lynton Blair| accessdate =18 November 2006| publisher=Prime Minister's Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; With victories in 1997, [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001]], and [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005]], Blair was the Labour Party's longest-serving prime minister, the only person to lead the party to three consecutive general election victories.

===Northern Ireland===
[[Image:TonyBlairArmagh1998.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Blair addressing a crowd in [[Armagh]] in 1998.]]
His contribution towards assisting the [[Northern Ireland Peace Process]] by helping to negotiate the [[Good Friday Agreement]] (after 30 years of conflict) was widely recognised.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News Archive, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/10/newsid_2450000/2450823.stm &quot;1998: Northern Ireland peace deal reached&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Stephens, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/36fa51da-fe30-11db-bdc7-000b5df10621.html &quot;Blair’s remarkable record&quot;], ''Financial Times'', 10 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Omagh Bombing]] on 15 August 1998, by members of the [[Real IRA]] opposed to the peace process, which killed 29 people and wounded hundreds, Blair visited the [[County Tyrone]] town and met with victims at [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast]].&lt;ref&gt;Telegraph.co.uk: ''Omagh, Northern Ireland's worst atrocity'' 24 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===War on Terror===
In his first six years in office Blair ordered British troops into battle five times, more than any other prime minister in British history. This included Iraq in both [[Bombing of Iraq (December 1998)|1998]] and [[Iraq War|2003]]; [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]] (1999); [[Sierra Leone Civil War|Sierra Leone]] (2000) and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] (2001).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/6361771.stm Blair: The Inside Story] [[BBC News]], 22 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

From the start of the [[War on Terror]] in 2001, Blair strongly supported the [[Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration|foreign policy]] of [[George W. Bush]], participating in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. The invasion of Iraq was particularly controversial, as it attracted widespread public opposition and 139 of Blair's MPs opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-10518842 |work=BBC News  | title=The rise and fall of New Labour | date=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he faced criticism over the policy itself and the circumstances in which it was decided upon. [[Alastair Campbell]] described Blair's statement that the intelligence on WMDs was &quot;beyond doubt&quot; as his &quot;assessment of the assessment that was given to him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by satirist [[Armando Ianucci]] and called his 'favourite sentence of the Inquiry so far' Radio 5 Live 21 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Blair stated that he would have supported removing Saddam Hussein from power even in the face of proof that he had no such weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Riazat Butt and Richard Norton-Taylor |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/dec/12/tony-blair-iraq-chilcot-inquiry |title=Tony Blair admits: I would have invaded Iraq anyway |work=Guardian |date=12 December 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playwright [[Harold Pinter]] and former Malaysian Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohammad]] accused Blair of war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-08/01/content_8890239.htm |title=Malaysian former PM Mahathir accuses Tony Blair as war criminal|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|date=1 August 2008 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=David Fickling |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/dec/07/iraq.booksnews |title=Pinter demands war crimes trial for Blair|work=The Guardian |date= 7 December 2005|accessdate=20 April 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testifying before the [[Iraq Inquiry]] on 29 January 2010, Blair said Saddam was a &quot;monster and I believe he threatened not just the region but the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8485694.stm|title=Iraq inquiry hears defiant Blair say: I'd do it again|publisher=BBC News |date=29 January 2010|accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Blair said that British and American attitude towards Saddam Hussein had &quot;changed dramatically&quot; after 11 September attacks.

===Relationship with Parliament===
One of his first acts as Prime Minister was to replace the then twice-weekly 15-minute sessions of [[Prime Minister's Questions]] held on Tuesdays and Thursdays with a single 30-minute session on Wednesdays. In addition to PMQs, Blair held monthly press conferences at which he fielded questions from journalists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page3347.asp | title = PM: Saddam and his regime will be removed| accessdate =21 November 2006|date=25 March 2003| work=Prime Minister's Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Matthew | last = Tempest | title = Tony Blair's press conference | url = http://politics.guardian.co.uk/media/story/0,,1299024,00.html | work=The Guardian | publisher=Guardian Newspapers Ltd. |date=7 September 2004 | accessdate =21 November 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and – from 2002 – broke precedent by agreeing to give evidence twice yearly before the most senior Commons select committee, The Liaison Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1392335/Blair-agrees-to-face-grilling-by-select-committee-critics.html &quot;Blair agrees to face grilling by select committee critics&quot;] Daily Telegraph, 27 April 2002.

===Events prior to resignation===
As the [[casualties of the Iraq War]] mounted, Blair was accused of misleading Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2003/nov/08/20031108-111529-7094r/ Blair a casualty of UK support for Iraq war], ''[[The Washington Times]]'', 8 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/diplomats-suppressed-document-lays-bare-the-lies-behind-iraq-war-428545.html Diplomat's suppressed document lays bare the lies behind Iraq war], ''The Independent'', 15 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and his popularity dropped dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10102727 Blair Risked Much in Support of U.S.-UK Friendship], [[National Public Radio]], 9 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1422365/Talk-of-war-dents-Blairs-popularity.html Talk of war dents Blair's popularity], ''Daily Telegraph'', 17 February 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour party's overall majority in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]] was reduced to 66.
As a combined result of the [[Blair-Brown pact]], Iraq war and low approval ratings, pressure built up within the Labour party for Blair to resign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=2405434&amp;page=1 Tony Blair to Resign in a Year], [[ABC News]], 7 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,482199,00.html The End of the Tony Show], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 10 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 September 2006, Blair publicly stated he would step down as party leader by the time of the [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC) conference held 10–13 September 2007,&lt;ref name=&quot;iwillquit&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title = I will quit within a year —Blair| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5322094.stm|publisher=BBC News |date=7 September 2006| accessdate =18 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; having promised to serve a full term during the previous general election campaign. On 10 May 2007, during a speech at the Trimdon Labour Club, Blair announced his intention to resign as both Labour Party leader and Prime Minister. At a special party conference in [[Manchester]] on 24 June 2007, he formally handed over the leadership of the Labour Party to [[Gordon Brown]], who had been [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown is UK's new prime minister&quot;/&gt; Blair tendered his resignation on 27 June 2007 and his successor, Gordon Brown assumed office the same afternoon.

In 2001, Blair said, &quot;We are a left of centre party, pursuing economic prosperity and social justice as partners and not as opposites&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Polly Toynbee, Michael White and Patrick Wintour [http://society.guardian.co.uk/futureforpublicservices/story/0,,550059,00.html &quot;We're a left-of-centre party pursuing prosperity and social justice&quot;], ''The Guardian'', 11 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
Blair has rarely applied such labels to himself, but he promised before the 1997 election that New Labour would govern &quot;from the radical centre&quot;, and according to one lifelong Labour Party member, has always described himself as a [[social democracy|social democrat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hulver.com/scoop/story/2007/5/17/73955/4678 &quot;The Death of Socialism&quot;], 17 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, Labour Party backbenchers and other left wing critics typically place Blair to the [[right of centre]].&lt;ref&gt;Neal Lawson, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,2060360,00.html &quot;A decade of Blair has left the Labour party on its knees&quot;], ''The Guardian'', 19 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A [[YouGov]] opinion poll in 2005 also found that a small majority of British voters, including many New Labour supporters, place Blair on the right of the political spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;YouGov UK Polling Report, [http://www.ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/30 ''Left vs Right''], 23 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kellner, [http://www.newstatesman.com/200210280019 &quot;What's left of the Labour leader?&quot;], ''New Stateman'', 28 October 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Financial Times]]'' on the other hand has argued that Blair is not conservative, but instead a populist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/9526a670-04dc-11dc-80ed-000b5df10621.html &quot;Why Blair was no conservative&quot;], ''Financial Times'', 18 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[Clause IV]] of the Labour Party's constitution defines the party as &quot;Democratic Socialist&quot;.

Critics and admirers tend to agree that Blair's electoral success was based on his ability to occupy the centre ground and appeal to voters across the political spectrum, to the extent that he has been fundamentally at odds with traditional Labour Party values.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Richards, [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/article2531627.ece &quot;Blair the politician: A conjuror who lost touch with his party&quot;], ''The Belfast Telegraph'', 11 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Some left wing critics have argued that Blair has overseen the final stage of a long term shift of the Labour Party to the right, and that very little now remains of a Labour Left.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Marquesee, [http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/isj91/marqusee.htm &quot;Labour's long march to the right&quot;], ''International Socialism'', Issue 91, Summer 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charlie Kimber, [http://web.archive.org/web/20060321091802/http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/article.php?article_id=5147 &quot;Can the left reclaim the Labour Party?&quot;], ''Socialist Worker'', 2 August 2002&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that Blair's long term dominance of the centre has forced his Conservative opponents to shift a long distance to the left, in order to challenge his [[hegemony]] there.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Rice-Oxley, [http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0511/p01s03-woeu.html &quot;Tony Blair's decade of peace and war&quot;], ''The Christian Science Monitor'', 11 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Cowell, [http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/10/01/news/brits.php &quot;Tory leader urges British opposition to stake out 'center ground'&quot;], ''International Herald Tribune'', 1 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Blair has raised taxes (but did not increase income tax for high-earners{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}); introduced a minimum wage and some new employment rights (while keeping Margaret Thatcher's anti-trade union legislation{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}); introduced significant constitutional reforms; promoted new rights for gay people in the [[Civil Partnership Act 2004]]; and signed treaties integrating Britain more closely with the EU.

===Environmental record===
Blair has criticised other governments for not doing enough to solve [[Global warming|global climate change]]. In a 1997 visit to the United States, he made a comment on &quot;great industrialised nations&quot; that fail to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Again in 2003, Blair went before the [[United States Congress]] and said that climate change &quot;cannot be ignored&quot;, insisting &quot;we need to go beyond even [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2003/1118energy_sandalow.aspx Tony Blair and Global Warming] Brookings, 18 November 2003.

===Foreign policy===
====Relationship with the United States====
[[Image:Blair Bush Whitehouse (2004-11-12).jpg|thumb|250px|Tony Blair and [[George W. Bush]] shake hands after their press conference in the East Room of the White House on 12 November 2004.]]
Along with enjoying a close relationship with [[Bill Clinton]], Blair formed a strong political alliance with [[George W. Bush]], particularly in the area of foreign policy. At one point, [[Nelson Mandela]] described Blair as &quot;the U.S. foreign minister&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Mandela condemns US stance on Iraq | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2710181.stm |publisher=BBC News  |date=30 January 2003|accessdate =18 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair has also often openly been referred to as &quot;Bush's poodle&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Blair battles &quot;poodle&quot; jibes | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2721513.stm |publisher=BBC News  |date=3 February 2003|accessdate =30 November 2006 | first=Nick | last=Assinder}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kendall Myers]], a senior analyst at the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], reportedly said that he felt &quot;a little ashamed&quot; of Bush's treatment of the Prime Minister and that his attempts to influence US policy were typically ignored: &quot;It was a done deal from the beginning, it was a one-sided relationship that was entered into with open eyes... There was nothing, no payback, no sense of reciprocity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Bush 'routinely ignoring Blair' | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6158435.stm |publisher=BBC News  |date=30 November 2006|accessdate =30 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his part, Bush lauded Blair and the UK. In his post-[[11 September attacks|11 September]] speech, for example, he stated that &quot;America has no truer friend than Great Britain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html |title=Address to a Joint Session of Congress and the American People |author=[[George W.

Once again, we are joined together in a great cause – so honoured the British Prime Minister has crossed an ocean to show his unity of purpose with America. Thank you for coming, friend. (Applause.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alliance between Bush and Blair seriously damaged Blair's standing in the eyes of many British people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foreignaffairs/story/0,,1828225,00.html |title=Stand up to US, voters tell Blair |author=Julian Glover and Ewen MacAskill |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=25 July 2006 |accessdate=22 November 2007 |quote=Britain should take a much more robust and independent approach to the United States, according to a Guardian/ICM poll published today, which finds strong public opposition to Blair's close working relationship with President Bush. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair argued it is in Britain's interest to &quot;protect and strengthen the bond&quot; with the United States regardless of who is in the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.pm.gov.uk/output/Page6526.asp | title = PM's speech on US Elections| accessdate =29 May 2007|date=3 November 2004| publisher=Prime Minister's Office }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a perception of one-sided compromising personal and political closeness led to serious discussion of the term &quot;Poodle-ism&quot; in the UK media, to describe the &quot;[[Special Relationship]]&quot; of the UK government and Prime Minister with the US White House and President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Hugo Young in Washington |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/nov/14/iraq.foreignpolicy |title=Hugo Young: Blair has not been a poodle, but poodleism still beckons |work=The Guardian |date= 14 November 2002|accessdate=20 April 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A revealing conversation between Bush and Blair, with the former addressing the latter as &quot;[[Yo, Blair|Yo [or Yeah], Blair]]&quot; was recorded when they did not know a microphone was live at the G8 conference in Russia in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/5188258.stm |title=Transcript: Bush and Blair's unguarded chat|publisher=BBC News  |date=18 July 2006 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}.

====Middle East policy and links with Israel====
According to comments in the book, ''Blair'', written by [[Anthony Seldon]], Blair had a deep feeling for [[Israel]], born in part from his faith.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Seldon, ''Blair'', (London: Free Press, 2005), p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; Blair has been a long time member of the pro-Israel lobby group [[Labour Friends of Israel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Uni&quot;&gt;Assaf Uni, [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/932399.html Finance scandal has local community worried], [[Haaretz]], 10 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Blair met [[Michael Levy, Baron Levy|Michael Levy, later Lord Levy]], a pop music mogul and fundraiser.&lt;ref name=&quot;bagman&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/funding/story/0,,1734529,00.html?gusrc=rss | title=There was once a jolly bagman | author=Euan Ferguson |work=Guardian |location=UK|date=19 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair and Levy became close friends and tennis partners.

During his first visit to Israel, Blair thought the Israelis bugged him in his car. He also went on to claim that the Israeli prime minister was merely an &quot;armour-plated bullshitter&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/wintour-and-watt/2011/jan/20/alastaircampbell-binyamin-netanyahu | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Nicholas | last=Watt | title=Britain believes Israeli PM Netanyahu is an 'armour-plated bullshitter' – Alastair Campbell | date=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levy ran the Labour Leader's Office Fund to finance Blair's campaign before the 1997 General Election and raised £12m towards Labour’s landslide victory, Levy was rewarded with a [[life peer|peerage]], and in 2002, Blair appointed Levy as his personal envoy to the Middle East. Levy praised Blair for his 'solid and committed support of the State of Israel'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishcare.org/events/ Jewish Care], Fundraising Dinner 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2092803,00.html |title=Lord Cashpoint's touch of money magic |date=19 March 2006 |last=Wavell |first=Stuart |work=The Sunday Times |location=UK |accessdate =21 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tam Dalyell, while [[Father of the House]] of Commons, suggested in 2003 that Blair's foreign policy decisions were unduly influenced by a cabal of Jewish advisers, including Levy and [[Peter Mandelson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/dalyell-attacks-jewish-cabal-538006.html |title=Dalyell attacks 'Jewish cabal'|work=The Independent |date=4 May 2003 |accessdate=20 April 2010 | location=London | first1=Jo | last1=Dillon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blair, on coming to office, had been 'cool towards the right-wing [[Benjamin Netanyahu|Netanyahu]] government'.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Seldon, ''Blair'', p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; After the election in 1999 of [[Ehud Barak]], with whom Blair forged a close relationship, he became much more sympathetic to Israel.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; From 2001 Blair also built up a relationship with Barak's successor, [[Ariel Sharon]], and responded positively to [[Yasser Arafat|Arafat]], whom he had met thirteen times since becoming prime minister and regarded as essential to future negotiations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; In 2004, 50 former diplomats, including ambassadors to [[Baghdad]] and [[Tel Aviv]], stated they had 'watched with deepening concern' at Britain following the US into war in Iraq in 2003. They criticised Blair's support for the [[Road map for peace]] which included the retaining of [[Israeli settlement]]s on the [[West Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foreignaffairs/story/0,11538,1203898,00.html Diplomats attack Blair's Israel policy], Guardian Unlimited, [[Matthew Tempest]], 26 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Blair was criticised for his failure to immediately call for a ceasefire in the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]].  ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper claimed that at a cabinet meeting before Blair left for a summit with Bush on 28 July 2006, a significant number of ministers pressured Blair to publicly criticise Israel over the scale of deaths and destruction in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1833538,00.html Cabinet in open revolt over Blair's Israel policy], ''[[The Observer]]'', 30 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Blair was criticised for his solid stance alongside US President [[George W.

In March 2010 the [[Advisory Committee on Business Appointments]] revealed that 14 months after resigning as Prime Minister, Blair had served as a paid business consultant to an oil firm with interests in [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blair's fight to keep his oil cash secret: Former PM's deals are revealed as his earnings since 2007 reach £20million|author=Jason Groves|work=Daily Mail |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1259030/Tony-Blairs-secret-dealings-South-Korean-oil-firm-UI-Energy-Corp.html |date=19 March 2010 |accessdate=21 March 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news raised concerns that he had profited financially from contacts he made during the Iraq war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2010/03/20/blair-s-secret-pay-deal-with-iraq-oil-firm-115875-22125177/ Daily Mirror &quot;Tony Blair's secret lucrative advisory job with Iraq oil firm&quot; 20 March 2010].

==Relationship with media==
===Rupert Murdoch===
Blair was reported to have been supported by [[Rupert Murdoch]] the founder of the [[News Corporation]] [[media conglomerate|organisation]].&lt;ref&gt;Gaby Hinsliff, [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/politics/story/0,,1827023,00.html &quot;The PM, the mogul and the secret agenda&quot;], ''The Observer'', 23 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, while leader of the Opposition, Blair disclosed in the Commons register of interests that he was a guest of Murdoch when he flew to meet him in [[Hayman Island]].&lt;ref name='R000977'&gt;{{cite news | first= Andrew| last= Grice| title=Cameron, Murdoch and a Greek island freebie | date=24 October 2008 | url =http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cameron-murdoch-and-a-greek-island-freebie-971470.html |work=The Independent |location=UK | accessdate =25 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contacts with UK media proprietors===
A [[Cabinet Office]] [[freedom of information]] response, released the day after Blair handed over power to [[Gordon Brown]], documents Blair having various official phone calls and meetings with [[Rupert Murdoch]] of [[News Corporation]] and [[Richard Desmond]] of ''Northern and Shell Media''.&lt;ref name='spoke'&gt;{{cite news | title=Blair and Murdoch spoke days before Iraq war | date= 19 July 2007| url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/jul/19/freedomofinformation.iraq |work=The Guardian |location=UK | accessdate =26 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period between September 2002 and April 2005, Blair and Murdoch are documented speaking 6 times; three times in the 9 days before the [[Iraq war]], including the eve of the 20 March US and UK invasion, and on 29 January, 25 April and 3 October 2004. Between January 2003 and February 2004, Blair had three meetings with Richard Desmond; on 29 January and 3 September 2003 and 23 February 2004.&lt;ref name='foi'&gt;{{cite news | title=When Murdoch met Blair – information released | url =http://www.bindmans.com/index.php?id=289 | work=Bindmans | accessdate =26 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='vs'&gt;{{cite news | title=Blair &amp; Murdoch – FOI v Campbell | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/cgi-perl/mt/mt-comments.cgi |work=BBC  | accessdate =26 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The information was disclosed after a three and a half year battle by the [[Liberal Democrats]]' [[Lord Avebury]].&lt;ref name='spoke'/&gt; Lord Avebury's initial October 2003 information request was dismissed by then leader of the Lords, [[Baroness Amos]].&lt;ref name='spoke'/&gt; A following complaint was rejected, with [[Downing Street]] claiming the information compromised free and frank discussions, while [[Cabinet Office]] claimed releasing the timing of the PM's contacts with individuals is undesirable, as it might lead to the content of the discussions being disclosed.&lt;ref name='spoke'/&gt; While awaiting a following appeal from Lord Avebury, the cabinet office announced that it would release the information.
Lord Avebury said: &quot;The public can now scrutinise the timing of his (Murdoch's) contacts with the former Prime Minister, to see whether they can be linked to events in the outside world.&quot;&lt;ref name='spoke'/&gt;

===Media portrayal===
Blair is acknowledged by most{{Who|date=July 2010}} to be a highly skilful media performer who comes over as charismatic, informal, and articulate.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} A few months after becoming Prime Minister he gave a tribute to [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] on the morning of her death in August 1997, in which he famously described her as &quot;the People's Princess&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buerkle |first=Tom |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/01/news/01iht-london.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Charles Takes Diana's Body Home From Paris – World Mourns the 'People's Princess' |work=The New York Times  |date=1 September 1997 |accessdate=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1556863/Tony-coined-the-peoples-princess.html |title=Tony coined the 'people's princess' |publisher=Telegraph |date=9 July 2007 |accessdate=20 July 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After taking office in 1997, Blair gave particular prominence to his press secretary, who became known as the [[Prime Minister's Official Spokesman]] (the two roles have since been separated). Blair's first PMOS was [[Alastair Campbell]], who served in that role from May 1997 to 8 June 2001, after which he served as the Prime Minister's Director of Communications and Strategy until his resignation on 29 August 2003 in the aftermath of the [[Hutton Inquiry]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

==Relationship with Labour Party==
Blair's apparent refusal to set a date for his departure was criticised by the British press and Members of Parliament. It has been reported that a number of cabinet ministers believed that Blair's timely departure from office would be required to be able to win a fourth election.&lt;ref name=independent-09-04-06/&gt; Some ministers viewed Blair's announcement of policy initiatives in September 2006 as an attempt to draw attention away from these issues.&lt;ref name=independent-09-04-06&gt;{{cite news|title='Deluded': Extraordinary attack on Blair by Cabinet |date=4 September 2006 |work=The Independent |location=UK |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article1325433.ece  | first=Francis | last=Elliott | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gordon Brown===
{{See also|Blair–Brown deal}}
After the death of [[John Smith (UK politician)|John Smith]] in 1994, Blair and his close colleague [[Gordon Brown]] (they shared an office at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]) were both seen as possible candidates for the party leadership. They agreed not to stand against each other, it is said, as part of a supposed Blair-Brown pact. Brown, who considered himself the senior of the two, understood that Blair would give way to him: opinion polls soon indicated, however, that Blair appeared to enjoy greater support among voters.&lt;ref&gt;A MORI opinion poll published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' on 15 May found that, among the general public, Blair had the support of 32%, John Prescott 19%, Margaret Beckett 14%, Gordon Brown 9% and [[Robin Cook]] 5%.&lt;/ref&gt; Their relationship in power became so turbulent that (it was reported) the [[Deputy Prime Minister|deputy prime minister]], [[John Prescott]], often had to act as &quot;marriage guidance counsellor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labour2003/comment/0,,1056215,00.html | title = A marriage on the rocks | author=[[Andrew Rawnsley]] |work=The Observer |location=UK | publisher=Guardian Newspapers Ltd. | date = 5 October 2003 | accessdate =5 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 June 2007, Blair officially resigned as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] after ten years in office, and he was officially confirmed as Middle East [[Diplomacy|envoy]] for the United Nations, European Union, United States, and Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;envoy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Blair becomes Middle East envoy |work=BBC News  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6244358.stm |date=27 June 2007 |accessdate=27 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair originally indicated that he would retain his parliamentary seat after his resignation as Prime Minister came into effect; however, on being confirmed for the Middle East role he resigned from the Commons by taking up an [[List of Stewards of the Chiltern Hundreds|office of profit]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent27June2007&quot; /&gt; President George W.

During the first nine days of the [[2008–2009 Israel-Gaza conflict]], Blair was allegedly spotted at the opening of the [[Armani]] store at [[Knightsbridge]]. Aides said he had been in phone contact with other world leaders since the fighting began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Matthew Kalman |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1105250/As-Gaza-torn-apart-war-Middle-East-peace-envoy-Tony-Blair-Hes-HOLIDAY.html |title=As Gaza is torn apart by war, where is Middle East peace envoy Tony Blair?

===Private sector===
In January 2008, it was confirmed that Blair would be joining investment bank [[JPMorgan Chase]] in a &quot;senior advisory capacity&quot;&lt;ref name=JPMC&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7180306.stm|title=Tony Blair joins investment bank|publisher=BBC News |date=10 January 2008|accessdate=10 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he would advise [[Zurich Financial Services]] on [[climate change]]. Some sources have claimed that his role at JP Morgan will pay more than $1m a year.&lt;ref name=JPMC/&gt; This additional salary will contribute to annual earnings of over £7m.&lt;ref&gt;Hencke, David [http://politics.guardian.co.uk/tonyblair/story/0,,2248529,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront Insurance job takes Blair's earnings above £7m], [[The Guardian]], 29 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Blair also gives lectures and earns up to US$250,000 for a 90-minute speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5034235.ece Lectures see Tony Blair earnings jump over £12m] Times Online, 29 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/people,1565,blairs-earnings-are-12m-a-year,52596 |title=People: Tony Blair’s earnings are £12m a year |publisher=The First Post |date=29 October 2008 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yale University announced on 7 March 2008 that Blair will teach a course on issues of faith and globalisation at the Yale Schools of [[Yale School of Management|Management]] and [[Yale Divinity School|Divinity]] as a [[Howland Memorial Prize|Howland distinguished fellow]] during the 2008–09 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kim |last=Martineau |title=Blair To Teach At Yale Next Year |url=http://www.courant.com/news/custom/topnews/hcu-tonyblair-0307,0,1787038.story |work=[[The Hartford Courant]] |publisher=[[Tribune Company]] |location=[[Hartford, Connecticut]] |date=7 March 2008 |accessdate=7 March 2008}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tony Blair Associates===

Blair has established ''[[Tony Blair Associates]]''. This firm will &quot;allow him to provide, in partnership with others, strategic advice on a commercial and ''pro bono'' [free] basis, on political and economic trends and governmental reform.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5780937.ece Tony Blair Inc: a nice little earner] The Sunday Times, 22 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, Blair has been the subject of criticism for apparent conflicts of interest that allow the former prime minister, now a Middle East peace envoy, to earn large sums of money, both directly and through Tony Blair Associates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/tony-blair/8787053/Tony-Blairs-Byzantine-world-of-advisers-and-lucrative-deals.html Tony Blair's Byzantine world of advisers and lucrative deals] The Daily Telegraph, 24 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/tony-blair/8784596/On-the-desert-trail-of-Tony-Blairs-millions.html On the desert trail of Tony Blair's millions] The Daily Telegraph, 24 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Quartet===
[[Nabil Shaath]], a senior Abbas associate, said that Blair was acting as Israel's &quot;defence attorney&quot; in face of Abbas' application for a [[International recognition of the State of Palestine|Palestinian state]] to be admitted as a full member of the United Nations. According to a recent episode of the investigative documentary series [[Dispatches (TV series)|''Dispatches,'']] on the UK's [[Channel 4]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/episode-guide/series-102/episode-1 The Wonderful World of Tony Blair]&lt;/ref&gt; Blair has used his [[Quartet on the Middle East|Quartet]] role to gain introductions and proximity to Arab leaders, with whom he then signed private consulting contracts  for Tony Blair Associates. He obtained one such contract, worth $40m from the [[Emir of Kuwait]], to advise on reforms, and another from the rulers of the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Blair was instrumental in lobbying Israel to release frequencies in November 2009 for mobile phone company [[Wataniya]] to operate in the [[occupied West Bank]]. Wataniya is owned by the Qatari telecoms giant [[Q-Tel]] which bought Wataniya in 2007 with a $2 billions, loan arranged by the bank [[JP Morgan]], according to ''Dispatches''. Blair also works for JP Morgan, which pays him over $2m a year for providing &quot;strategic&quot; advice. JP Morgan stood to make &quot;substantial profits&quot; if the deal went through, the British documentary said. Israel had tied approval of Wataniya's frequencies to the [[Palestinian National Authority|PA]] dropping efforts to pursue the [[Goldstone report]] on Israeli [[United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict|war crimes in Gaza]], through the UN. Blair also brokered another major deal with Israel for [[British Gas plc|British Gas]] to secure contracts to exploit natural gas fields worth up to $6 billions, in the [[territorial waters]] of the Gaza Strip. Blair negotiated the deal directly with Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]. In 2007, the United Nations Programme of Assistance to the Palestinian People spent over $400,000 on three [[Armored car (VIP)|armoured cars]] for Blair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/10/201110375817236134.html Why the UN must abolish the 'Quartet'.] By [[Ali Abunimah]]. ''[[Al Jazeera]]'', 5 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Council president speculation===
In 2009, there  was speculation in the media that Blair was open to the idea of becoming the first President of the [[European Council]], a post created in the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] that would come into force in 2009, if successfully ratified. [[Gordon Brown]] added his support, but noted that it was premature to discuss candidates before the treaty was approved. A spokesman for Blair did not rule out him accepting the post, but said that he was concentrating on his current role in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grice|first=Andrew|title=Blair emerges as candidate for 'President of Europe'|work=The Independent |location=UK |date=20 October 2007|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article3078889.ece|accessdate=21 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair was later invited to speak on European issues at a rally of [[President Sarkozy]]'s party, the [[Union for a Popular Movement]], on 12 January 2008, which fuelled speculation further.&lt;ref&gt;AFP (2007).

There was opposition to Blair's candidacy for the job. In the UK, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and the [[Liberal Democrats]] both said they would oppose Blair. In Germany, the leader of the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democrats]], [[Guido Westerwelle]], said that he preferred a candidate from a smaller European country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Blair | first=Tony | title=German party cool on Blair for EU | date=28 October 2009 | publisher=BBC World Service News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8329554.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Minister of Luxembourg, [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] emerged as a rival to Blair's candidacy and had the backing for many of the smaller European member states. In November 2009, the Belgian PM [[Herman Van Rompuy]] was named [[President of the European Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8369730.stm|title=EU foreign head dismisses critics|publisher=The BBC|date=20 November 2009|accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Blair | first=Tony | title=Downing Street is less optimistic about Blair campaign to become EU President | date=29 October 2009 | publisher=BBC World Service News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8333192.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charity===
On 14 November 2007, Blair launched the Tony Blair Sports Foundation, which aims to &quot;increase childhood participation in sports activities, especially in the North East of England, where a larger proportion of children are socially excluded, and to promote overall health and prevent childhood obesity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tonyblairsportsfoundation.org/ |title=Tony Blair Sports Foundation |publisher=Tony Blair Sports Foundation |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 May 2008, Blair launched the [[Tony Blair Faith Foundation]] as a vehicle for encouraging different faiths to join together in promoting respect and understanding, as well as working to tackle poverty. Reflecting Blair's own faith but not dedicated to any particular religion, the Foundation aims to &quot;show how faith is a powerful force for good in the modern world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/about-us/mission-statement.html &quot;Mission statement&quot;]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}, Tony Blair Faith Foundation, 30 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Foundation will use its profile and resources to encourage people of faith to work together more closely to tackle global poverty and conflict,&quot; says its mission statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-god-blog/2009/09/faith-foundation-blair-speech|title=Tony Blair’s Faith Foundation speech|work=The New Statesman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===War crimes finding===
On 22 November 2011, a mock war-crimes tribunal put together by the [[Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission]] reached a unanimous verdict that Tony Blair and George W. Bush are guilty of crimes against peace, crimes against humanity, and genocide as a result of their roles in the 2003 Iraq War. The trial, which lasted 4 days, consisting of 5 judges of judicial and academic backgrounds, a court-appointed defence team in lieu of the defendants or representatives, and a prosecution team including international law professor [[Francis Boyle]], does not have powers to apprehend the pair, but issued an order for the findings to be reported to the [[International Criminal Court]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/11/20111128105712109215.html Kuala Lumpur tribunal: Bush and Blair guilty] - Richard Falk, ''Al Jazeera''&lt;/ref&gt; The court's finding received mixed responses, being labelled a &quot;circus&quot; by former UN Special Rapporteur [[Param Cumaraswamy]], and supported as &quot;necessary work&quot; by former US Congresswoman [[Cynthia McKinney]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=36581 Mahathir's War Crimes Court to Name and Shame] ''IPS News''&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, before his resignation, it was reported that Blair would be offered a knighthood in the [[Order of the Thistle]], owing to his Scottish connections (rather than the [[Order of the Garter]], which is usually offered to former Prime Ministers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2007/05/13/dp1301.xml#head1 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080121050131/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2007/05/13/dp1301.xml#head1 |archivedate=21 January 2008 |title=Queen makes Blair an offer that he can refuse  |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=13 May 2007 |accessdate=22 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No such move has been made since, and Blair has reportedly indicated that he does not want the traditional knighthood or peerage bestowed on former prime ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/1574027/Tony-Blair-spurns-honour-system.html |title=Tony Blair spurns honour system |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=30 December 2007 |accessdate=1 September 2010  | first=Melissa | last=Kite}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 February 2009, Blair was awarded the [[Dan David Prize]] by Tel Aviv University for &quot;exceptional leadership and steadfast determination in helping to engineer agreements and forge lasting solutions to areas in conflict&quot;. He was awarded the prize in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=17 February 2009 |url=http://jta.org/news/article/2009/02/17/1003041/blair-is-dan-david-prize-winner |title=Blair wins Dan David Prize| publisher=JTA – Jewish &amp; Israel News |date=17 February 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfi.fr/actuen/articles/110/article_2916.asp |title=Blair's peace-broker prize surreal, say anti-war campaigners |publisher=Radio France Internationale|accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 September 2010, Blair was awarded the [[Liberty Medal]] at the [[National Constitution Center]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. It was presented by former President [[Bill Clinton]], and is awarded annually to men and women of courage and conviction who strive to secure the blessings of liberty to people around the globe.

Because Blair is credited as being instrumental in ending the conflict in [[Kosovo]], boys born in that country following the war have been given the name Toni or [[Tonibler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10576544 |title=Namesakes welcome Tony Blair during Kosovo visit |publisher=BBC |work=BBC News |date=9 July 2010 |accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Economic Forum''' ('''WEF''') is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[non-profit]] [[foundation (non-profit)|foundation]], based in [[Cologny]], [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]]. It describes itself as an independent international organization committed to improving the state of the world by engaging business, political, academic and other leaders of society to shape global, regional and industry agendas.

The Forum is best known for its annual meeting in [[Davos]], a mountain resort in [[Graubünden]], in the eastern [[Alps]] region of Switzerland. The meeting brings together some 2,500 top business leaders, international political leaders, selected intellectuals and journalists to discuss the most pressing issues facing the world, including health and the environment.  

The organisation also convenes some six to eight regional meetings each year in locations such as Latin America and East Asia, as well as undertaking two further annual meetings in China and the United Arab Emirates.

Beside meetings, the foundation produces a series of research reports and engages its members in sector specific initiatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pigman p41-42&quot;&gt;Pigman. pp. 41&amp;ndash;42.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The 2011 annual meeting in Davos was held from 26 January to 30 January. The 2012 meeting was held on 25-29 January 2012, with the theme &quot;The Great Transformation: Shaping New Models&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/AM12/WEF_AM12_ExecutiveSummary.pdf |title=World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2012 Executive Summary document |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Forum was founded in 1971 by [[Klaus Schwab]], a [[Germany|German-born]] business professor at the [[University of Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;Pigman. pp. 6&amp;ndash;22.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally named the &quot;European Management Forum&quot;, it changed its name to the World Economic Forum in 1987 and sought to broaden its vision further to include providing a platform for resolving international conflicts.

In the summer of 1971, Schwab invited 444 executives from [[Western European]] firms to the first European Management Symposium held in the [[Davos Congress Centre]] under the patronage of the [[European Commission]] and European industrial associations, where Schwab sought to introduce European firms to [[United States|American]] management practices. He then founded the WEF as a non-profit organization based in Geneva and drew European business leaders to Davos for the annual meetings each January.&lt;ref&gt;Kellerman. p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1971 Opening.jpg|thumb|Professor Klaus Schwab opens the inaugural European Management Forum in Davos in 1971]]

Schwab developed the [[stakeholder theory|&quot;stakeholder&quot; management approach]] which attributed corporate success on managers taking account of all interests: not merely [[shareholders]], clients and [[customers]], but also [[employees]] and the communities within which the firm is situated, including governments.&lt;ref&gt;Schwab and Kroos.&lt;/ref&gt; Events in 1973, including the collapse of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] fixed-exchange rate mechanism and the [[Arab-Israeli War]], saw the annual meeting expand its focus from management to economic and social issues, and political leaders were invited for the first time to the annual meeting in January 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Registration required|date=January 2011}} [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0304411c-c5e8-11dc-8378-0000779fd2ac,dwp_uuid=01b19234-b4b2-11dc-990a-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1 &quot;Interview: Klaus Schwab&quot;].''[[Financial Times]]''. 22 January 2008.

As the years went by, political leaders began to use the annual meeting as a neutral platform to resolve their differences. The Davos Declaration was signed in 1988 by [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]], helping them turn back from the brink of war. In 1992, [[President of South Africa|South African President]] [[F. W. de Klerk]] met with [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi|Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi]] at the annual meeting, their first joint appearance outside South Africa.

===Research reports===
The foundation also serves as a [[think tank]], and publishes a wide range of reports focusing on issues of concern and importance to Forum communities. In particular, Strategic Insight Teams focus on producing reports of relevance in the fields of competitiveness, global risks and [[scenario planning|scenario thinking]].

The Competitiveness Team&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weforum.org/en/initiatives/gcp/index.htm |title=Issues &amp;#124; World Economic Forum-Issues |work=Weforum.org |publisher=World Economic Forum |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; produces a range of annual economic reports (first published in brackets): the [[Global Competitiveness Report]] (1979) measures competitiveness of countries and economies; The [[Global Information Technology Report]] (2001) assesses their competitiveness based on their IT readiness; the [[Global Gender Gap Report]] examines critical areas of inequality between men and women; the [[Global Risks Report]] (2006) assesses key global risks; the [[Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report|Global Travel and Tourism Report]] (2007) measures travel and tourism competitiveness and the [[Global Enabling Trade Report]] (2008) presents a cross-country analysis of the large number of measures facilitating trade between nations.&lt;ref&gt;Pigman. pp. 43, 92&amp;ndash;112.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initiatives===
The Global Health Initiative was launched by [[Kofi Annan]] at the Annual Meeting in 2002. The GHI's mission was to engage businesses in public-private partnerships to tackle [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]], [[malaria]] and health systems.

The Global Education Initiative (GEI), launched during the Annual Meeting in 2003, brought together international IT companies and governments in Jordan, [[Egypt]] and India which has resulted in new [[personal computer]] hardware in the classrooms and more local teachers trained in [[e-learning]]. This is having a real impact on the lives of children. The GEI model which is scalable and sustainable is now being used as an educational blueprint in other countries including [[Rwanda]].

The Environmental Initiative covers Climate Change and Water. Under the [[2005 G8 Summit|Gleneagles Dialogue on Climate Change]], the [[government of the United Kingdom|U.K. government]] asked the World Economic Forum at the [[31st G8 summit|G8 Summit in Gleneagles in 2005]] to facilitate a dialogue with the business community to develop recommendations for reducing [[greenhouse gas emissions]]. This set of recommendations, endorsed by a global group of CEOs, was presented to leaders ahead of the G8 Summit in [[Toyako]]/[[Hokkaido]] held in July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Richard (20 June 2008).

In an effort to combat corruption, the [[Partnering Against Corruption Initiative]] (PACI) was launched by CEOs from the [[Engineering]] and [[Construction]], [[Energy]] and [[Metals]] and [[Mining]] industries at the Annual Meeting in Davos in January 2004. PACI is a platform for peer exchange on practical experience and dilemma situations. Some 140 companies have signed.&lt;ref&gt;Pigman. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
====Technology Pioneers Programme====
The Technology Pioneers Programme recognizes companies all over the world designing and developing new technologies. The award is given to 30&amp;ndash;50 companies each year. Since 2000, more than 400 companies from 5 continents have been given the award. 

In line with the foundation's commitment to improving the state of the world, the Tech Pioneers are integrated into its activities with the objective to identify and address future-oriented issues on the global agenda, in proactive, innovative and entrepreneurial ways. By bringing these executives together with scientists, academics, NGOs, and foundation members and partners, the foundation's goal is to shed new light on how technologies can be used to, for example, find new vaccines, create economic growth and enhance global communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weforum.org/en/Communities/Technology%20Pioneers/ |title=World Economic Forum — Technology Pioneers |work=Weforum.org |publisher=World Economic Forum |accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In the late 1990s the foundation, along with the [[G7]], [[World Bank]], [[World Trade Organization]] and [[International Monetary Fund]], came under heavy criticism by [[anti-globalisation]] activists who claimed that capitalism and globalization were increasing poverty and destroying the environment. 10,000 demonstrators disrupted the World Economic Forum in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], obstructing the passage of 200 delegates to the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Barret, Bernard (15 November 2000).

American linguist and public intellectual [[Noam Chomsky]] thinks that globalization in the sense of investors and privileged elites or some participants of the World Economic Forum is a propaganda term.

Chomsky said in an interview,{{quote|&quot;The dominant propaganda systems have appropriated the term 'globalization' to refer to the specific version of international economic integration that they favor, which privileges the rights of investors and lenders, those of people being incidental. In accord with this usage, those who favor a different form of international integration, which privileges the rights of human beings, become 'anti-globalist.' This is simply vulgar propaganda, like the term 'anti-Soviet' used by the most disgusting commissars to refer to dissidents. It is not only vulgar, but idiotic. Take the [[World Social Forum]], called 'anti-globalization' in the propaganda system—which happens to include the media, the educated classes, etc., with rare exceptions. The WSF is a paradigm example of globalization. It is a gathering of huge numbers of people from all over the world, from just about every corner of life one can think of, apart from the extremely narrow highly privileged elites who meet at the competing World Economic Forum, and are called 'pro-globalization' by the propaganda system. An observer watching this farce from Mars would collapse in hysterical laughter at the antics of the educated classes.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}}}

The annual meeting has also been decried as a &quot;mix of pomp and platitude&quot;, and criticized for moving away from serious economics and accomplishing little of substance, particularly with the increasing involvement of NGOs that have little or no expertise in economics. Instead of a discussion on the world economy with knowledgeable experts alongside key business and political players, the annual meeting now features the top media political causes of the day, such as global climate change and AIDS in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |author=Gowers, Andrew|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/article716954.ece?token=null&amp;offset=0&amp;page=1|title=Davos: Beanfeast of Pomp and Platitude |newspaper= [[The Sunday Times]]|date= 22 January 2006 |accessdate=25 January 2011|authorlink= Andrew Gowers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public Eye Awards ===

The [[Public Eye Awards]] have been held every year since 2000. It is a counter-event to the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. Public Eye Awards is public competition of the world's worst corporation. In 2011 more than 50,000 voted for companies acted irresponsibly. At a ceremony at a Davos hotel  the &quot;winners&quot; in 2011 were named as [[Indonesia]]n [[palm oil]] diesel maker [[Neste Oil]] in Finland and mining company [[AngloGold Ashanti]] in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lang |first=Olivia |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/davos/9379067.stm |title=BBC Davos Day three |publisher=BBC News |date=28 January 2011 |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Davos Man==

Davos Man is a [[neologism]] which refers to the global [[elite]] of [[wealthy]] men whose members view themselves as completely international.  [[Davos]] is an Alpine city in eastern [[Switzerland]] which became famous in the 1990s for hosting the World Economic Forum, an annual gathering of international politicians and financiers who represented a transnational elite. It is similar to the term ''Masters of the Universe'' attributed to influential financiers on Wall St.

Davos Men supposedly see their identity as a matter of personal choice, not an accident of birth. According to political scientist [[Samuel P. Huntington]], who is credited with inventing the phrase &quot;Davos Man&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Garton Ash. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1404411,00.html Davos man's death wish], ''The Guardian'', 3 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; they are people who &quot;have little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the élite's global operations&quot;. In his 2004 article &quot;Dead Souls: The Denationalization of the American Elite,&quot; he argues that this international perspective is a minority elitist position not shared by the nationalist majority of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Huntington. Dead Souls: The Denationalization of the American Elite], ''[[The National Interest]]'', Spring 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

John Fonte of the [[Hudson Institute]] has suggested that the transnational ideology of ''Davos Man'' represents a major challenge to [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s assertion that [[liberal democracy]] represents the fulfillment of [[The End of History and the Last Man]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/transnational_progressivism.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hernando de Soto Polar]] of the [[Institute for Liberty and Democracy]] attributes a similar concept to Henri Braudel, referring to it as the &quot;bell jar&quot;. Although internationally connected, each country's elite lives in a bell jar in the sense of being out of touch with its own populace. Their isolation fosters a tendency to be oblivious to the fate of their fellow citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Hernando de Soto. The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else. Basic Books. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Physical chemistry|physical chemist]] by professional background, Merkel entered politics in the wake of the [[Revolutions of 1989]] and briefly served as the deputy spokesperson for [[Lothar de Maizière]]'s democratically elected [[East Germany|East German]] government prior to the [[Reunification of Germany]]. Following reunification in 1990, she was elected to the [[Bundestag]], where she has represented the state of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] since. She served as [[Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth|Federal Minister for Women and Youth]] 1991–1994 and as [[Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety|Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety]] 1994–1998 in [[Helmut Kohl]]'s [[Cabinet Kohl IV|fourth]] and [[Cabinet Kohl V|fifth cabinet]]s. She was Secretary General of the CDU 1998–2000, and was elected chairperson in 2000. From 2002 to 2005, she was also chair of the [[CDU/CSU]] parliamentary coalition.

After her election as Chancellor following the [[German federal election, 2005|2005 federal election]], she led a [[Grand coalition (Germany)|grand coalition]] consisting of her own CDU party, its Bavarian sister party, the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] (CSU), and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), until 2009. In the [[German federal election, 2009|2009 federal election]], the CDU obtained the largest share of the votes, and formed a coalition government with the CSU and the liberal [[Freie Demokratische Partei|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP).&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCnewterm2&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8329490.stm  | title = Germany's Merkel begins new term | accessdate = 2009-11-01 | date = 2009-10-28 | publisher = BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Merkel was [[President of the European Council]] and chaired the [[G8]], the second woman (after [[Margaret Thatcher]]) to do so. She played a central role in the negotiation of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] and the [[Berlin Declaration (2007)|Berlin Declaration]]. Merkel is seen as playing a crucial role in managing the [[Late-2000s financial crisis|financial crisis]] at the European and international level, and has been referred to as &quot;the decider.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.npr.org/2011/12/08/143292255/can-angela-merkel-save-europe&lt;/ref&gt; In domestic policy, [[health care reform]] and problems concerning future [[energy development]] have been major issues of her tenure.

Angela Merkel has for several years been described as the world’s most powerful woman and as &quot;the ''de facto'' leader of the [[EU]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/8720698/Angela-Merkel-worlds-most-powerful-woman.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forbes.com/profile/angela-merkel/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Merkel was born Angela Dorothea Kasner in [[Hamburg]], [[West Germany]], the daughter of [[Horst Kasner]] (1926–2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsecho.de/news/ticker/Sa6pk0PGTGs/merkels_vater_gestorben_termine_abgesagt|title=Merkels Vater gestorben - Termine abgesagt|language=German|publisher=newsecho.de|date=2011-09-03|accessdate=2011-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[pastor]] and a native of Berlin, and his wife, Herlind (born 1928 in [[Free City of Danzig|Danzig]], as Herlind Jentzsch), a teacher of [[English language|English]] and [[Latin]]. Her mother was once a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Was an Angela Merkels Mutter vorbildlich ist| language = German | trans_title = | url = http://www.welt.de/politik/article2496274/Was-an-Angela-Merkels-Mutter-vorbildlich-ist.html| work = Welt Online| date = 26 September 2008 | accessdate = 31 July 2010 | quote = 'Nein, in der SPD bin ich nicht mehr.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In an interview with ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' in 2000, Merkel stated that she was one quarter [[Poles|Polish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-18124491.html |title=Mut zu Zwischentönen| language=German |publisher=Spiegel.de |date=2000-12-25 |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Preußische Allgemeine Zeitung]], attempting to establish if this referred to her grandparents on her mother's side, Willi Jentzsch and Gertrud Drange, reported that, according to their researches, they were both of German descent and lived in Danzig where Willi Jentzsch was a [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] teacher.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webarchiv-server.de/pin/archiv11/0320110122paz06.htm &lt;/ref&gt; She has a brother, Marcus (born 7 July 1957), and a sister, Irene (born 19 August 1964).

Merkel's father studied [[theology]] in [[Heidelberg]] and, afterwards, in Hamburg. In 1954 her father received a pastorate at the church in [[Quitzow]] (near [[Perleberg]] in [[Brandenburg]]), which then was in [[East Germany]], and the family moved to [[Templin]]. Thus Merkel grew up in the countryside {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Berlin]]. [[Gerd Langguth]], a former senior member of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, states in his book&lt;ref name=&quot;Langguth&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last = Langguth  | first = Gerd  | title = Angela Merkel  | origyear = 2005 | publisher = dtv | location = Munich | language = German| isbn =3-423-24485-2  | year = 2005| month = August}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the family's ability to travel freely from East to West Germany during the following years, as well as their possession of two automobiles, leads to the conclusion that Merkel's father had a &quot;sympathetic&quot; relationship with the communist regime, since such freedom and perquisites for a Christian pastor and his family would have been otherwise impossible in East Germany.

Like most pupils, Merkel was a member of the official, [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist]]-led youth movement [[Free German Youth|Free German Youth (FDJ)]]. However, she did not take part in the [[secular]] [[coming of age]] ceremony [[Jugendweihe]], which was common in East Germany, and was [[Confirmation (sacrament)#Lutheran view|confirmed]] instead.  Later, at the Academy of Sciences, she became a member of the FDJ district board and secretary for &quot;[[Agitprop]]&quot; (Agitation and Propaganda).  Merkel herself claimed that she was secretary for culture. When Merkel's onetime FDJ district chairman contradicted her, she insisted that: &quot;According to my memory, I was secretary for culture. But what do I know? I believe I won't know anything when I'm 80.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-67682698.html |title=Die Schläferin |language=[[German language|German]] |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=2009-11-09 |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Merkel's progress in the compulsory Marxism-Leninism course was graded only ''genügend'' (sufficient, passing grade) in 1983 and 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,675061,00.html |title=Glänzend in Physik, mäßig in der Ideologie |language=[[German language|German]] |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=2010-01-31 |quote=&quot;Nach meiner Erinnerung war ich Kultursekretärin. Aber was weiß ich denn? Ich glaube, wenn ich 80 bin, weiß ich gar nichts mehr&quot;, sagt sie.  |accessdate=2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At school, she learned to speak [[Russian language|Russian]] fluently, and was awarded prizes for her proficiency in Russian and Mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Langguth | first = Gerd | authorlink = Gerd Langguth | title = Angela Merkel | year = 2005 | month = August | publisher = DTV | language = German | isbn = 3423244852 | page = 50 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Merkel was educated in Templin and at the [[University of Leipzig]], where she studied [[physics]] from 1973 to 1978. While a student, she participated in the reconstruction of the ruin of the [[Moritzbastei]], a project students initiated to create their own club and recreation facility on campus. Such an initiative was unprecedented in the [[East Germany|GDR]] of that period, and initially resisted by the [[University of Leipzig]]. However, with backing of the local leadership of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] party, the project was allowed to proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/authoralbumbackground/3852/drogenwahn_auf_der_baustelle.html |title=Drogenwahn auf der Dauerbaustelle|language=German|publisher=Spiegel Online |date=2009-03-27 |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merkel worked and studied at the Central Institute for [[Physical chemistry|Physical Chemistry]] of the [[German Academy of Sciences Berlin|Academy of Sciences]] in [[Adlershof|Berlin-Adlershof]] from 1978 to 1990.  After being awarded a [[doctorate]] (''[[Dr. rer. nat.]]'') for her thesis on [[quantum chemistry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Merkel | first = Angela

In 1989, Merkel got involved in the growing [[democracy]] movement after the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]], joining the new party [[Demokratischer Aufbruch|Democratic Awakening]]. Following the [[East German general election, 1990|first (and only) democratic election]] of the East German state, she became the deputy spokesperson of the new pre-[[German reunification|unification]] caretaker government under [[Lothar de Maizière]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Langguth112&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last = Langguth  | first = Gerd  | title = Angela Merkel  | origyear = 2005 | publisher = dtv | location = Munich | language = German| isbn =3-423-24485-2 | pages = 112–137  | year = 2005| month = August}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Member of Bundestag and cabinet minister==
At the [[German federal election, 1990|first post-reunification general election]] in December 1990, she was elected to the Bundestag from the [[constituency]] [[Stralsund – Nordvorpommern – Rügen (electoral district)|Stralsund – Nordvorpommern – Rügen]], which is coextensive with the [[Districts of Germany|district]] of [[Vorpommern-Rügen]]. This has remained her electoral district until today. Her party merged with the west German CDU&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2010-10/kohl-in-berlin|title=Des Altkanzlers mahnende Worte|language=German|publisher=Zeit Online|date=2010-10-01|accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she became Minister for Women and Youth in [[Helmut Kohl]]'s 3rd cabinet. In 1994, she was made [[Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety|Minister for the Environment and Nuclear Safety]], which gave her greater political visibility and a platform on which to build her political career. As one of Kohl's protégées and his youngest cabinet minister, she was referred to by Kohl as &quot;''mein Mädchen''&quot; (&quot;my girl&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,357997,00.html|title=Kohls unterschätztes Mädchen|language=German|publisher=Spiegel Online|date=2005-05-30|accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leader of the opposition==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-0803-017, Lothar de Maiziere und Angela Merkel.jpg|thumb|Merkel (right) as deputy government spokesperson together with [[Lothar de Maizière]], August 1990]] 
When the Kohl government was [[German federal election, 1998|defeated in the 1998 general election]], Merkel was named Secretary-General of the CDU. In this position, Merkel oversaw a string of Christian Democrat election victories in six out of seven state elections in 1999 alone, breaking the SPD-Green coalition's hold on the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]], the legislative body representing the [[States of Germany|states]]. Following [[1999 CDU contributions scandal|a party financing scandal]], which compromised many leading figures of the CDU (most notably Kohl himself, who refused to reveal the donor of DM 2,000,000 claiming he had given his word of honour and the then party chairman [[Wolfgang Schäuble]], Kohl's hand-picked successor, who wasn't cooperative either), Merkel criticized her former mentor, Kohl, and advocated a fresh start for the party without him. She was elected to replace Schäuble, becoming the first female chair of her party, on 10 April 2000. Her election surprised many observers, as her personality offered a contrast to the party she had been chosen to lead; Merkel is a [[Protestant]], originating from predominantly Protestant northern Germany, while the CDU is a male-dominated, [[social conservative|socially conservative]] party with strongholds in western and southern Germany, and the Bavarian sister party, the CSU, has deep [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] roots.

Following Merkel's election as CDU leader, she enjoyed considerable popularity among the German population and was favoured by many Germans to become [[Gerhard Schröder|Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's]] challenger in the [[German federal election, 2002|2002 election]]. However, she did not receive enough support in her own party and particularly its sister party (the [[Bavaria]]n [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|Christian Social Union]], or CSU), and was subsequently out-manoeuvred politically by CSU leader [[Edmund Stoiber]], to whom she eventually ceded the privilege of challenging Schröder; however, he squandered a large lead in the opinion polls to lose the election by a razor-thin margin. After Stoiber's defeat in 2002, in addition to her role as CDU chairwoman, Merkel became leader of the conservative opposition in the lower house of the German parliament, the [[Bundestag]]. Her rival, [[Friedrich Merz]], who had held the post of parliamentary leader prior to the 2002 election, was eased out to make way for Merkel.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Merkel supported a substantial [[reform movement|reform]] agenda concerning [[Germany]]'s economic and social system and was considered to be more pro-[[market]] than her own party (the CDU); she advocated changes to German labour law, specifically removing barriers to laying off employees and increasing the allowed number of work hours in a week, arguing that existing laws made the country less competitive because companies cannot easily control labour costs at times when business is slow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,249207,00.html |title=Merkel fordert längere Arbeitszeit|language=German|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=2003-05-18|accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merkel argued for Germany's [[nuclear power]] to be phased out less quickly than the Schröder administration had planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP_Merkel_Nuclear_phase_out_is_wrong_1006081.html |title=Merkel: Nuclear phase-out is wrong|publisher=World Nuclear News|date=2008-06-10|accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merkel advocated a strong transatlantic partnership and German-American friendship. In the spring of 2003, defying strong public opposition, Merkel came out in favour of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S. invasion of Iraq]], describing it as &quot;unavoidable&quot; and accusing Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] of [[anti-Americanism]].  She criticised the government's support for the [[accession of Turkey to the European Union]] and favoured a &quot;[[privileged partnership]]&quot; instead. In doing so, she reflected public opinion that grew more hostile toward Turkish membership of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;Marlies Casier and Joost Jongerden, eds. ''Nationalisms and Politics in Turkey'' (2010) p 110&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise to power===
On 30 May 2005, Merkel won the CDU/CSU nomination as challenger to Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] in the [[German federal election, 2005|2005 national elections]]. Her party began the campaign with a 21 point lead over the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] in national [[opinion poll]]s, although her personal popularity lagged behind that of the [[incumbent]]. However, the CDU/CSU campaign suffered{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} when Merkel, having made economic competence central to the CDU's platform, confused [[gross income|gross]] and [[net income]] twice during a televised debate. She regained some momentum after she announced that she would appoint [[Paul Kirchhof]], a former judge at the German Constitutional Court and leading fiscal policy expert, as Minister of Finance.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Merkel and the CDU lost ground after Kirchhof proposed the introduction of a [[flat tax]] in Germany, again undermining the party's broad appeal on economic affairs and convincing many voters that the CDU's platform of deregulation was designed to benefit only the rich. This was compounded by Merkel proposing to increase [[VAT]] to reduce Germany's deficit and fill the gap in revenue from a flat tax. The SPD were able to increase their support simply by pledging not to introduce flat taxes or increase VAT. Although Merkel's standing recovered after she distanced herself from Kirchhof's proposals, she remained considerably less popular than Schröder, and the CDU's lead was down to 9% on the eve of the election.

On 18 September 2005, Merkel's CDU/CSU and Schröder's SPD went head-to-head in the national elections, with the CDU/CSU winning 35.3% (CDU 27.8%/CSU 7.5%) of the second votes to the SPD's 34.2%. Neither the SPD-Green coalition nor the CDU/CSU and its preferred coalition partners, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]], held enough seats to form a majority in the Bundestag, and both Schröder and Merkel claimed victory. A [[grand coalition]] between the CDU/CSU and SPD faced the challenge that both parties demanded the chancellorship. However, after three weeks of [[negotiation (process)|negotiations]], the two parties reached a deal whereby Merkel would become Chancellor and the SPD would hold 8 of the 16 seats in the cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4325600.stm |title=Merkel named as German chancellor|publisher=BBC News|date=2005-10-10|accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/10/13/germany.government.ap/ CNN.com] {{Dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition deal was approved by both parties at party conferences on 14 November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4434812.stm |title=German parties back new coalition |date=November 14, 2005 |work=BBC News |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Merkel was elected Chancellor by the majority of delegates (397 to 217) in the newly assembled Bundestag on 22 November 2005, but 51 members of the governing coalition voted against her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4458430.stm |title=Merkel becomes German chancellor |work=BBC News |date=November 22, 2005 |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports had indicated that the grand coalition would pursue a mix of policies, some of which differ from Merkel's political platform as leader of the opposition and candidate for Chancellor. The coalition's intent was to cut public spending whilst increasing [[VAT]] (from 16 to 19%), [[social insurance]] contributions and the top rate of [[income tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4429518.stm |title=German coalition poised for power |date=November 11, 2005 |work=BBC News |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merkel had stated that the main aim of her government would be to reduce unemployment, and that it is this issue on which her government will be judged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4431262.stm |title=Merkel defends German reform plan |work=BBC News |date=November 12, 2005 |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chancellor of Germany==

On 22 November 2005, Merkel assumed the office of Chancellor of Germany following a [[German federal election, 2005|stalemate election]] that resulted in a [[Grand coalition (Germany)|grand coalition]] with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]].  She was [[German federal election, 2009|re-elected in 2009]] with a larger majority and was able to form a governing coalition with the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]].

On 25 September 2007, Chancellor Angela Merkel met the [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] for &quot;''private and informal talks''&quot; in Berlin in the [[German Chancellery|Chancellery]] amid protest from [[China]]. China afterwards cancelled separate talks with German officials, including talks with Justice Minister [[Brigitte Zypries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://euronews.net/index.php?page=info&amp;article=444371&amp;lng=1 |title=Euronews.net, Merkel meets with the Dalai Lama |publisher=Euronews.net |date= |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Der Spiegel'' reported that tensions between Chancellor Merkel and U.S. President Barack Obama&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,632026,00.html |title='They're Not Getting any Warmer': Merkel Faces Difficult Talks in Washington – SPIEGEL ONLINE – News – International |publisher=Spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; were eased during a meeting between the two leaders in June 2009.  Commenting on a White House Press Conference held after the meeting, ''Spiegel'' stated, &quot;Of course the rather more reserved chancellor couldn't really keep up with [Obama's]...[[charm offensive]],&quot; but to reciprocate for Obama's &quot;good natured&quot; diplomacy, &quot;she gave it a go...by mentioning the experiences of Obama's sister in Heidelberg, making it clear that she had read his autobiography&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,632961,00.html |title=A Trans-Atlantic Show of Friendship: Obama Praises His 'Friend Chancellor Merkel' – SPIEGEL ONLINE – News – International |publisher=Spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russia====
In 2006 Merkel expressed concern for [[Russia in the European energy sector|overreliance on Russian energy]], but she received little support from others in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/2008/0306/p06s01-wogn.html|title=Dependence on Russian gas worries some – but not all – European countries|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|date=2008-03-06|accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iran====
According to the news agency ''Mehr'' (as reported in the ''Mail &amp; Guardian Online'' and ''Deutsche Welle'', quoting ''AFP''), in August 2006, Merkel received a letter from President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] of [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ahmadinejad Claims Holocaust Invented to Embarrass Germany |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2149241,00.html |work=Deutsche Welle |date=2006-08-28 |accessdate=2008-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=ARESU |last=EQBALI |title=Ahmadinejad: Holocaust was made up |url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2006-08-28-ahmadinejad-holocaust-was-made-up |work=Mail and Guardian Online |date=2006-08-28 |accessdate=2008-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the reports, Merkel said that the letter contained &quot;unacceptable&quot; criticism of [[Israel]] and &quot;put in question&quot; the Jewish state's right to exist, and that therefore she would not formally respond to the letter.

====Israel====
On 16 March 2008, Merkel arrived in Israel to mark the 60th [[Yom Ha'atzmaut|anniversary of the Jewish state]]. She was greeted at the airport by Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]], an honor guard and many of the country's political and religious leaders, including most of the Israeli Cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/03/16/news/mideast.php|title=Chancellor of Germany goes to Israel|publisher=The New York Times|date=2008-03-16|accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until then, US President [[George W.

Merkel has supported Israeli diplomatic initiatives, opposing the Palestinian bid for membership at the UN. However, Merkel was offended when settlement building continued beyond the Green Line&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=202704&lt;/ref&gt;, and felt personally betrayed by the Israeli government's behavior. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=206071&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic and financial policy===
--&gt;

====Liquidity crisis====
Following [[Liquidity crisis of September 2008|major falls in worldwide stock markets in September 2008]], the German government stepped in to assist the [[mortgage loan|mortgage]] company [[Hypo Real Estate]] with a bailout which was agreed on October 6, with German banks to contribute €30 billion and the [[Deutsche Bundesbank|Bundesbank]] €20 billion to a credit line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=amxJTktF7JMs&amp;refer=home|title=Hypo Real Gets EU50 Billion Government-Led Bailout|last=Parkin|first=Brian|coauthors=Suess, Oliver|date=6 October 2008|work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 October 2008, a Saturday, following the [[Government of Ireland|Irish Government's]] decision to guarantee all deposits in private savings accounts, a move she strongly criticized,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2008/10/05/ap5510085.html|title=Germany guarantees all private bank accounts|publisher=Forbes.com|accessdate=2008-10-06|deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merkel said there were no plans for the German Government to do the same. The following day, Merkel stated that the government would guarantee private savings account deposits, after all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/05/AR2008100500816.html?hpid=sec-business|title=Germany to guarantee Private Bank Accounts|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=2008-10-06 | first=Craig | last=Whitlock | date=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, two days later, on 6 October 2008, it emerged that the pledge was simply a political move that would not be backed by legislation.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot; /&gt; Other European governments eventually either raised the limits or promised to guarantee savings in full.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7654182.stm|title=Bank uncertainty hits UK shares|publisher=BBC| accessdate=2008-10-06 | date=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
In 2011,&lt;ref name=&quot;timesofindia.indiatimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Angela-Merkel-in-India-for-joint-cabinet-meet/articleshow/8659994.cms|title=Angela Merkel in India for joint cabinet meet|publisher=The Times of India|date=2011-05-31|accessdate=2011-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; India became the first Asian country to hold a joint cabinet meeting with Germany when Merkel visited.&lt;ref name=&quot;timesofindia.indiatimes.com&quot;/&gt;

===Failure of multiculturalism===
In October 2010 Merkel told a meeting of younger members of her conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party at [[Potsdam]] that attempts to build a [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] society in Germany had &quot;utterly failed&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11559451 | work=BBC News | title=Merkel says German multicultural society has failed | date=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating: &quot;The concept that we are now living side by side and are happy about it does not work&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20101017/wl_afp/germanymuslimreligionimmigration ]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that &quot;we feel attached to the Christian concept of mankind, that is what defines us.

This has added to a growing debate within Germany&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11532699 | work=BBC News | title=Germany's charged immigration debate | date=2010-10-17|accessdate=2011-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the levels of immigration, its effect on Germany and the degree to which Muslim immigrants have integrated into German society.

===Approval===
Midway through her second term, Merkel's approval plummeted in the country, resulting in heavy losses in state elections for her party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/21/angela-merkel-crushed-hamburg-polls|title=Angela Merkel's party crushed in Hamburg poll|publisher=The Guardian|date=2011-02-21|accessdate=2011-08-23|location=London|first=Helen|last=Pidd}}&lt;/ref&gt; A poll in August 2011 found her coalition with only 36% support compared to a rival coalition which had 51%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zimbio.com/Chancellor+Angela+Merkel/articles/tvb0mRYv0RF/German+opposition+hits+11+year+high+polls|title=German opposition hits 11-year high in polls|publisher=France24|date=2011-08-05|accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she scored well on her handling of the recent euro crisis (69% rated her performance as good rather than poor), and her approval rating reached an all-time high of 77% in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/union-dank-merkel-im-umfrage-aufwind-1784909.html|title=Union dank Merkel im Umfrage-Aufwind|publisher=Stern.de|date=2012-02-10|accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cabinets==

The [[Cabinet Merkel I|first cabinet of Angela Merkel]] was sworn in at 16:00 [[Central European Time|CET]], on 22 November 2005.

On 31 October 2005, after the defeat of his favoured candidate for the position of Secretary General of the SPD, [[Franz Müntefering]] indicated that he would resign as Chairman of the party in November, which he did. Ostensibly responding to this, [[Edmund Stoiber]] (CSU), who was originally nominated for the Economics and Technology post, announced his withdrawal on 1 November 2005. While this was initially seen as a blow to Merkel's attempt at forming a viable coalition and cabinet, the manner in which Stoiber withdrew earned him much ridicule and severely undermined his position as a Merkel rival. Separate conferences of the CDU, CSU, and SPD approved the proposed Cabinet on 14 November 2005

The [[Cabinet Merkel II|second cabinet of Angela Merkel]] was sworn in on 28 October 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;cabinet2009&quot;&gt;Penfold, Chuck (2009-10-30). Merkel's new cabinet sworn in.

==Personal life==
In 1977, Angela Kasner married physics student Ulrich Merkel.

==Honours==

In 2006, Angela Merkel was awarded the [[Vision for Europe Award]] for her contribution toward greater European integration. In 2007, Merkel was awarded an [[honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afhu.org/site/press_releases/news_merkel.htm American Friends of the Hebrew University]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.huji.ac.il/htbin/hon_doc/doc_search.pl |title=Honorary Doctorates – The Hebrew University of Jerusalem |publisher=.huji.ac.il |date= |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2006, the Italian President of the Republic gave the German Chancellor the recognition of ''Dama di Gran Croce Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana''.

==Comparisons==
As a female politician from a [[centre right]] party who is also a scientist, Merkel has been compared by many in the English-language press to former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Some have referred to her as &quot;[[Iron Lady]]&quot;, &quot;Iron Girl&quot;, and even &quot;The Iron Frau&quot; (all alluding to Thatcher, whose nickname was &quot;The Iron Lady&quot;—Thatcher also has a science degree: an Oxford University degree in chemistry). Political commentators have debated the precise extent to which their agendas are similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2122001/ |title=Is Angela Merkel the next Maggie Thatcher? |work=Slate |date=July 5, 2005 |last=Risen |first=Clay |publisher=[[Slate (magazine)]] |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in her tenure, Merkel acquired the [[nickname]] &quot;''Mutti''&quot; (a familiar form of 'mother'), said by ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' to refer to an idealised mother figure from the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,659018,00.html |title=Merkel's Dream of a Place in the History Books |last=Kurbjuweit |first=Dirk |date=11 March 2009 |publisher=Spiegel Online International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being the first female German chancellor, the first to represent a Federal Republic of Germany that included the former East Germany (though she was born in the West and moved to the East a few weeks after her birth, when her father decided to return to East Germany as  a Lutheran pastor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Langguth | first = Gerd | title = Angela Merkel | year = 2005 | month = August | publisher = DTV | location = Munich | language = German | isbn = 3-423-24495-2 |page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and the youngest German chancellor since the Second World War, Merkel is also the first born after World War II, and the first chancellor of the Federal Republic with a background in natural sciences. She studied physics; her predecessors studied law, business or history or were military officers, among others.

[[Forbes]] has named her the fourth most powerful person in the world as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/powerful-people/list/|title=The World's Most Powerful People|publisher=Forbes|date=|accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Merkel has been criticised for being personally present and involved at the M100 Media Award handover&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-51367120100908 | work=Reuters | title=Merkel honours Mohammad cartoonist at press award | date=2010-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Danish [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|cartoonist]] [[Kurt Westergaard]]. This happened at a time of fierce emotional debate in Germany over disparaging remarks about Muslim immigrants made by the former [[Deutsche Bundesbank]] executive [[Thilo Sarrazin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,714643-2,00.html The Sarrazin Debate: Germany Is Becoming Islamophobic – SPIEGEL ONLINE – News – International].

A ZMD spokesman, Aiman Mazyek, told public broadcaster Deutschlandradio that the Chancellor was honouring someone &quot;who in our eyes kicked our prophet, and therefore kicked all Muslims&quot;. He said giving Mr Westergaard the prize in a &quot;highly charged and heated time&quot; was &quot;highly problematic&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11236158 | work=BBC News | title=Merkel honours Danish Muhammad cartoonist Westergaard | date=2010-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the left party&lt;ref&gt;[http://die-linke.de/nc/die_linke/nachrichten/detail/artikel/merkels-affront-gegen-muslime/ DIE LINKE: Merkels Affront gegen Muslime].

It was true that the right to freedom of expression also applies to cartoons, she said. &quot;But if a chancellor also makes a speech on top of that, it serves to heat up the debate.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,716503,00.html Award for Danish Muhammad Cartoonist: Merkel Defends Press Freedom, Condemns Koran-Burning – SPIEGEL ONLINE – News – International].

The ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine]]'' newspaper wrote: &quot;This will probably be the most explosive appointment of her chancellorship so far.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/s/Rub9B4326FE2669456BAC0CF17E0C7E9105/Doc~E6762D4CF046141829F1A9533368C843E~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html Ehrung des Mohammed-Karikaturisten: Angela Merkels Risiko – Integration – Feuilleton]. Faz.Net (2010-09-08). Retrieved on 2011-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have praised Merkel and called it a brave and bold move for the cause of freedom of speech.

In September 2010, due to a debate of integration, Merkel said to the [[Frankfurter Allgemeine]] newspaper that &quot;Germans will see more mosques&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article9716872/Merkel-Deutsche-werden-mehr-Moscheen-sehen.html Islam: Merkel – Deutsche werden mehr Moscheen sehen – Nachrichten Politik – Deutschland – WELT ONLINE].

{{PoliticsGermany}}
The '''Bundestag''' (Federal [[diet (assembly)|Diet]]; {{IPA-de|ˈbʊndəstaːk|pron}}) is a federal legislative body in [[Germany]]. In practice Germany is governed by a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[legislature]], of which the Bundestag serves as the [[lower house]] and the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] the [[upper house]]. The Bundestag was established by the German [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] of 1949, as the successor to the earlier [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]. [[Norbert Lammert]] is the current [[President of the Bundestag]].

==History==
With the dissolution of the [[German Confederation]] in 1866 and the founding of the [[German Empire]] ([[Deutsches Reich]]) in 1871, the Reichstag was established as the German parliament in Berlin. Two decades later, the current parliament building was erected. The Reichstag delegates were elected by direct and equal male suffrage (and not the three-class electoral system prevailing in Prussia until 1918). The Reichstag did not participate in the appointment of the Chancellor until the parliamentary reforms of October 1918. After the Revolution of November 1918 and the establishment of the Weimar Constitution, women were given the right to vote for (and serve in) the Reichstag, and the parliament could use the no-confidence vote to force the chancellor or any cabinet member to resign. In March 1933, one month after the [[Reichstag fire]], the then president, Paul von Hindenburg, a retired war hero, gave Hitler ultimate power through Enabling Act of 1933, he remained at the post of Federal Government Chancellor (though he called himself the Führer). After this the Reichstag met only rarely to unanimously rubber-stamp the decisions of the government. It last convened on 26 April 1942.

With the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|new constitution of 1949]], the Bundestag was established as the new (West) German parliament.  Because [[West Berlin]] was not officially under the jurisdiction of the Constitution and because of the [[Cold War]], the Bundestag met in [[Bonn]] in several different buildings, including (provisionally) a former water works facility. In addition, citizens of West Berlin were unable to vote in elections to the Bundestag, and were instead represented by 20 non-voting delegates, indirectly elected by the city's [[Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin|House of Representatives]].

The [[Bundeshaus (Bonn)|Bundeshaus in Bonn]] is the former Parliament Building of Germany. The sessions of the German Bundestag were held there from 1949 until its move to Berlin in 1999. Today it houses the [[International Congress Centre Bundeshaus Bonn]] and in the north areas the branch office of the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] (Upper House). The southern areas became part of German offices for the [[United Nations]] in 2008.

The former [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] building housed a history exhibition (Fragen an die deutsche Geschichte) and served occasionally as a conference center. The Reichstag building was also occasionally used as a venue for sittings of the Bundestag and its committees and the [[Bundesversammlung (Germany)|Bundesversammlung]], the body which elects the German Federal President. However the Soviets harshly protested against the use of the Reichstag building by institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and tried to disturb the sittings by flying supersonic jets close to the building.

Since 1999, the German parliament has again assembled in [[Berlin]] in its original [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]], which dates from the 1890s and underwent a significant renovation under the lead of British architect [[Sir Norman Foster]]. Parliamentary committees and subcommittees, public hearings and faction meetings take place in three auxiliary buildings, which surround the Reichstag building: the [[Jakob-Kaiser-Haus]], [[Paul-Löbe-Haus]] and [[Marie-Elisabeth-Lüders-Haus]].

In 2005, a small aircraft crashed close to the German parliament. It was then decided to ban private air traffic over Central Berlin.

==Tasks==
Together with the [[Bundesrat (Germany)|Bundesrat]], the Bundestag is the [[legislative branch]] of the [[Politics of Germany|German political system]].

Although most legislation is initiated by the executive branch, the Bundestag considers the legislative function its most important responsibility, concentrating much of its energy on assessing and amending the government's legislative program. The committees (see below) play a prominent role in this process. Plenary sessions provide a forum for members to engage in public debate on legislative issues before them, but they tend to be well attended only when significant legislation is being considered.

The Bundestag members are the only federal officials directly elected by the public; the Bundestag in turn elects the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] and, in addition, exercises oversight of the executive branch on issues of both substantive policy and routine administration. This check on executive power can be employed through binding legislation, public debates on government policy, investigations, and direct questioning of the chancellor or cabinet officials. For example, the Bundestag can conduct a question hour ''(Fragestunde),'' in which a government representative responds to a previously submitted written question from a member. Members can ask related questions during the question hour. The questions can concern anything from a major policy issue to a specific constituent's problem. Use of the question hour has increased markedly over the past forty years, with more than 20,000 questions being posed during the 1987-90 term. Understandably, the opposition parties are active in exercising the parliamentary right to scrutinize government actions.

One striking difference when comparing the Bundestag with the [[British Parliament]] is the lack of time spent on serving constituents in Germany. This is in part due to Germany's electoral system. A practical constraint on the expansion of constituent service is the limited personal staff of Bundestag deputies. Despite these constraints especially those deputies that are elected directly normally try to keep close contact with their constituents and to help them with their problems, particularly when they are related to federal policies or agencies.

Constituent service does also take place in the form of the Petition Committee. In 2004, the Petition Committee received over 18,000 complaints from citizens and was able to negotiate a mutually satisfactory solution to more than half of them. In 2005, as a pilot of the potential of [[internet petition]]s, a version of [[e-Petitioner]] was produced for the Bundestag. This was a collaborative project involving The [[Scottish Parliament]], [[International Teledemocracy Centre]] and the Bundestag ‘Online Services Department’.  The system was formally launched on 1 September 2005, and in 2008 the Bundestag moved to a new system based on its evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tab.fzk.de/de/brief/brief32.pdf |title=''Öffentliche Petitionen beim deutschen Bundestag - erste Ergebnisse der Evaluation des Modellversuchs'' = An Evaluation Study of Public Petitions at the German Parliament'' |accessdate=2009-06-16 |last=Trenel|first=M.|work=TAB Brief Nr 32 |publisher=Deutscher Bundestag |year=2007 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election==
[[File:Vladimir Putin in Germany 25-27 September 2001-14.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vladimir Putin]] addresses the Bundestag]]
Members serve four-year terms; elections are held every four years, or earlier in the relatively rare case that the Bundestag is dissolved prematurely by the [[President of Germany|president]]. The Bundestag can be dissolved by the president on the recommendation of the chancellor if the latter has lost a vote of confidence in the Bundestag. This has happened three times: 1972 under Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]], 1983 under Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] and 2005 under Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]].

All candidates must be at least eighteen years old; there are no term limits. The election uses the [[Mixed member proportional representation|MMP electoral system]]. In addition, the Bundestag has a minimum threshold of either 5% of the national party vote or three (directly elected) constituency representatives for a [[political party|party]] to gain additional representation through the system of proportional representation.

Thus, small minority parties cannot easily enter the Bundestag and prevent the formation of stable majority governments as they could under the Weimar constitution. Since 1961, only two new parties ([[Bündnis 90/Die Grünen]] and [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|PDS]]/[[Die Linke]]) have entered the Bundestag.

The most recent election, the [[German federal election, 2009]], was held on September 27, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawley&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,601451,00.html|title=Political Landscape in Flux ahead of 2009 Votes|last=Hawley|first=Charles|date=15 January 2009|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=2009-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distribution of seats in the Bundestag===
[[File:Bundestagswahl 05 stimmzett.jpg|thumb|right|Bundestag ballot: constituency vote on left, party list (showing top five list candidates) vote on right]]
Half of the Members of the Bundestag are elected directly from 299 constituencies ([[first-past-the-post system]]), the other half are elected from the parties’ Land lists in such a way as to achieve [[proportional representation]] for the total Bundestag (if possible).

Accordingly, each voter has two votes in the elections to the Bundestag. The first vote, allowing voters to elect their local representatives to the Bundestag, decides which candidates are sent to Parliament from the constituencies.

The second vote is cast for a party list; it determines the relative strengths of the parties represented in the Bundestag.

At least 598 Members of the Bundestag are elected in this way.  Parties that gain more than 5% of the second votes or win at least 3 direct mandates are allocated seats in the Bundestag in proportion to the number of votes it has received ([[d'Hondt method]] until 1987, [[largest remainder method]] until the 2005 election, now [[Sainte-Laguë method]]).  When the total number of mandates gained by a party has been determined, they are distributed between the Land lists. The distribution of the seats of that party to the 16 Lands is proportional to that party's second vote results in the Lands.  The first of the mandates allocated to each Land go to the candidates who have won direct mandates in that Land.  The rest are assigned in order to the candidates on the Land list put forward before the election.

In addition to this, there are certain circumstances in which some candidates win what are known as [[overhang seat]]s when the seats are being distributed.  If a party has gained more direct mandates in a Land than it is entitled to according to the results of the second vote, it does not forfeit these mandates because all directly elected candidates are guaranteed a seat in the Bundestag.

==Organization==
[[File:M E Lueders Haus 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The ''Marie-Elisabeth-Lüders-Haus'', one of the official buildings of the complex]]

===Parliamentary groups===

The most important organizational structures within the Bundestag are [[fraction (politics)|parliamentary groups]] (''Fraktionen''; sing. ''Fraktion''), which are formed by political parties represented in the chamber which incorporate more than 5% of the Bundestag legislators; [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]] have always formed a single united ''Fraktion''. The size of a party's ''Fraktion'' determines the extent of its representation on legislative committees, the time slots allotted for speaking, the number of committee chairs it can hold, and its representation in executive bodies of the Bundestag. The ''Fraktionen,'' not the members, receive the bulk of government funding for legislative and administrative activities.

The leadership of each ''Fraktion'' consists of a parliamentary party leader, several deputy leaders, and an executive committee. The leadership's major responsibilities are to represent the ''Fraktion,'' enforce party discipline, and orchestrate the party's parliamentary activities. The members of each ''Fraktion'' are distributed among [[working group]]s focused on specific policy-related topics such as social policy, economics, and foreign policy. The ''Fraktion'' meets every Tuesday afternoon in the weeks in which the Bundestag is in session to consider legislation before the Bundestag and formulate the party's position on it.

Parties which do not fulfill the criterion for being a ''Fraktion'' but have at least three seats by direct elections (i.e. which have at least three MPs representing a certain electoral district) in the Bundestag can be granted the status of a ''group'' of the Bundestag. This applied to the [[Left Party (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]] (PDS) from 1990-1998. This status entails some privileges which are in general less than those of a ''Fraktion''. In the current Bundestag, there are no such groups (the PDS had only two MPs in parliament until 2005 and could thus not even considered a group anymore; the party has now returned to the Bundestag with full ''Fraktion'' status).

===Executive bodies===

The Bundestag's executive bodies include the [[Council of Elders of the Bundestag (Germany)|Council of Elders]] and the [[Presidium of the Bundestag|Presidium]]. The council consists of the Bundestag leadership, together with the most senior representatives of each ''fraktion'', with the number of these representatives tied to the strength of the Parliamentary groups in the chamber. The council is the coordination hub, determining the daily legislative agenda and assigning committee chairpersons based on Parliamentary group representation. The council also serves as an important forum for interparty negotiations on specific legislation and procedural issues. The Presidium is responsible for the routine administration of the Bundestag, including its clerical and research activities. It consists of the chamber's president (usually elected from the largest ''fraktion'') and vice presidents (one from each ''fraktion'').

===Committees===

Most of the legislative work in the Bundestag is the product of standing committees, which exist largely unchanged throughout one legislative period.  The number of committees approximates the number of federal ministries, and the titles of each are roughly similar (e.g., defense, agriculture, and labor). Between 1987 and 1990, the term of the eleventh Bundestag, there were twenty-one standing committees. The distribution of committee chairs and the membership of each committee reflect the relative strength of the various Parliamentary groups in the chamber. In the eleventh Bundestag, the [[Christian-Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]/[[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]] chaired eleven committees, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] eight, the [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|FDP]] one, and the environmentalist party, the [[German Green Party|Greens]] (Die Grünen), one. Members of the opposition party can chair a significant number of standing committees. These committees have either a small staff or no staff at all.

==Principle of discontinuation==
As is the case with some other parliaments, the Bundestag is subject to the ''principle of discontinuation'', meaning that a newly elected Bundestag is legally regarded to be a body and entity completely different from the previous Bundestag. This leads to the result, that any motion, application or action submitted to the previous Bundestag, e.g. a bill referred to the Bundestag by the Federal Government, is regarded as completed by non-decision (German terminology: “''Die Sache fällt der Diskontinuität anheim''”). Thus any bill that has not been decided upon by the beginning of the new electoral period must to be brought up by the government again, if it aims to uphold the motion, this procedure in effect delaying the passage of the bill. Furthermore, any newly elected Bundestag will have to freshly decide on the rules of procedure (''Geschäftsordnung''), which is done by a formal decision of taking over such rules from the preceding ''Bundestag'' by reference.

Any Bundestag is considered dissolved only once a newly elected Bundestag has actually gathered in order to constitute itself (Article&amp;nbsp;39 sec.&amp;nbsp;1 sentence&amp;nbsp;2 of the Basic Law), which has to happen within 30 days of its election (Article&amp;nbsp;39 sec.&amp;nbsp;2 of the Basic Law). Thus, it may happen (and has happened) that the old Bundestag gathers and makes decisions even after the election of a new Bundestag that has not gathered in order to constitute itself. For example, elections to the 16th Bundestag took place on 18 September 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/wahlen/pm-wahl-16-dbt/pd040211.htm |title=Press Release: ''Verkürzte Fristen zur vorgezogenen Neuwahl des Deutschen Bundestages'' |accessdate=2008-10-20 |work=www.bundeswahlleiter.de |publisher=[[Federal Returning Officer|Bundeswahlleiter]] = ''Federal Director for Elections'' ([[Federal Returning Officer]]) |date= 2005-07-25}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the 15th Bundestag still convened after election day to make some decisions on German military engagement abroad,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btp/15/15187.pdf |title=''Stenographischer Bericht der 187.

The '''Chancellor of Germany''' is the [[head of government]] of [[Germany]]. The official title in [[German language|German]] is ''Bundeskanzler(-in)'' (literally, Federal Chancellor), often shortened to ''Kanzler(-in)''.

In [[Politics of Germany|German politics]] the ''Chancellor'' is equivalent to that of a [[Prime Minister]] in many other countries. The German term directly equivalent of Prime Minister, ''Ministerpräsident'', is used for the heads of government of most [[States of Germany|German states]] (referred to in [[German language|German]] as ''Länder'', literally &quot;countries&quot;) as well as foreign countries.

The current Chancellor is [[Angela Merkel]], who was re-elected in 2009 after her first election in 2005. She is the first [[female]] Chancellor. In German she is thus known as ''Bundeskanzlerin''. That particular word was never used officially before Merkel, but it is a grammatically regular formation of a noun denoting a female.

The modern office of Chancellor evolved from the position created for [[Otto von Bismarck]] in the [[North German Confederation]] in 1867; the Confederation evolved into a German nation-state with the 1871 [[Unification of Germany]]. The role of the Chancellor has varied greatly throughout Germany's modern history. Today, the Chancellor is widely considered to be the country's effective leader.

==Historical overview==
{{PoliticsGermany}}
The office of Chancellor has a long history, stemming back to the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The title was at times used in several states of German-speaking Europe. The modern office of Chancellor was established with the [[North German Confederation]], of which [[Otto von Bismarck]] became Chancellor in 1867. After the [[Unification of Germany]] in 1871, the office became known in German as ''Reichskanzler'', although it continued to be referred to as Chancellor in English. With Germany's constitution of 1949, the title ''Bundeskanzler'' was revived in German.

During the various eras, the role of the Chancellor has varied. From 1871 to 1918, the Chancellor was only responsible to the [[Emperor of Germany|Emperor]]. With the constitutional reform in 1918, the Parliament was granted the right to dismiss the Chancellor. According to the [[Weimar Constitution]] of 1919, the Chancellor was appointed by the President and responsible to Parliament. After the death of [[Paul von Hindenburg|President Hindenburg]], the Weimar Constitution was effectively set aside during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi dictatorship]]. The [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|1949 constitution]] gave the Chancellor greater powers than during the [[Weimar Republic]], while diminishing the role of the President. Germany is today often referred to as a &quot;chancellor democracy&quot;, reflecting the ''[[de facto]]'' role of the Chancellor as the country's chief executive.

Since 1867, [[List of Chancellors of Germany|33 individuals]] have served as heads of government of Germany or its predecessor, the North German Confederation, most of them with the title Chancellor.
Due to his administrative tasks, the head of the [[clergy|clerics]] at the chapel of an [[Kaiserpfalz|Imperial palace]] during the [[Carolingian Empire]] was called [[Chancellor]] (from {{lang-la|cancellarius}}). The chapel's college acted as the Emperor's [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]] issuing deeds and [[capitulary|capitularies]]. Since the days of [[Louis the German]], the [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Archbishop of Mainz]] was ''[[ex officio]]'' German [[Archchancellor]], a position he held until the end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806, while ''de jure'' the [[Electorate of Cologne|Archbishop of Cologne]] was Chancellor of [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Italy]] and the [[Electorate of Trier|Archbishop of Trier]] of [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundy]]. These three [[Prince-Bishop|Prince-Archbishops]] were also [[Prince-elector]]s of the Empire electing the [[King of the Romans]]. Already in medieval times the German Chancellor had political power like Archbishop [[Willigis]] (Archchancellor 975–1011, regent for King [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III of Germany]] 991–994) or [[Rainald of Dassel|Rainald von Dassel]] (Chancellor 1156–1162 and 1166–1167) under Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]].

In 1559 Emperor [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] established the agency of an Imperial chancellery (''Reichshofkanzlei'') at the Vienna [[Hofburg Palace]], headed by a Vice-Chancellor under the nominal authority of the Mainz archbishop. Upon the 1620 [[Battle of White Mountain]], Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] created the office of an [[Archduchy of Austria|Austrian]] Court Chancellor in charge of the internal and foreign affairs of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. From 1753 onwards, the office of an Austrian State Chancellor was held by Prince [[Wenzel Anton, Prince of Kaunitz-Rietberg|Kaunitz]]. The Imperial chancellery lost its importance, and from the days of [[Maria Theresa]] and [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] merely existed on paper. After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, Prince [[Metternich]] served as State Chancellor of the [[Austrian Empire]] (1821-1848), likewise Prince [[Karl August von Hardenberg|Hardenberg]] acted as [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] chancellor (1810-1822).

From 1867 to 1871 the title ''Bundeskanzler'' (federal chancellor) was again used in the [[German language]], during the time of the [[North German Confederation]]. From 1871 to 1945, the office was named ''Reichskanzler'' (Imperial Chancellor). Since 1949 the formal title of the office in the German language is once again ''Bundeskanzler''.

In the now defunct [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR, East Germany), which existed from 7 October 1949 to 3 October 1990 (when the territory of the former GDR was reunified with the Federal Republic of Germany), the position of Chancellor did not exist. The equivalent position was called either '''Minister President''' ''(Ministerpräsident)'' or '''Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR''' ''(Vorsitzender des [[Ministerrat]]s der DDR)''. (See [[Leaders of East Germany]].)

==Chancellor of the North German Confederation (1867–1871)==
The head of the federal government of the [[North German Confederation]], which was created on 1 July 1867, had the title ''Bundeskanzler''. The only person to hold the office was [[Otto von Bismarck]], the [[Prime Minister of Prussia]].

The King of Prussia was [[Coronation|crowned]] as German Emperor at the [[Palace of Versailles]] on 18 January 1871, however, the North German Confederation did not cease to exist until the [[Constitution of the German Empire|1871 Constitution of Germany]] went into force on 16 April. Bismarck hence remained Chancellor of the Confederation until that date. During these months, the North German Confederation was also referred to as the German Confederation, after the South German states (excluding Austria) had joined the confederation.

The Chancellor was appointed by the [[King of Prussia]] in his capacity as President of the North German Confederation. His role and powers were very similar to that of the office of Chancellor of Germany from 1871.

==Chancellor of the German Empire (1871–1918)==
In the 1871 [[German Empire]], the Chancellor served both as the Emperor's first minister, and as presiding officer of the [[Bundesrat (Germany)|Bundesrat]], the upper chamber of the German parliament. He was neither elected by nor responsible to Parliament (the ''[[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]''). Instead, the Chancellor was appointed by the Emperor.

The Federal Government consisted of
* a federal council (Bundesrat), consisting of representatives of the federal states and presided over by the King of Prussia
* a parliament, called the Reichstag
* a rudimentary federal executive, led by the Prussian [[Prime Minister]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] as Federal Chancellor in a [[personal union]].

Technically, the foreign ministers of the empire's states instructed their states' deputies to the Federal Council (Bundesrat) and therefore outranked the Chancellor. For this reason, Bismarck continued to serve as both prime minister and foreign minister of Prussia for virtually his entire tenure as chancellor of the empire, since he wanted to continue to exercise this power. Since Berlin controlled 17 votes in the Bundesrat, Bismarck could effectively control the proceedings by making deals with the smaller states.

The term Chancellor signalled the seemingly low priority of this institution compared to the governments of the states, because the new Chancellor of the Federation should not be a fully fledged prime minister, in contrast to the heads of the federal states. The title of Chancellor additionally symbolized a strong monarchic-bureaucratic and ultimately antiparliamentary component, as in the Prussian tradition of for instance [[Karl August von Hardenberg|von Hardenberg]].

In both of these aspects, the executive of the Federation resp. the Empire as it was formed in 1867/71 was deliberately different from the Imperial Ministry of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|revolutionary years 1848/49]], which had been led by a Prime Minister, who was elected by the [[National Assembly]].

In 1871, the concept of the federal chancellor was transferred to the executive of the newly formed German Empire, which now also contained the South German states. Here too, the terms of Chancellor and Federal Agency (as opposed to Ministry or Government) suggested an (apparent) lower priority of the federal executive as compared to the governments of the federal states. For this reason, neither the Chancellor nor the leaders of the imperial departments under his command used the title of [[Minister (government)|Minister]] until 1918.

The constitution of Germany was amended on 29 October 1918, when the Parliament was given the right to dismiss the Chancellor. However, the change could not prevent the outbreak of the revolution a few days later.

==Revolutionary period (1918–1919)==
On 9 November 1918, Chancellor [[Max von Baden]] handed over his office to [[Friedrich Ebert]]. Ebert continued to serve as Head of Government during the three months between the end of the German Empire in November 1918 and the first gathering of the National Assembly in February 1919, but did not use the title of Chancellor.

During that time, Ebert also served as Chairman of the ''Council of the People's Delegates'', until 29 December 1918 together with the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|Independent Social Democrat]] [[Hugo Haase]].

==Chancellor of the Weimar Republic (1919–1933)==
The office of Chancellor was continued in the [[Weimar Republic]]. The Chancellor was appointed by the President and was responsible to the Reichstag.

Under the Weimar Republic, the Chancellor was a fairly weak figure. Much like his [[Prime Minister of France|French counterpart]], he served as little more than a chairman. Cabinet decisions were made by majority vote. In fact many of the Weimar governments depended highly on the cooperation of the President, due to the difficulty of finding a majority in Parliament.

==Chancellor of the Third Reich (1933–1945)==
[[Adolf Hitler]] became Chancellor of Germany in January 1933, a point which historians agree marks the beginning of the [[Third Reich]]. Upon taking office Hitler immediately began accumulating power and changing the nature of the Chancellory. After only two months in office, and following the [[Reichstag fire|burning]] of the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] building, the Reichstag body passed the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] which gave the Chancellor full legislative powers for a period of four years – the Chancellor could introduce any law without consulting Parliament. The Chancellorship grew greater still in August 1934 when the incumbent [[President of Germany|President]] [[Paul von Hindenburg]] died. Hitler used the Enabling Act to merge the office of Chancellor with that of President to create a new office, [[Führer]]; although the offices were merged, Hitler continued to be addressed as &quot;[[Führer]] und Reichskanzler&quot; indicating that the Head of State and Head of Government were still separate positions albeit held by the same man. This separation was made more evident when in April 1945 Hitler gave instruction that upon his death the office of Führer would dissolve and there would be a new President and Chancellor. On 30 April 1945, Hitler committed suicide and was briefly succeeded as Chancellor by [[Joseph Goebbels]], as dictated in Hitler's [[Last Will and Testament]]. With Goebbels following Hitler's suicide with his own, the reins of power passed to Grand Admiral [[Karl Dönitz]] as [[President of Germany]]. Dönitz in turn appointed non-partisan conservative [[Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk|Count Schwerin von Krosigk]] as head of government with the title Leading Minister. Dönitz and Schwerin von Krosigk negotiated the surrender to the Allies.

==Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany (since 1949)==
{{Main|Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)}}

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right; float:right; margin-left:5px&quot;&gt;{{Timeline federal chancellors of Germany}}&lt;/div&gt;
The 1949 German [[constitution]], the [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] (''Grundgesetz''), invests the Chancellor (German, ''Bundeskanzler'') with broad powers to initiate government policy. For that reason, some observers refer to the German political system as a &quot;chancellor democracy&quot;. Whichever major party (CDU/CSU or SPD) does not hold the chancellorship usually calls its leading candidate for the federal election &quot;[[chancellor-candidate]]&quot; (''Kanzlerkandidat''). The Federal Government (''Bundesregierung'') consists of the Chancellor and his or her [[Cabinet of Germany|cabinet ministers]].

[[File:07.08.21.Bundeskanzleramt.jpg|thumb|left|The Chancellor's Office in Berlin]]

The chancellor's authority emanates from the provisions of the Basic Law and in practice from his or her status as leader of the [[political party|party]] (or coalition of parties) holding a majority of seats in the ''[[Bundestag]]'' (federal parliament). With the exception of [[Helmut Schmidt]], the chancellor has usually also been chairman of his or her own party. This was the case with Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] from 1999 until he resigned the chairmanship of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] in 2004.

The German Chancellor is officially addressed as &quot;Herr Bundeskanzler&quot; if the Chancellor is a man. The current female Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] is officially addressed as &quot;Frau Bundeskanzlerin&quot;, the female form of the title. Use of the mixed form &quot;Frau Bundeskanzler&quot; was deprecated by the government in 2004 because it is regarded as impolite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.n-tv.de/589342.html &quot;Frau Bundeskanzler&quot; oder ... &quot;Frau Bundeskanzlerin&quot;? – n-tv.de&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Christian Democratic Union of Germany''' ({{lang-de|Christlich Demokratische Union Deutschlands}}, CDU; {{IPA-de|ˈkʁɪstlɪç ˌdemoˈkʁaːtɪʃə uˈni̯oːn ˈdɔʏtʃlants}}) is a [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] and [[conservatism|conservative]] political party in [[Germany]].  It is regarded as on the [[centre-right]] of the German political spectrum. Along with its [[Bavaria]]n sister party, the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]], the CDU forms the [[CDU/CSU]] grouping, also known as the Union, in the [[Bundestag]].

The leader of the party, [[Angela Merkel]], is the current [[Chancellor of Germany]].  The CDU is a member of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP), and sits in the [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|EPP Group]] in the [[European Parliament]].  Internationally, the CDU is a member of the [[Centrist Democrat International]] and the [[International Democrat Union]].  The CDU is the largest political party in Germany, followed by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]].

==Party platform==
The CDU is Christian-based, applying the principles of [[Christian democracy]] and emphasising the &quot;Christian understanding of humans and their responsibility toward God.&quot; CDU membership consists however of people adhering to a variety of religions as well as non-religious individuals. The CDU's policies derive from [[Political Catholicism]], [[Catholic social teaching]] and political [[Protestantism]], as well as [[fiscal conservatism]] and [[national conservatism]]. The CDU was the first proponent of the [[social market economy]], although the party has adopted more [[economic liberalism|liberal economics]] policies since [[Helmut Kohl]]'s term in office as the Chancellor of Germany (1982–1998). In terms of foreign policy, the CDU commits itself to [[European integration]] and a strong relation with the [[United States|USA]]. In the [[European Union]], and opposes the entry of [[Turkey]] into the EU, preferring instead a privileged partnership with [[Turkey]]. In addition to citing various human rights violations, the CDU also believes that Turkey's unwillingness to recognise [[Cyprus]] as an independent, sovereign state contradicts the EU policy that its members must recognise the existence of one another. Domestically, the CDU emphasises curtailing [[red tape]] and the preservation of cultural traditions.

Opponents of the CDU are the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), the [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] party and [[Alliance '90/The Greens]]. The CDU has however governed in two [[grand coalition (Germany)|Grand Coalition]]s with the SPD as well as in various coalitions with the Alliance '90/The Greens. The CDU rejects coalitions with The Left and extremist right-wing parties.

The [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP), a [[conservative liberalism|conservative-liberal]] party, is the preferred partner of any CDU government since the CDU and FDP have similar attitudes towards [[fiscal policy]]. As a [[conservatism|conservative]] party, the CDU supports stronger punishments of crimes and supports involvement on the part of the [[Bundeswehr]] in cases of domestic [[Counter-terrorism|anti-terrorism]] offensives as well as in natural catastrophes. In terms of immigrants, the CDU supports initiatives to integrate immigrants through language courses, and aims to further control immigration. [[Multiple citizenship|Dual citizenship]] should only be allowed in exceptional cases.

==History==
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F019970-0020, Düsseldorf, CDU-Bundesparteitag, Adenauer, Erhard.jpg|thumb|Party convention, Düsseldorf 1965]]

Immediately following the collapse of the [[Nazi]] [[dictatorship]] at the end of [[World War II]], the need for a new political order in [[Germany]] was imminent. Simultaneous yet unrelated meetings began occurring throughout Germany, each with the intention of planning a “Christian-democratic party.” The “Christlich-Demokratische Union” was established in [[Berlin]] on 26 June 1945, and in [[Rheinland]] and [[Westfalen]] in September of the same year.
[[File:CDU Wahlkampfplakat - kaspl017.JPG|left|thumb|Poster for the CDU, 1957. &quot;No
experiments&quot;.]]
The founding members of the CDU consisted primarily of former members of the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], [[German Democratic Party]], [[German National People’s Party]], and [[German People’s Party]]. Many of these individuals, including CDU-Berlin founder [[Andreas Hermes]] and future chancellor of Germany [[Konrad Adenauer]], were imprisoned for the involvement in the [[German Resistance]] during the Nazi dictatorship. 

One of the lessons learned from the failure of the [[Weimar Republic]] was that disunity among the democratic parties ultimately allowed for the rise of the [[Nazi Party]]. It was therefore crucial to create a unified party of Christian Democrats – a Christian Democratic ‘’Union’’. The result of these meetings was the establishment of an interconfessional ([[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] alike) party influenced heavily by the political tradition of [[liberal conservatism]]. The CDU experienced considerable success gaining support from the time of its creation in Berlin on 26 June 1945 until its first [[political convention|convention]] on 21 October 1950, at which Chancellor Adenauer was named the first [[Chairman]] of the party.

The CDU was the dominant party for the first two decades following the establishment of [[West Germany]] in 1949. Konrad Adenauer remained the party’s leader until 1963, at which point former minister of economics [[Ludwig Erhard]] replaced him. As the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP) withdrew from the governing coalition in 1966 due to disagreements over fiscal and economic policy, Erhard was forced to resign. Consequently, a [[grand coalition]] with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) took over government under CDU Chancellor [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]].

The SPD quickly gained popularity and succeeded in forming a [[social-liberal coalition]] with the FDP following the [[German federal election, 1969|1969 federal election]], forcing the CDU out of power for the first time in their history. The CDU continued its role as [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] until 1982, when the FDP’s withdrawal from the coalition with the SPD allowed the CDU to regain power. CDU Chairman [[Helmut Kohl]] became the new Chancellor of West Germany and his CDU-FDP coalition was confirmed in the [[German federal election, 1983|1983 federal election]]. Public support for the coalition’s work in the process of [[German reunification]] was reiterated in the [[German federal election, 1990|1990 federal election]], in which the CDU-FDP governing coalition experienced a clear victory.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-0518-028, Staatsvertrag BRD-DDR, Helmut Kohl, Lothar de Maizière.jpg|thumb|East German CDU leader [[Lothar de Maizière]] (left) with West German CDU leader Helmut Kohl, September 1990]]

After the [[Die Wende|collapse]] of the [[East Germany|East German]] government in 1989, Kohl – supported by the governments of [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]] – called for [[German reunification]]. On 3 October 1990, the German Democratic Republic (GDR) was abolished and its territory re-annexed by West Germany. The [[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|East German CDU]] merged with its West German counterpart, and elections were held for the reunified country. Although Kohl was re-elected, the party began losing much of its popularity because of an economic recession in the former GDR and increased taxes in the west. The CDU was, however, able to win the [[German federal election, 1994|1994 federal election]] by a narrow margin due to an economic recovery.

Helmut Kohl served as chairman until the party's electoral defeat in 1998, when he was succeeded by [[Wolfgang Schäuble]]; Schäuble resigned in early 2000 as a result of a party [[1999 CDU contributions scandal|financing scandal]] and was replaced by [[Angela Merkel]], who remains the leader of the CDU to this day. In the [[German federal election, 1998|1998 federal election]], the CDU polled 28.4% and the CSU 6.7% of the national vote, which was the lowest result for CDU/CSU since 1949. Thus, a [[Red-green alliance|Red-Green coalition]] under the leadership of Gerhard Schröder took power until 2005. In 2002, the CDU and CSU polled slightly higher – 29.5% and 9.0%, respectively – but still lacked the majority needed for a CDU-FDP coalition government.

In 2005 early elections were called after the CDU dealt the governing SPD a major blow, winning more than ten state elections, most of which were [[List of landslide victories|landslide victories]]. The resulting [[grand coalition]] between the CDU/CSU and the SDP faced a serious challenge stemming from both parties’ demand for the chancellorship. After three weeks of negotiations, however, the two parties reached a deal whereby CDU received the chancellorship while the SPD retained 8 of the 16 seats in the cabinet and a majority of the most prestigious cabinet posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4325600.stm | work=BBC News | title=Merkel named as German chancellor | date=October 10, 2005 | accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/10/13/germany.government.ap/ | work=CNN}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition deal was approved by both parties at party conferences on November 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4434812.stm | work=BBC News | title=German parties back new coalition | date=November 14, 2005 | accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merkel was confirmed as the first female Chancellor of Germany by the majority of delegates (397 to 217) in the newly assembled Bundestag on 22 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4458430.stm | work=BBC News | title=Merkel becomes German chancellor | date=November 22, 2005 | accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the CDU/CSU lost support in the [[German federal election, 2009|2009 federal elections]], the FDP experienced the best election cycle in their history, thereby enabling a CDU/CSU-FDP coalition. This marked the first change of coalition partner by a Chancellor in German history.

==Internal structure==
===Members===
A May 2011 study by the [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]] concluded that the CDU currently has 499,646 members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Die Mitglieder der CDU&quot;&gt;Die Mitglieder der CDU: [http://www.kas.de/wf/de/33.12166/ Studie by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; Of those nearly half-million members, 25.4 % of members are female and 74.6 % male. Female participation is higher in the former [[East Germany|East German]] states with 29.2 % compared to 24.8% in the former [[West Germany|West German]] states.

Before 1966, membership totals in CDU organisation were only estimated. The numbers after 1966 are based on the total from 31 December of the previous year.

===Party strongholds===
The traditional strongholds of the party are concentrated in rural and [[Catholic]] regions such as the [[Eifel]], [[Münsterland]], [[Sauerland]], [[Fulda (district)|Fulda]] district, [[Emsland]], [[Oldenburger Münsterland]], the [[Thuringia]] [[Eichsfeld]] as well as areas in [[Nordfriesland]],  [[Saxony]], [[Swabia|Schwaben]], [[Vorpommern]], [[Taunus]], and smaller cities such as [[Baden-Baden]], [[Konstanz]], and [[Pforzheim]]. There is less support in [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]], [[Brandenburg]], and East [[Berlin]].

===Relationship with the CSU===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Angela Merkel]] --&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F074010-0033, Köln, Deutschlandtag Junge Union.jpg|thumb|''Germany Day'' of Junge Union in Cologne, 1986]]
Both the CDU and the [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria]] (CSU) originated after World War II, sharing a concern for the Christian worldview. In the Federal Parliament (Bundestag), the CDU is represented in a common faction with the CSU. This faction is called [[CDU/CSU]] or, informally, &quot;the Union;&quot; its basis is a binding agreement known as a ''Fraktionsvertrag'' between the two parties.

The CDU and CSU share a common youth organisation: [[Junge Union]].

On issues of federal policies the CDU and CSU don't differ{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, but they remain legally and organisationally separate parties. The social differences between the CDU and the somewhat more [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] CSU have sometimes been a source of conflict in the past. The most notable and serious such incident was in 1976, when the CSU under [[Franz Josef Strauß]] ended the alliance with the CDU at a party conference in Wildbad Kreuth. This decision was reversed shortly thereafter when the CDU threatened to run candidates against the CSU in Bavaria.

The relationship of CDU to the CSU has historic parallels to previous [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] parties in Germany, with the Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] having served as a national Catholic party throughout the ''[[German Empire|Kaiserreich]]'' and the [[Weimar Republic]] with the [[Bavarian People's Party]] functioning as the Bavarian variant.

===Konrad Adenauer Foundation===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F053560-0013, Rhöndorf, Sitzung Stiftung Adenauer-Haus.jpg|thumb|Conference in [[Rhöndorf]], with eminent historian [[Golo Mann]] (center), 1978]]
The [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]] is the think-tank of the CDU. It is named after the first Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany and first president of the CDU. The foundation offers political education, conducts scientific fact-finding research for political projects, grants scholarships to gifted individuals, researches the history of [[Christian democracy]], and supports and encourages [[European integration|European unification]], international understanding, and development-policy cooperation. Its annual budget amounts to around 120 million Euro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kas.de/upload/dokumente/jahresbericht2010/Namen.pdf 2010 Annual Report] p.93 (''German'')&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special organizations===
Notable suborganisations of the CDU are:
* [[Junge Union]] (JU), the common youth organisation of the CDU and the CSU
* [[Christian Democratic Employees' Association]] (CDA), a traditionally leftist association representing Christian Democratic wage-earners
* [[Evangelical Working Group of the CDU/CSU]] (EAK, together with the CSU), representing the Protestant minority in the party
* [[Association of Christian Democratic Students]] (RCDS), the student organisation of the party

'''Christian Wilhelm Walter Wulff''' ({{IPA-de|ˈkʁɪstjan ˈvɪlhɛlm ˈvaltɐ vʊlf}}; born {{Nowrap|19 June}} 1959) is a German politician and lawyer. He served as the [[President of Germany|President]] of [[Germany]] from 2010 to 2012. A member of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]], he served as [[Prime Minister of Lower Saxony|Prime Minister]] of the [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Lower Saxony]] from 2003 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webcitation.org/5qtE0i9xO Curriculum vitae of Prime Minister Christian Wulff – Office of the Prime Minister]&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected President in the 30 June 2010 [[German presidential election, 2010|presidential election]], defeating opposition candidate [[Joachim Gauck]] and taking office immediately,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Christian Wulff zum Bundespräsidenten gewählt|publisher=Official Website of German Bundestag|date=30 June 2010|url=http://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2010/30377887_kw25_bundesversammlung_nachher/index.jsp|accessdate=30 June 2010|quote=Mit der Annahme der Wahl hat Wulff zugleich sein neues Amt angetreten.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he was not sworn in until {{Nowrap|2 July.}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloomberg&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Buergin|first1=Rainer|last2=Parkin|first2=Brian|title=Merkel's Presidential Candidate Wulff Wins in Third-Round Vote|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=30 June 2010|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-30/merkel-s-presidential-candidate-wulff-wins-in-third-round-vote.html|accessdate=30 June 2010|quote=Wulff, who is married with one daughter and a son, will be sworn in on 2 July.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 February 2012, Wulff resigned as President of Germany, facing the prospect of prosecution for allegations of corruption relating to his prior service as Prime Minister of Lower Saxony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/9088324/Blow-to-Merkel-as-German-president-resigns.html |title=Blow to Merkel as German president resigns |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=17 February 2012 |last=Waterfield |first=Bruno}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education ==
Wulff was born in [[Osnabrück]] and is [[Roman Catholicism in Germany|Roman Catholic]]. He was the first Roman Catholic to hold the post of President of Germany since [[Heinrich Lübke]] (1959–1969).&lt;ref name=&quot;common-talk.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.common-talk.com/cms/node/9937 |title=Germany’s new president Christian Wulff embracing his second wife &amp;#124; Language Creates Value |publisher=Common-talk.com |date=16 July 2010 |accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father left the family, and he grew up with his mother. As a teenager, he took responsibility for the care of his younger sister, after his mother developed [[multiple sclerosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kleinezeitung.at/nachrichten/politik/aussenpolitik/2366743/christian-wulff-sieht-sich-nicht-alpha-tier.story|title=Christian Wulff im Porträt|work=[[Kleine Zeitung]]|date=30 June 2010|accessdate=8 July 2010|language=G4erman}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[Abitur]] at the [[Ernst Moritz Arndt]] [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] in Osnabrück, Wulff studied law with a specialisation in economics at the [[University of Osnabrück]]. He joined the Christian Democratic Union of Germany in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/german/germ_1949a/wulff.php |title=Biography of Wulff, Christian |publisher=Archontology.org |accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 and 1990, he passed the first and second state examinations in law, and has since worked as an attorney.

==Political career==
Since 1975, Wulff has been a member of the CDU. From 1978 to 1980, he served as federal chairman of the ''Schülerunion'', a political high school student organization affiliated with the Christian Democrats. From 1979 to 1983, he was on the executive board of the [[Junge Union]] and became its regional chairman in [[Lower Saxony]] in 1983. However, he decided to resign from the board in order to pursue his law degree, which he completed in 1986. The same year, he was elected a city councillor in his hometown. Since 1984, he has sat on the CDU's regional party council of Lower Saxony, serving as its chairman since 1994.

The Christian Democrats made Wulff candidate for Premier in the run-up of the 1994 Legislative Assembly elections. However, the popular incumbent [[Gerhard Schröder]] won and secured an absolute majority in the Lower Saxony legislature, leading some observers to doubt the wisdom of the provincial party nominating a young and neophyte candidate for Premier. After four years in opposition, the 1998 legislative assembly election brought another opportunity for Wulff to become Premier. Indeed, the federal Christian Democrat party, led by Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]], pinned their hopes on Wulff – a Wulff victory would have stopped the inevitable rise of Schröder to the Social Democrat nomination for Chancellor. However, supported by a wave of sympathy for his candidacy for chancellor in the 1998 federal election, Schröder was returned to power by an enhanced majority – leaving Wulff to serve five more years as provincial leader of the opposition.

Schröder won the 1998 federal election, leaving the post of Premier to his anointed successor, Interior minister [[Gerhard Glogowski]]. The latter soon stumbled over a scandal involving free travel paid by [[TUI AG|TUI]] and was succeeded by [[Sigmar Gabriel]]. In the wake of the 1999 scandal, as well as rising discontent with Schröder's federal cabinet, the Christian Democrats rose in the opinion polls and became a serious contender for power in the 2003 assembly election.

Wulff has been one of the four deputy chairmen of the CDU party at the federal level since {{Nowrap|7 November}} 1998, and has been a board member of the [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]] since 2003.

===2003 state election===
With Lower Saxony announcing deeper cuts of education and municipal services, the stage was set for the 2003 election campaign. Wulff entered the race as the favourite to win the election and essentially campaigned on a platform of fiscal restraint and clear-cut reforms in the areas of law enforcement and education. Both issues were decisive in the assembly elections that led to a change in fortunes for the two major parties. The Christian Democrats, in the political wilderness since the 1990 Schröder victory, were returned to power in the Legislative Assembly, gaining 48.3% of the vote. Wulff was sworn in as Premier on {{Nowrap|4 March}} 2003, as the head of a coalition between centre-right Christian Democrats and liberal Free Democrats ([[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]).

===Policies===
[[File:CFK_y_Christian_Wulff.jpg|thumb|200px|With President of Argentina [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner|Cristina Fernández]].]]
As Premier, Wulff pursued a multitude of reforms, including a restructuring of the primary education system in Lower Saxony, as well as an increase of police officers on the beat. When Wulff took office, Lower Saxony faced a severe budget crisis, resulting from years of public deficits. Painful cuts to public expenditure were enacted and implemented against considerable political resistance. The measures included cuts in university funding and in benefits for the blind. Other policies concern the reform of the administration (especially the abolition of certain district authorities). Budgetary problems have continued to overshadow Wulff's policies, albeit with somewhat less pressure. Many measures have remained controversial.

Prior to the [[German federal election, 2005|2005 Federal Election]], Wulff had been mentioned as a potential candidate for the German chancellorship. Surprisingly, in a spring 2005 poll, 28 percent of all respondents named Wulff as their preferred candidate for the Christian Democrat nomination for Chancellor in the 2006 election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.n24.de/politik/inland/index.php/a2004120109373045486 n24.de] {{de icon}} {{dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Wulff only began his first term as Premier in early 2003, he is likely to dismiss such speculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftd.de/pw/de/1102146523308.html?nv=cpm|title=In der Ruhe liegt die Kraft|first=Peter|last=Ehrlich|work=[[Financial Times Deutschland]]|date=8 December 2004|accessdate=8 July 2010|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speculation had particularly increased since the December 2004 Christian Democrat federal convention in Düsseldorf, when Wulff was re-elected deputy leader of the federal party with roughly 86 per cent of all delegates supporting him. However, the premature dissolution of the Bundestag in 2005 and the subsequent election of [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] has largely put an end to further speculation about Wulff's future.

A Wulff candidacy for the CDU nomination for Chancellor was seen to appeal to northerners and liberals within the Christian Democrats. Outside the mold of a typical conservative, he may have been able to attract swing voters disillusioned with the slowness of reforms, as well as the rather high rates of unemployment in Germany. Indeed, the Premier worked on increasing his visibility beyond Lower Saxony's confines, particularly by appearing frequently on TV shows and giving interviews to the national newspapers. Moreover, Wulff is also acquiring a profile on a broad range of issues, including the reform of the German language, Medicare and social security reform, as well as a modernisation of Germany's federal constitution, the ''Grundgesetz''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/s/Rub6EAA9BF249C249FE86A5EFF3F83DC130/Doc~E339323623A95412081F4B5DEC6308A30~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html|title=Wie macht das bloß der Wulff?|work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|date=21 October 2004|accessdate=8 July 2010|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the Premier recently criticised the consensus reached between the Christian Democrat and Social Democrat parties on the modernisation of Germany's constitution, stating that he felt that the provinces had not been given sufficient powers to deal with their own affairs. Wulff has also taken a conservative stand on nuclear energy, advocating an extension of the deadlines for the decommissioning of Germany's nuclear reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesschau.de/aktuell/meldungen/0,1185,OID5113864_REF2,00.html|title=Auch Wulff fordert längere Laufzeiten|work=[[Tagesschau (Germany)|Tagesschau]]|date=6 January 2006|accessdate=8 July 2010|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech, Wulff also expressed his opposition to euthanasia and warned of a retreat of moral values. This can be seen as the first attempt to formulate a value-based agenda for the 2008 legislative assembly, and more importantly, the 2009 federal elections. In this context, it is important to note that Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] had been severely criticized for a lack of emotional warmth during the 2005 federal election campaign, leading to a worse-than-expected result for the Christian Democrats.

Wulff announced on 8 January that Lower Saxony would become the first province to approve a new model according to which the government will temporarily pay part of the salaries for low-salary jobs, if the employers concerned are willing to employ an employee concerned on a long-term basis. This pilot is supposed to make new jobs more affordable in Germany's notoriously high-wages environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welt.de/print-welt/article189672/Niedersachsen_fuehrt_Kombilohn_ein.html|title=Niedersachsen führt Kombilohn ein|first=Stefan|last=von Borstel|work=[[Die Welt]]|date=9 January 2006|accessdate=8 July 2010|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wulff and the 2005 federal elections===
Due to his popularity in Lower Saxony, and in federal opinion polls, Wulff was considered to be a contender for the office of Chancellor.

After the 23 May announcement that federal elections were to be advanced to [[German federal election, 2005|September 2005]], Wulff announced that he was not a candidate for the Christian Democrat nomination for Chancellor, particularly as he had not completed his first term as Premier of Lower Saxony. Instead, Wulff declared his support for [[Angela Merkel]], the CDU leader in the Bundestag. Although there was speculation that Wulff would be given a position in the new government, entering federal politics, he remained Premier of Lower Saxony.

===President of Germany===
Christian Wulff was elected [[President of Germany]] on {{Nowrap|30 June}} 2010, winning 625 of 1242 votes on the third ballot of the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundespraesident.de/en www.bundespraesident.de] [[Bundespräsidialamt]], Presse- und Öffentlichkeitsarbeit. Retrieved 1 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He became Germany's youngest president at the age of 51.&lt;ref name=&quot;common-talk.com&quot;/&gt; Wulff was sworn in on {{Nowrap|2 July}} 2010 in front of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat.

His main contender in the election was [[Joachim Gauck]], a [[civil rights]] activist from [[East Germany]] and a former [[Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Archives]]. Himself not a member of any party, Gauck was nominated by the opposition [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] and [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Greens]] as their presidential candidate on {{Nowrap|3 June}}.

Wulff was succeeded as Premier of Lower Saxony by [[David McAllister (politician)|David McAllister]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.manager-magazin.de/politik/artikel/0,2828,703986,00.html {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Wulff's candidacy for President of Germany in the [[German presidential election, 2010|2010 presidential election]] was formally confirmed by [[Angela Merkel]], [[Guido Westerwelle]] and [[Horst Seehofer]], the heads of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]], [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]] parties, during the evening of {{Nowrap|3 June}} 2010.

In August 2011 President Wulff opened an economists' conference on with a speech on the euro. He criticized the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB), which had entered a second round of bond buy-ups from heavily indebted euro-zone nations, calling the plan to stabilize the [[euro]] &quot;legally and politically questionable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,782375,00.html The German President Is 'Behaving Like a Populist']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scandals and resignation===
In December 2011, allegations emerged over President Christian Wulff’s former ties with affluent businessmen. While he was still Premier of Lower Saxony, the state parliament inquired whether Wulff had any business ties with friend and millionaire entrepreneur Egon Geerkens. He denied that he had, concealing that he had received a private loan of some €500,000 from Geerkens' wife Edith in 2008 to purchase a house. Geerkens even admitted to managing the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,804631,00.html|title='President Wulff Lied'|publisher=[[Spiegel Online]] International|date=12 December 2011|accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 22 December, Wulff made a public statement apologizing for his handling of the loan affair and conceded that he should have made his personal records available more quickly. &quot;That was not straightforward and I am sorry,&quot; he added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,805409,00.html|title=German President Apologizes for Handling of Loan Affair|publisher=Spiegel Online International|date=22 December 2011|accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just when the affair seemed to settle down, it was revealed that President Wulff had applied undue pressure on [[Springer Press]] to delay or even prevent initial revelations on the loan scandal until he was back from a visit abroad. When Wulff found out that the ''[[BILD]]'' tabloid was going to break the story, he called editor-in-chief [[Kai Diekmann]], but only reached his voice mail and left a message in which he angrily threatened a &quot;final break&quot; in relations with the Springer publishing house and to take legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,806665,00.html|title=President Accused of Threatening Tabloid Newspaper|publisher=Spiegel Online International|date=1 January 2012|accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the beginning of January 2012, President Wulff lost support by the public, commentators called for him to resign, the opposition increased pressure again, and his own party was distancing itself from him for his attempted censure of freedom of the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,806899,00.html|title='Wulff Has Destroyed His Last Remnants of Credibility'|publisher=Spiegel Online International|date=3 January 2012|accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of 4 January 2012, Wulff gave a much anticipated interview in a program broadcast jointly by the two main public TV stations [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] and [[ZDF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ardmediathek.de/ard/servlet/content/3517136?documentId=9181010|title=Das Interview mit Bundespräsident Christian Wulff (original German)|publisher=[[ARD (broadcaster)]]|date=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He declared that he wanted to stay in office and that the call to Diekmann had been a &quot;serious mistake&quot; that was &quot;unworthy&quot; of a president and for which he had already apologised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundespraesident.de/SharedDocs/Berichte/DE/Reisen-und-Termine/2012/01/120104-Interview.html|title=Fernseh-Interview von Bundespräsident Christian Wulff|publisher=Office of the Federal President|date=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thelocal.de/politics/20120104-39917.html|title=President Wulff clings on|publisher=The Local|date=4 January 2012|accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the sake of transparency, he further promised to have his office publish the responses to some 400 recent press inquiries online and initially posted a summary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redeker.de/main-V2.php/de/news/pm20120105.html|title=Zusam­menfassende Stellungnahme zu den Medienanfragen an Christian Wulff (in German)|publisher=Redeker Sellner Dahs law office for the Office of the Federal President|date=5 January 2012|accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but then revoked his promise a few days later, citing confidentiality issues and organizational difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://faz.net/aktuell/politik/affaere-des-bundespraesidenten-wulffs-antworten-werden-doch-nicht-veroeffentlicht-11599816.html|title=Antworten auf 400 Fragen an Wulff bleiben geheim (in German)|publisher=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|date=10 January 2012|accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a week however, several newspapers began making use of their right to publish their own enquiries with the respective responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,808822,00.html|title=German President Blasted by Party Allies|publisher=Spiegel Online International|date=12 January 2012|accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article13812449/Die-Welt-veroeffentlicht-alle-Fragen-zur-Causa-Wulff.html|title=Die &quot;Welt&quot; veröffentlicht alle Fragen zur Causa Wulff (in German)|work=[[Die Welt]]|accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 January, Wulff’s lawyer announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redeker.de/main-V2.php/de/news/pm20120118.html|title=Veröffentlichung der Journalistenanfragen an Christian Wulff und der gegebenen Antworten (in German)|publisher=Redeker Sellner Dahs law office for the Office of the Federal President|date=18 January 2012|accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and presented online transcripts of legally released journalists’ questions and their respective answers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdf.redeker.de/|title= Erläuternde Hinweise zur Veröffentlichung der Journalistenanfragen an Christian Wulff und der gegebenen Antworten (in German)|publisher=Redeker Sellner Dahs law office for the Office of the Federal President|date=18 January 2012|accessdate=1 February 2012}} transcript files are listed at bottom of page&lt;/ref&gt;

As more allegations of possible corruption emerged, the prosecutors in [[Hanover]], the capital city of the state of Lower Saxony, sought the Bundestag to lift Wulff’s immunity as President to investigate possible granting and/or accepting of undue advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17072479|title=German President Wulff quits in home loan scandal|publisher=BBC|date=17 February 2012|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-empting this, Wulff resigned on 17 February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,815910,00.html|title= German President Resigns – Wulff Announces He Will Step Down|publisher=Spiegel Online International|date=17 January 2012|accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a reason for his resignation, Wulff stated that &quot;(the German people's) trust and thus his effectiveness have been seriously damaged&quot; and that &quot;for this reason it is no longer possible for him to exercise the office of president at home and abroad as required.&quot; The media reaction stressed that Wulff's resignation was inevitable&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/02/2012217101341425171.html |title=German president quits over scandal – Europe |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=4 October 2011 |accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it presented another challenge for Merkel, who will have to find another candidate amidst the Eurozone crisis.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

'''Claudia Nolte''' was born Claudia Wiesemüller on February 7, 1966 in [[Rostock]], a town that then lay in [[East Germany]]. Nolte became a [[Germany|German]] [[politician]] of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] party (CDU), becoming the youngest cabinet minister in German history whilst in office from 1994&amp;ndash;98. She was [[Bundestag|Federal Minister]] for family, seniors, women and youth affairs and has been President of the European Union Council of Ministers. Claudia is a Catholic and is active in the Catholic community. She is married to investigative journalist David Crawford of [[The Wall Street Journal]]. With her marriage in July 2008, she changed her name to Claudia Crawford.

==Childhood ==
Claudia Wiesemüller was born in 1966 and in her teenage years was refused admission to a college preparatory school due to her participation in Catholic church youth activities. East German school officials required her to learn a trade before she could enroll in college, so whilst attending a technical [[secondary school]] in Rostock, she took vocational training in marine electronics from 1982 to 1984.

==Entry into politics==
In 1985, Nolte studied automation and [[cybernetic]] engineering at the [[Technische Universität Ilmenau|Technical University of Ilmenau]], where she graduatated with a [[Diplom]] degree in 1990. In October 1989 she was active in the opposition movement [[Neues Forum|New Forum]] within the [[German Democratic Republic]] and joined the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in February 1990. After completing her studies at the Technical University of Ilmenau, she accepted a position as a research assistant there but left this job within weeks owing to her election to the first freely elected East German parliament. 

==Political office==
From March to October 1990, Nolte was a member of the parliament of the German Democratic Republic, or East Germany. After German unification on October 3, 1990 she joined the [[Bundestag]] where she served from 1991 to 1994 as her party's spokeswoman on women's policy. From 1992 to 1994 she was a member of Thuringia CDU.

On November 18, 1994, Nolte became the minister for family, senior citizens and youth. She was 28 years old, making her the youngest German cabinet minister in German history. On November 30, 1994 she was named the European Union Council of Ministers President &amp;ndash; again the youngest ever. In 1998 she left the German cabinet when her party joined the opposition. From 1996 to 2000 Nolte was a member of the CDU presiding council in Germany and from January 1999 to October 2002 she was commissioner of the CDU/CSU-fraction for disabled people.

From 2002 to 2005, Nolte was vice chairman for [[United Nations]] contacts in the German parliament. In 2005 she failed to win a direct seat in the Bundestag representing the Gotha Ilm county electoral district. Under Germany's electoral law she was eligible to return to the German Federal Parliament via the state list in May 2008, but she declined.

==Later career==
In January 2006, Nolte moved to [[Belgrade]] where she directed the activities of a political foundation, heading the [[Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung]] offices in Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo. In April 2010 she moved to [[London]] where she heads (as of 2010) the activities of the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung offices in the United Kingdom and Ireland.

She is a member of the German American Society, Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung, [[Christlich-Demokratische Arbeitnehmerschaft]] (CDA) and of CDU/CSU's association of medium-sized businesses ''Mittelstands- und Wirtschaftsvereinigung'' (MIT).

'''Democratic Awakening''' (''{{lang-de|Demokratischer Aufbruch}}'') was an [[East Germany|East German]] opposition political movement. It was founded in October 1989, based on existing politically active church groups. Founding members included Wolfgang Schnur, [[Friedrich Schorlemmer]], [[Rainer Eppelmann]], [[Günter Nooke]] and [[Thomas Welz]]. The organisation was officially transformed into a political party on December 16/17, 1989 in [[Leipzig]]. The party convention adopted a more conservative program than some of the founding members, like Schorlemmer, were willing to bear, so they left the party. Others, like Nooke, who left some time later, resented the growing cooperation with [[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of East Germany]], which had formerly been a party in the socialist dominated democratic block of parties and mass organisations and had supported the totalitarian regime. 

Democratic Awakening now supported rapid [[German reunification]] and formed part of the [[Alliance for Germany]] (''Allianz für Deutschland'') with CDU and [[German Social Union (East Germany)|DSU]] for the [[East German general election, 1990|1990 Volkskammer elections]] on March 18. Only a few days prior to the elections, party chairman Schnur had to confess having been an informer for the [[Ministry for State Security (East Germany)|Ministry for State Security]] and resigned. Although Alliance for Germany won the elections, Alliance member Democratic Awakening only collected 0.9% of votes, amounting to four seats in Volkskammer. Eppelmann became minister for disarmament and defense in the new government and new party chairman. On August 5, 1990 Democratic Awakening ceased to exist after merging into the East German CDU, which in turn on 3 October 1990 merged into its [[West German]] counterpart, the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU). 

From February 1990 [[Angela Merkel]] served as the party's spokeswoman.  After the mergers, Ms. Merkel was elected in the [[German federal election, 1990|post-unification election]] as a member of parliament for the CDU, and eventually became [[Chancellor of Germany]] in 2005.

The '''Evangelical Church in Germany''' ({{lang-de|Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland}}, abbreviated '''EKD''') is a [[federation]] of 22 [[Lutheran]], [[Prussian Union (Evangelical Christian Church)|Unified (Prussian Union)]] and [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] ([[Calvinist]]) [[Protestant]] [[Landeskirche|regional church bodies]] in Germany. The EKD is not a church in a theological understanding because of the [[Christian denomination|denominational]] differences. However, the member churches (''Gliedkirchen'') share full [[pulpit]] and [[altar]] [[Full communion|fellowship]]. The EKD has a membership of 24.832 million parishioners or 30.2% of the German population (status 31 December 2007).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ekd.de/statistik/mitglieder.html&lt;/ref&gt; Membership rates fell in 2008 to 24.515 million parishioners or 29.9% by the end of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekir.de/ekir/dokumente/Tab01.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Only one member church (the [[Evangelical Reformed Church]]) is not restricted to a certain territory. In a certain way, the other member churches resemble [[diocese]]s of the [[Anglican]] or [[Roman Catholic]] churches from an organisational point of view. However, the member churches of the EKD are independent with their own theological and formal organisation. Most member churches are led by a (state) [[bishop]]. One of the regional leaders is elected Council Chairman (''Ratsvorsitzender'') of the EKD by the Synod and Church Conference. All regional churches of the EKD are members of the [[Community of Protestant Churches in Europe]].

The German term {{lang|de|''evangelisch''}} here more accurately corresponds to the broad English term ''Protestant''&lt;ref&gt;Peter Terrell, ''Harper Collins German Unabridged Dictionary'', 4th ed., (New York: HarperCollins Publishers, Inc., 1999), 273 ''sub loco''.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than to the narrower ''[[evangelical]]'' (in German called {{lang|de|''evangelikal''}}), although the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]] and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of England]] use the term in the same way as the German church. Literally, {{lang|de|''evangelisch''}} means &quot;of the Gospel&quot;, denoting a [[Protestant Reformation]] emphasis on {{lang|la|''[[sola scriptura]]''}}, &quot;by scripture alone&quot;.

== History ==
Since the [[Peace of Augsburg]] 1555 until the end of [[World War I]] and the collapse of the [[German Empire]], some Protestant churches were [[state church]]es. Each {{lang|de|''[[Landeskirche]]''}}&lt;ref name=&quot;ekd.de&quot;/&gt; (regional church) was the official church of one of the [[states of Germany]] while the respective ruler was the church's formal head (e.g. the [[List of rulers of Prussia|King of Prussia]] headed the [[Evangelical Church of Prussia's older Provinces]] as supreme governor), similar to the [[British monarch]]'s role in the [[Church of England]].

This changed somewhat with growing religious freedom in the 19th century, especially in the three [[republicanism|republican]] states of [[Bremen]], [[Lübeck]] and [[Hamburg]]. The greatest change came after the [[German Revolution]] with the formation of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the abdication of the [[Prince#Prince as generic for ruler|princes]] of the German states. The system of state churches disappeared with the monarchies, and there was a desire for the Protestant churches to merge. In fact, a merger was permanently under discussion but never materialized due to strong regional self-confidence and traditions as well as the denominational fragmentation into [[Lutheran]], [[Reformed]] and United churches. During the revolution when the old church governments lost power, the People's Church Union ({{lang|de|''Volkskirchenbund''}}) was formed advocating unification without respect to theological tradition and increasing input from [[laymen]]. However, the People's Church Union quickly split along territorial lines after the churches' relationship with the government improved.&lt;ref name=statusofprotchurches&gt;D. Karl Bornhausen, &quot;The Present Status of the Protestant Churches in Germany,&quot; ''The Journal of Religion'', Vol. 3, No. 5 (Sep. 1923), 501-524.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was realized that one mainstream Protestant church for all of Germany was impossible and that any union would need a federal model. The churches met in [[Dresden]] in 1919 and created a plan for federation, and this plan was adopted in 1921 at [[Stuttgart]]. Then in 1922 the 28 territorially defined Protestant churches founded the [[German Evangelical Church Confederation]] ({{lang|de|''Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchenbund'' (DEKB)}}). At the time, the federation was the largest Protestant church union in Europe with around 40 million members.&lt;ref name=&quot;statusofprotchurches&quot;/&gt; Because it was a union of independent bodies, the Church Union's work was limited to foreign missions and relations with Protestant churches outside Germany, especially German Protestants in other countries.

In July 1933, the German Evangelical Church ({{lang|de|''Deutsche Evangelische Kirche''}}, DEK) was  formed under the influence of the [[German Christians]]. The [[National Socialist]]s had much influence over the decisions of the first National [[Synod]], via their unambiguous partisanship in successfully backing [[Ludwig Müller (theologian)|Ludwig Müller]] for the office of Reich bishop.  He did not manage, however, to prevail over the {{lang|de|''Landeskirchen''}} in the long term, and after the installation of [[Hanns Kerrl]] as minister for church matters in a Führer-directive of 16 July 1935 and the foundation of the [[Protestant Reich Church]], the DEK played more or less no further role.  

In 1948, freed from the German Christians' influence, the Lutheran, Reformed and United churches came together as the Evangelical Church in Germany at the Conference of Eisenach. In 1969, the churches in [[East Germany]] broke away from the EKD and formed the League of Evangelical Churches in the German Democratic Republic ({{lang-de|[[:de:Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR|Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR]]}}, BEK). In June 1991, following [[German reunification]], the BEK merged with the EKD.

While the members are no longer established churches, they are still called {{lang|de|''Landeskirchen''}}, and some have this term in their official names. A modern English translation, however, would be ''regional church''. Apart from some minor changes, the territories of the member churches today reflect Germany's political organisation in the year 1848, with state churches for states or provinces that no longer exist. For example between 1945 and 1948, the remaining six ecclesiastical provinces ({{lang|de|''Kirchenprovinzen''}}), each territorially comprising one of the [[Provinces of Prussia|Old Prussia]] provinces, within the [[Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union]] assumed independence as a consequence of the estrangement among them during the Nazi [[Kirchenkampf|struggle of the churches]]. This turned the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union into a mere umbrella, being itself a member of EKD but covering some regional church bodies, which were again themselves members of EKD.
[[Ordination of women]] is practised in all 22 member churches with many women having been ordained in recent years. There are also several female bishops. [[Margot Käßmann]], former Bishop of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover]] and Chairperson of the Council of the EKD from 2009 until February 2010, was the first woman to head the EKD.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsche Welle, 2009-10-28.

== Membership ==
Protestantism is the major religion in [[Northern Germany|Northern]], Eastern and [[Middle Germany]]: the [[Calvinism|Reformed]] branch in the extreme northwest and [[Lippe]], the [[Lutheran]] branch in the north and south, and the [[United and uniting churches|United]] branch in Middle and [[Western Germany]]. While the majority of Christians in [[Southern Germany]] are [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], some areas in [[Baden-Württemberg]] and [[Bavaria]] are predominantly Protestant, e.g. [[Middle Franconia]] and the [[Stuttgart (region)|government region of Stuttgart]]. The vast majority of German Protestants belong to a member church of the EKD. With 25,100,727 members in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ekd.de/english/4329-christians_in_germany.html &quot;Christians in Germany 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; around 30 percent of all Germans belong to a member church of the EKD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekd.de/statistik/mitglieder.html Statistical information &quot;Zahlen und Fakten zum kirchlichen Leben&quot; (EKD)]&lt;/ref&gt; Average church attendance is lower, however, with only around a million people attending a service on Sunday.&lt;ref name=services&gt;[http://www.ekd.de/english/4329-service_workship_holy_communion.html EKD: Services of Worship and Holy Communion 2006]. Accessed 16 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Protestant denominations that are not part of the Evangelical Church in Germany include the [[United Methodist Church]] ({{lang-de|Evangelisch-methodistische Kirche}}, EmK), the [[Independent Evangelical-Lutheran Church]], Baptists organised in the [[Union of Evangelical Free Church Congregations in Germany]] (''Bund evangelisch-freikirchlicher Gemeinden''), Pentecostals organised in the Union of Pentecostal Free-Churches (''Bund Freier Pfingstgemeinden''), the [[Union of the Free Evangelical Churches in Germany]] (''Bund Freier evangelischer Gemeinden in Deutschland''), [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and the [[New Apostolic Church]].

==Structure and practices==
The structure of the EKD is based on [[Federation|federal]] principles. Each local church is responsible for Christian life in its own area while each regional church has its own special characteristics and retains its independence. The Church carries out joint tasks with which its members have entrusted it. For the execution of these tasks, the Church has the following governing bodies, all organised and elected on democratic lines: 
=== Synode ===
The Synod is the legislature of the EKD. It has 126 members - 106 elected by ''Landeskirchen'' synods and 20 appointed by the Council. These 20 are appointed for their importance in the life of the Church and its agencies. Members serve six year terms and the synod meets annually.

The '''Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth''' ({{lang-de|Bundesministerium für Familie, Senioren, Frauen und Jugend}}) is a Ministry of [[Germany]]. It is headquartered in Berlin with a secondary seat in [[Bonn]]. The present minister is [[Kristina Schröder]] of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]].

== History ==
The original organization was first founded in 1953 as the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs (''Bundesministerium für Familienfragen''). In 1957, this was changed to the Ministry for Family and Youth Affairs (''Bundesministerium für Familien- und Jugendfragen'') and in 1963 to the Federal Ministry for Family and Youth (''Bundesministerium für Familie und Jugend''. In 1969 after the incorporation of the 1961-created Federal Ministry for Health (''Bundesministerium für Gesundheit''), it was changed to the Federal Ministry for Youth, Family and Health (''Bundesministerium für Jugend, Familie und Gesundheit''). In 1986, it was renamed to the Federal Ministry for Youth, Family, Women, and Health (''Bundesministerium für Jugend, Familie, Frauen und Gesundheit''). The area of health was removed in 1991 and transferred to the Federal Ministry for Health (now the [[Federal Ministry for Health and Social Security]], ''Bundesministerium für Gesundheit und Soziale Sicherung''). The remaining Ministry was divided into the Federal Ministry for Women and Youth (''Bundesministerium für Frauen und Jugend'') and the Federal Ministry for Family and Senior Citizens (''Bundesministerium für Familie und Senioren''). In 1994, these divided areas were combined into the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (''Bundesministerium für Familie, Senioren, Frauen und Jugend'').

The Ministry was highlighted in 2007 when the contents of one of the leaflets it distributed was claimed to encourage [[sexual massage]] between parents and their children.&lt;ref&gt;Franziska Badenschier, ''Der Spiegel'', 2007-07-31. [http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,497527,00.html &quot;Körper, Liebe, Doktorspiele&quot;: Von der Leyen stoppt umstrittene Aufklärungsbroschüre]. {{de-icon}} Retrieved 2010-11-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The booklets were removed from circulation when the matter became national news.

'''Frank-Walter Steinmeier''' {{IPA-de|ˈfʁaŋkˌvaltɐ ˈʃtaɪ̯nˌmaɪ̯.ɐ|}} (born 5 January 1956) is a [[Germany|German]] politician of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), and currently the leader of the opposition in the [[Bundestag]]. Steinmeier was a close aide of Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]], serving as Chief of Staff in the [[German Chancellery]] from 1999 to 2005. He subsequently served as [[Foreign Minister of Germany|Foreign Minister]] (2005–2009) and [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany|Vice Chancellor]] (2007–2009) in the [[grand coalition]] government of [[Angela Merkel]]. In 2008, he briefly served as acting chairman of his party.

==Early life==
Steinmeier was born in [[Detmold]]. Following his ''[[Abitur]]'', he served his military service from 1974 until 1976. He then studied law and political science at the [[University of Giessen|Justus-Liebig-Universität]] of [[Gießen]]. In 1982 he passed his first and 1986 his second state examination in law. He worked as scientific assistant to the professor of public law and political science at the Gießen university, until he obtained his doctorate of law in 1991.

Steinmeier is married and has one daughter.

On 24 August 2010, due to an illness of his wife, he successfully donated a kidney to her.

==Political career==
Steinmeier became an adviser in 1991 for law of communication media and media guidelines in the state Chancellery of [[Lower Saxony]] in [[Hanover]]. In 1993, he became director of the personal office for the then Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, [[Gerhard Schröder]]. In 1996, he became the Undersecretary of State and Director of the State Chancellery of Lower Saxony.

Steinmeier was appointed in November 1998 as Undersecretary of State in the Office of the Chancellor following Schröder's election victory. He replaced [[Bodo Hombach]] as the head of the [[German Chancellery|Office of the Chancellor]] in 1999. Because of his effective management beyond the spotlight of politics, he was nicknamed ''Die Graue Effizienz'' (The Grey Efficiency) -  a pun on ''Graue Eminenz'', the German for [[éminence grise]].

===Foreign minister===
On 22 November 2005, he became Foreign Minister of Germany in the Grand coalition cabinet formed by [[Angela Merkel]]. Steinmeier was the first SPD Foreign Minister since [[Willy Brandt]] (1966–1969).

Following [[Franz Müntefering]]'s departure from the cabinet on 21 November 2007, Steinmeier also filled the position of [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany|Vice-Chancellor]].&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Cremer and Brian Parkin, [http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&amp;sid=avKnSh84M5yQ&amp;refer=europe &quot;Muentefering, Vice-Chancellor Under Merkel, Quits&quot;], Bloomberg.com, November 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Steienmeier said he opposes European Commission proposals on unbundling the ownership of energy networks in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKL2056183720070120 German minister opposes EU utility unbundling idea] Reuters Jan 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian opposition activists celebrated when Steinmeier lost elections in 2009, signaling their discontent with Steinmeier. Oleg Orlov, head of the [[Memorial (society)|Memorial human rights group]], said that Steinmeier had prolonged Schröder's policies on Russia and that Germany's policies were &quot;extremely bad for civil society, democracy and the country as a whole&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mitrokhin&quot;&gt;[http://www.moscowtimes.ru/news/article/384405.html?bcsi_scan_3824BCB8D8969319=VysKnwvdmKseymeU5/v6mRAAAAArVj4G&amp;bcsi_scan_filename=384405.html German Vote Raises Hopes in Russia]. Moscow Times. 29 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Steinmeier refused to meet [[Dalai Lama]]. Instead, Steienmeier issued the statement &quot;it takes a lot of courage not to meet with the Dalai Lama these days&quot;, which the New York Times described as &quot;extraordinarily cynical&quot; and accused of Steinmeier of prioritizing money over human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/20/opinion/20iht-edgermany.4.13058304.html Steinmeier's bad example] New York Times May 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,553844,00.html German Minister Criticized for Planned Meeting with Dalai Lama]. Spiegel Online International. 17 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601100&amp;sid=aVLje9i2VD1A&amp;refer=germany Dalai Lama `Disappointed' Germany's Steinmeier Won't Meet Him] Bloomberg May 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Steinmeier served as acting chairman of the SPD from 7 September 2008 to 18 October 2008.

===2009 elections===
On 7 September 2008, following the resignation of SPD chairman [[Kurt Beck]], Steinmeier was chosen as the SPD candidate for chancellor for the [[German federal election, 2009|2009 federal elections]] and also designated as acting SPD Chairman, pending the return of Müntefering to that position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/08/content_9840654.htm &quot;German SPD party reshuffles leadership, with eye on election&quot;], Xinhua, September 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the SPD's decisive defeat in the elections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/6237210/Merkels-rival-concedes-defeat-in-German-election.html |title=Merkel's rival concedes defeat in German election |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=27 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steinmeier was elected as chairman of the SPD's parliamentary group in the [[Bundestag]], and as such leader of the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2009-09/spd-steinmeier-opposition |title=Steinmeier wird Oppositionsführer |newspaper=[[Die Zeit]] |date=27 September 2009 }}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a hospitalization for donating a kidney to his wife in August 2010, Steinmeier returned to his office in October 2010.

'''Franz Müntefering''' {{IPA-de|fʁants ˈmʏntəˌfeʁɪŋ||De-Franz Müntefering.ogg}} (born 16 January 1940) is a [[Germany|German]] politician and industrial manager. He was Chairman of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) from 18 October 2008 to 13 November 2009, a position he already held from 2004 to 2005. He was Federal Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, as well as [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany|Vice-Chancellor]], from 2005 to 2007.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Neheim]] (now part of [[Arnsberg]]) and joined the SPD in 1966. He was a member of the [[Bundestag]] from 1975 to 1992 and again since 1998; from 1995 to 1998 he was a member of the Landtag (state parliament) of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].

He was ''Bundesgeschäftsführer'' (executive director) of the national SPD from 1995 to 1998, and after holding briefly the post of Minister of Transportation and Construction in the first cabinet of Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]], he was the first to hold the new post of SPD General Secretary from 1999 to 2002, and thereafter became leader of the SPD fraction in the Bundestag. In February 2004 he was designated to succeed Schröder as party chairman in March 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Udo Kempf/ Hans-Georg Merz (eds.): ''Kanzler und Minister 1998-2005. Biographisches Lexikon der deutschen Bundesregierungen''. Wiesbaden: VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften, 2008, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2005, Müntefering criticized the market economy of Germany and proposed more state involvement to promote economic justice. In this speech, he described private equity firms as &quot;[[Locust (finance)|locust]]s&quot;. He subsequently published a &quot;locust list&quot; of companies, which he circulated within the SPD.&lt;ref&gt;http://service.spiegel.de/cache/international/0,1518,354733,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; This began a debate which has dominated the national news, being the subject of front-page articles and covered on the main television news broadcasts nearly every day. Müntefering's suggestions have been criticized by employers and many economists, but have met with popular support (up to 75% in some opinion polls).

On 31 October 2005, Müntefering's favoured candidate for Secretary General of the SPD, [[Kajo Wasserhövel]], was defeated by the left-wing candidate [[Andrea Nahles]] in a preliminary internal election. Müntefering subsequently announced his intention to resign as SPD Chairman, and was succeeded by [[Matthias Platzeck]] at the next party convention on 15 November 2005. Platzeck resigned from this position in April 2006, and his successor was [[Kurt Beck]].

Müntefering became Federal Minister of Labour and Social Affairs and Vice-Chancellor in the cabinet of [[Angela Merkel]] on 22 November 2005. After two years in those posts, Müntefering's spokesman said on 13 November 2007 that Müntefering would resign from them later in the month. The decision was said to be based on &quot;purely familial reasons&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2901628,00.html &quot;German Labor Minister Müntefering to Resign&quot;], ''Deutsche Welle'', November 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the day, Müntefering said that he would leave his positions in the government on 21 November attributing his decision to the illness of his wife, Ankepetra, who was suffering from cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Cremer and Brian Parkin, [http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&amp;sid=avKnSh84M5yQ&amp;refer=europe &quot;Muentefering, Vice-Chancellor Under Merkel, Quits&quot;], Bloomberg.com, 13 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon leaving office on 21 November 2007, he was replaced as Vice-Chancellor by [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] and as Minister of Labor by [[Olaf Scholz]], both of whom are also members of the SPD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/11/21/europe/EU-POL-Germany-Merkels-Two-Years.php &quot;Merkel defends record as Germany's tense governing coalition hits 2-year mark&quot;], Associated Press (''International Herald Tribune''), 21 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Müntefering's wife Ankepetra died on 31 July 2008. Following her death, Müntefering decided to return to active politics and was elected Chairman of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] on 18 October 2008.&lt;ref name=Picked&gt;Judy Dempsey, [http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/09/07/europe/germ.php &quot;German foreign minister picked to challenge Merkel&quot;], ''International Herald Tribune'', 7 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 September 2008, Kurt Beck resigned as SPD Chairman, and Müntefering succeeded Beck in that post.&lt;ref name=Picked/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/08/content_9840654.htm &quot;German SPD party reshuffles leadership, with eye on election&quot;], Xinhua, 7 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the SPD's defeat in the [[German federal election, 2009|federal election of 2009]], Müntefering resigned from the position of party chairman of the Social Democratic Party.

'''Gerhard Fritz Kurt Schröder''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡɛɐ̯haɐ̯t fʁɪts kʊʁt ˈʃʁøːdɐ||De-Gerhard Fritz Kurt Schröder.ogg}}; born 7 April 1944) is a German [[politics|politician]], and was [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Chancellor of Germany]] from 1998 to 2005. A member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]), he led a [[coalition government]] of the SPD and the [[Alliance 90/The Greens|Greens]]. Before becoming a full-time politician, he was a lawyer, and before becoming Chancellor he served as [[Premier of Lower Saxony]] (1990–1998). Following the [[German federal elections, 2005|2005 federal election]], which his party lost, after three weeks of negotiations he stood down as Chancellor in favour of [[Angela Merkel]] of the rival [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]]. He is currently the chairman of the board of [[Nord Stream AG]], after having been hired as a global manager by investment bank [[N M Rothschild &amp; Sons|Rothschild]].

== Early career ==
Schröder was born in Mossenberg, today an outlying centre of [[Blomberg (town)|Blomberg]], in what is now [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. His father, Fritz Schröder, a lance corporal in the [[Wehrmacht]], was killed in action in [[World War II]] in [[Romania]] on 4 October 1944, a few months after Gerhard's birth. His mother Erika worked as an agricultural laborer so that she could support herself and her two sons.

Schröder completed an [[apprenticeship]] in retail sales in a [[Lemgo]] hardware shop from 1958 to 1961 and subsequently worked in a [[Lage]] retail shop and after that as an unskilled construction worker and a sales clerk in [[Göttingen]] whilst studying at night school so as to gain a high school diploma. He did not have to do military service because his father had died in the war.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,128137,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Schröder secured entrance to a university, passing the [[Abitur]] exam at Westfalen-Kolleg, [[Bielefeld]]. From 1966 to 1971 he studied law at the [[University of Göttingen]]. From 1972 onwards, Schröder served as an assistant at the university. In 1976, he passed his second law examination, and he subsequently worked as a lawyer until 1990.

Among his more controversial cases, Schröder helped founding member of the [[Red Army Faction|Baader-Meinhof]] terrorist group [[Horst Mahler]] secure an early release from prison and the permission to practice law again in Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;schroeder&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jf-archiv.de/archiv98/208aa7.htm|title=Gerhard-Schröder-Biographie: Horst Mahler stellt das Buch eines Konservativen vor Hoffnung keimt im Verborgenen|accessdate=7 November 2007|work=Junge Freiheit|first=Thorsten|last=Thaler|date=8 May 1998|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schröder joined the Social Democratic Party in 1963. In 1978 he became the federal [[chairman]] of the [[Young Socialists in the SPD|Young Socialists]], the youth organisation of the SPD. He spoke for the dissident [[Rudolf Bahro]], as did President [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Wolf Biermann]]. In 1982 he wrote an article on the idea of a red/green coalition for a book at Olle &amp; Wolter, Berlin, which later appeared in &quot;[[Die Zeit]]&quot;. SPD and SI Chairman, Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]], who reviewed Olle &amp; Wolter at that time, had just asked for more books on the subject. In 1980 Gerhard Schröder was elected to the German [[Bundestag]], and wore a sweater to parliament instead of the traditional suit. He became chairman of the SPD [[Hanover]] district. In 1985, Schröder met the [[East Germany|GDR]] leader [[Erich Honecker]] during a visit to [[East Berlin]].

In 1986, Schröder was elected to the parliament of [[Lower Saxony]] and became leader of the SPD group. After the SPD won the state elections in June 1990, he became [[Premier of Lower Saxony]] as head of an SPD-[[Alliance '90/The Greens|Greens]] coalition; in this position, he also won the 1994 and 1998 state elections.

== In federal politics ==
Following his election as [[Minister-President]] in 1990, Schröder became a member of the board of the federal SPD. In 1997 and 1998 he served as [[President of the German Bundesrat|President]] of the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]], but he left office on 27 October, three days before his term expired, when he became Chancellor as head of an SPD-Green coalition. At the 22 September [[German federal election, 2002|2002 general elections]], he secured another four-year term, with a narrow nine-seat majority (down from 21).

After the resignation of [[Oskar Lafontaine]] as SPD Chairman in March, 1999, in protest at Schröder's adoption of a number of what Lafontaine considered &quot;[[neo-liberal]]&quot; policies, Schröder took over his rival's office as well. In February, 2004, he resigned as chairman of the SPD. [[Franz Müntefering]] succeeded him as chairman.

On 22 May 2005, after the SPD lost to the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democrats]] (CDU) in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Gerhard Schröder announced he would call federal elections &quot;as soon as possible&quot;. A [[motion of confidence]] was subsequently defeated in the [[Bundestag]] on 1 July 2005 by 151 to 296 (with 148 abstaining), after Schröder urged members not to vote for his government in order to trigger new elections.

[[Image:Gerhardschroeder.jpg|thumb|left|290px|&quot;SPD - Trust in Germany&quot;: Schröder in [[Esslingen am Neckar|Esslingen]].]]
The 2005 [[German federal elections, 2005|German federal elections]] were held on 18 September. After the elections, neither Schröder's SPD-Green coalition nor the alliance between CDU/CSU and the FDP led by [[Angela Merkel]] achieved a majority in parliament, but the CDU/CSU had a stronger popular electoral lead by one percentage point. Since the SPD had been trailing the CDU by more than 15 points only weeks before the election, this outcome was a surprise and was mainly attributed to Schröder's charisma and prowess as a campaigner;{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} polls consistently showed that he was much more popular with the German people than Merkel.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} On election night, both Schröder and Merkel claimed victory and chancellorship, but after initially ruling out a [[grand coalition]] with Merkel, Schröder and [[Müntefering]] entered negotiations with her and the CSU's [[Edmund Stoiber]]. On 10 October, it was announced that the parties had agreed to form a grand coalition. Schröder agreed to cede the chancellorship to Merkel, but the SPD would hold the majority of government posts and retain considerable control of government policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4325600.stm|title=Merkel named as German chancellor|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=29 April 2007|date=10 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merkel was elected chancellor on 22 November.

On 11 October, Schröder announced that he would not take a post in the new Cabinet and, in November, he confirmed that he would leave politics as soon as Merkel took office. On 23 November 2005, he resigned his [[Bundestag]] seat. Subsequently, he joined [[Ringier AG]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ringier.ch/index.cfm?pub=2 Ringier]&lt;/ref&gt; the publisher of some of the leading newspapers and magazines in Switzerland and Europe, as a [[Zurich]]-based political consultant and lobbyist.

On 14 November, at the SPD conference in [[Karlsruhe]], Schröder urged members of the SPD to support the proposed coalition, saying it &quot;carries unmistakably, perhaps primarily, the imprint of the Social Democrats&quot;. Many SPD members had previously indicated that they supported the coalition, which would have continued the policies of Schröder's government, but had objected to [[Angela Merkel]] replacing him as Chancellor. The conference voted overwhelmingly to approve the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4434812.stm|title=German parties back new coalition|work=BBC News|accessdate=29 April 2007|date=14 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chancellorship ==
===Domestic policies===
In its first term, Schröder's government decided to phase out [[nuclear power]], fund [[renewable energy|renewable energies]], institute [[civil unions in Germany|civil unions]] which enabled same-sex partners to enter into a civil union, and liberalize [[naturalization]] law. Most voters associated Schröder with the [[Agenda 2010]] reform program, which included cuts in the [[social welfare]] system ([[national health insurance]], [[unemployment insurance|unemployment payments]], [[pension]]s), lowered taxes, and reformed regulations on employment and payment.

After the 2002 election, the SPD steadily lost support in opinion polls. Many increasingly perceived Schröder's [[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]] program to be a dismantling of the German [[welfare state]]. Moreover, Germany's high unemployment rate remained a serious problem for the government. Schröder's tax policies were also unpopular; when the satirical radio show [[The Gerd Show]] released ''Der Steuersong'', featuring Schröder's voice (by impressionist [[Elmar Brandt]]) lampooning Germany's [[indirect taxation]] with the lyrics ''&quot;Dog tax, tobacco tax, emissions and environmental tax, did you really think more weren't coming?&quot;'', it became Germany's 2002 Christmas No. 1 chart hit and sold over a million copies.

The fact that Schröder served on the [[Volkswagen]] board (a position that came with his position as [[Minister-president#Germany|minister-president]] of Lower Saxony) and tended to prefer pro-car policies led to him being nicknamed the &quot;Auto-Kanzler&quot; (car chancellor).

===Foreign policy===
[[File:Vladimir Putin with Gerhard Schroeder-1.jpg|thumb|Schröder with then [[President of Russia]] [[Vladimir Putin]] in Moscow on 9 May 2005]]
[[File:Quadriga-verleihung-rr-20.jpg|thumb|upright|Gerhard Schröder attending [[Quadriga (award)|Quadriga]] awards ceremony with [[Boris Tadić]]]]
Schröder sent forces to [[Kosovo]] and to [[Afghanistan]] as part of [[NATO]] operations. Until Schröder's Chancellorship, German troops had not taken part in combat actions since [[World War II]]. With Germany having a long experience with [[terrorism]] itself, Schröder declared solidarity with the United States after the [[9/11|September 11 terrorist attacks]]. When Schröder left office Germany had 2,000 troops in Afghanistan, the largest contingent from any nation other than the United States, Britain, France, Canada and after 2 years Afghanistan.

Along with French President [[Jacques Chirac]] and many other world leaders, Schröder spoke out strongly against the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and refused any military assistance in that enterprise. Schröder's stance caused political friction between the U.S. and Germany, in particular because he used this topic for his 2002 election campaign. Schröder's stance set the stage for alleged anti-American statements by members of the SPD. The parliamentary leader of the SPD, [[Ludwig Stiegler]], compared U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] to [[Julius Caesar]] while Schröder's Minister of Justice, [[Herta Däubler-Gmelin]], likened Bush's foreign policy to that of [[Adolf Hitler]]. Schröder's critics accused him of enhancing, and campaigning on, anti-American sentiments in Germany. Since his 2002 re-election, Schröder and Bush rarely met and their animosity was seen as a widening political gap between the U.S. and Europe. Bush stated in his memoirs that Schröder initially promised to support the Iraq war but changed his mind with the upcoming German elections and public opinion strongly against the invasion, to which Schröder responded saying that Bush was “not telling the truth”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.macleans.ca/2010/11/24/schroder-bush-dust-up/]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 1 August 2004, the 60th anniversary of the 1944 [[Warsaw Uprising]], he apologised to Poland for &quot;the immeasurable suffering&quot; of its people during the conflict. He was the first German chancellor to be invited to an anniversary of the uprising.

In addition to a friendly relationship with Jacques Chirac, Schröder cultivated close ties with Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]], in an attempt to strengthen the &quot;strategic partnership&quot; between Berlin and Moscow, including the opening of a gas pipeline from ''Russian Andrew Marino-Pipelines'' over the Baltic Sea exclusively between Russia and Germany (see [[#Gazprom|&quot;Gazprom controversy&quot;]] below). Schröder was criticized in the media, and subsequently by Angela Merkel, for calling Putin a &quot;flawless democrat&quot; on 22 November 2004, only days before Putin prematurely congratulated [[Viktor Yanukovich]] during the [[Orange Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://service.spiegel.de/cache/international/0,1518,330461,00.html|title=Gerhard Schroeder's Dangerous Liaison|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=29 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Only a few days after his chancellorship, Schröder joined the board of directors of the joint venture. Thus bringing about new speculations about his prior objectivity. In his memoirs ''Decisions: My Life in Politics'', Schröder still defends his friend and political ally, and states that &quot;it would be wrong to place excessive demands on Russia when it comes to the rate of domestic political reform and democratic development, or to judge it solely on the basis of the Chechnya conflict.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,444944,00.html|title=It Would Be Wrong to Place Excessive Demands|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=29 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schröder has criticised some European countries' swift decision to recognise [[Kosovo]] as an independent state after it [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|declared independence]] in February 2008. He believes the decision was taken under heavy pressure from the U.S. government and has caused more problems, including the weakening of the so-called pro-EU forces in Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=05&amp;dd=05&amp;nav_id=49989|title=Schroeder: Kosovo recognition &quot;against Europe’s interests&quot;|work=B92|date=5 May 2008|accessdate=5 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, Schröder laid the blame for the [[2008 South Ossetia war]] squarely on [[Mikhail Saakashvili]] and &quot;the West&quot;, hinting at American foreknowledge and refusing to criticize any aspect of Russian policy which had thus far come to light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,572686-2,00.html|title=Serious Mistakes by the West|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=21 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
[[File:Gerhard and Doris Schroeder.jpg|thumb|upright|Gerhard and [[Doris Schröder-Köpf|Doris Schröder]] at the 300th anniversary of [[Saint Petersburg]] celebrations on 30 May 2003]]
Schröder has been married four times:
* Eva Schubach (married 1968, divorced 1972);
* Anne Taschenmacher (married 1972, divorced 1984);
* Hiltrud Hampel (&quot;Hillu&quot;; married 1984, divorced 1997);
* [[Doris Köpf]] (married 1997).

Schröder's four marriages have earned him the nickname &quot;Audi Man&quot;, a reference to the four-ring symbol of [[Audi]] motorcars. Another nickname is &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/germany/article/0,2763,792629,00.html|title=The Audi man|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=29 April 2007|first=Kate|last=Connolly|date=15 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/09/19/wger219.xml|title=The 'Audi Man' is not quite ready to concede defeat|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=29 April 2007|first=Charles|last=Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doris Köpf has a daughter, Klara, born in 1991, from a previous relationship with a television journalist. She lives with the couple. In July 2004, Schröder and Köpf adopted a child named [[Viktoria Schröder|Viktoria]] from [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] in Russia. In 2006, they adopted another child from St. Petersburg, Gregor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.welt.de/politik/article146254/Schroeder_nimmt_noch_ein_Kind_auf.html|title=Schröder nimmt noch ein Kind auf|work=[[Die Welt]]|date=17 August 2006|accessdate=29 April 2007|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When not in Berlin, Schröder lives in [[Hanover]].

Schröder identifies himself as a member of the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]], but does not appear to be religious. He did not add the optional phrase ''So wahr mir Gott helfe'' (&quot;so help me God&quot;) when sworn in as chancellor for his first term in 1998 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/10/27/world/main21100.shtml|title=Schroeder Takes Germany's Helm Social Democrat Sworn In As Chancellor Tuesday|work=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=8 January 2008|date=27 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accused the deeply religious former US President [[George W Bush]] of 'hearing voices.' 

Schröder's plans after leaving office as Chancellor and resigning his Bundestag seat include resuming his law practice in Berlin and writing a book. He will also be retained by the Swiss publisher Ringier AG as a consultant. He rents an apartment in Berlin while retaining his primary residence in Hanover. As a former Chancellor, he is entitled to a permanent office, also situated in Berlin. He has also spent time improving his English language skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/4509818.stm|title=Schroeder's Welsh English course|work=BBC News|accessdate=29 April 2007|date=8 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism and controversies ==
===Gazprom===
As Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder was a strong advocate of the [[Nord Stream]] pipeline project, which aims to supply Russian gas directly to Germany, thereby bypassing transit countries. The agreement to build the pipeline was signed two weeks before the [[German federal election, 2005|German parliamentary election]]. On 24 October 2005, just a few weeks before Schröder stepped down as Chancellor, the German government guaranteed to cover 1 billion euros of the Nord Stream project cost, should [[Gazprom]] default on a loan. However, this guarantee had never been used.&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite web|work=Financial Times|first1=Tobias|last1=Buck|first2=Bertrand|last2=Benoit|title=EU to probe German gas pipeline guarantee|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/4b16eef6-deb2-11da-acee-0000779e2340.html|date=8 May 2006|accessdate=26 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after stepping down as chancellor, Schröder accepted Gazprom's nomination for the post of the head of the shareholders' committee of [[Nord Stream AG]], raising questions about a potential conflict of interest. German opposition parties expressed concern over the issue, as did the governments of countries over whose territory gas is currently pumped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4515914.stm|title=Schroeder attacked over gas post|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=29 April 2007|date=10 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an editorial entitled ''Gerhard Schroeder's Sellout'', the American newspaper ''[[The Washington Post]]'' also expressed sharp criticism, reflecting widening international ramifications of Schröder's new post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/12/AR2005121201060.html|title=Gerhard Schroeder's Sellout|work=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=29 April 2007|date=13 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Democrat [[Tom Lantos]], chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs]], likened Schröder to a &quot;political prostitute&quot; for his recent behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-06-13-2870151492_x.htm|title=Lantos Raps Former European Leaders|agency=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=13 June 2007|date=13 June 2007|first=Harry|last=Dunphy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, the ''Wall Street Journal'' reported that Schröder would join the board of the oil company [[TNK-BP]], a joint venture between oil major [[BP]] and Russian partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123203091405585667.html WSJ, Schröder to join TNK-BP board, 19 January 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defamation lawsuit===
In April 2002, Schröder sued the DDP press agency for publishing an opinion of [[public relations]] consultant Sabine Schwind saying that he &quot;would be more credible if he didn't dye his gray hair&quot;. The court decided to ban the media from suggesting that he colours his hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A36035-2002May17&amp;notFound=true|title=Court: Stay Out of Schroeder's Hair|work=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=29 April 2007|first=Peter|last=Finn|date=18 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Unnecessary given the sentence afterward?: The case was taken seriously by politicians.--&gt; The Chancellor's spokesman said: &quot;This is not a frivolous action taken over whether he does or doesn't dye his hair, but is a serious issue regarding his word.&quot; The agency's lawyer said that they could not accept a verdict which &quot;does not coincide with freedom of the press.&quot;

===Dispute over Estonian war memorial===
During a heated dispute between Russia and Estonia in May 2007 over [[Bronze Night|the removal of a Soviet-era war memorial]] from the centre of the Estonian capital [[Tallinn]] to a military cemetery, Schröder defended the Kremlin's reaction. He remarked that Estonia had contradicted &quot;every form of civilised behaviour&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/daily/columns/europeview/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9142057&amp;fsrc=nwl|title=How to fight back|work=[[The Economist]]|accessdate=10 May 2007|date=10 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the Estonian government cancelled a planned visit by Schröder in his function as chairman of Nord Stream AG.

'''Germany''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-uk-Germany.ogg|ˈ|dʒ|ɜr|m|ə|n|i}}), officially the '''Federal Republic of Germany''' ({{lang-de|Bundesrepublik Deutschland}}, {{IPA-de|ˈbʊndəsʁepuˌbliːk ˈdɔʏtʃlant|pron|De-Bundesrepublik_Deutschland.ogg}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Mangold, Max |title=Duden, Aussprachewörterbuch |edition=6th |year=1995 |publisher=Dudenverlag  |language=German |isbn= 9783411209163 |pages=271, 53f}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[federation|federal]] [[parliamentary republic]] in [[Europe]]. The country consists of [[Lands of Germany|16 states]] while the [[capital city|capital]] and [[List of cities in Germany by population|largest city]] is [[Berlin]]. Germany covers an area of 357,021&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With 81.8&amp;nbsp;million inhabitants, it is the most populous member state and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|largest economy]] in the [[European Union]]. It is one of the major political powers of the European continent and a technological leader in many fields.

A region named [[Germania]], inhabited by several [[Germanic people]]s, was [[Germania (book)|documented]] before AD&amp;nbsp;100. During the [[Migration Age]], the [[Germanic tribes]] expanded southward, and established successor kingdoms throughout much of [[Europe]]. Beginning in the 10th century, [[Germans|German]] territories formed a central part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;The Latin name ''Sacrum Imperium'' (Holy Empire) is documented as far back as 1157. The Latin name ''Sacrum Romanum Imperium'' (Holy Roman Empire) was first documented in 1254. The full name &quot;Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation&quot; (''Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation'') dates back to the 15th century.&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book | last = Zippelius| first = Reinhold| title = Kleine deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte: vom frühen Mittelalter bis zur Gegenwart| trans_title   = Brief German Constitutional History: from the Early Middle Ages to the Present| edition   = 7| origyear  = 1994| year  = 2006| publisher =Beck| location  = Munich| language  = German| isbn  = 9783406476389| page = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the [[Protestant Reformation]] while southern and western parts remained dominated by [[Roman Catholic]] denominations, with the two factions clashing in the [[Thirty Years' War]], marking the beginning of the Catholic–[[Protestant]] divide that has characterized German society ever since.&lt;ref name=&quot;georgetown1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/germany |title=Germany |work= |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |date= |accessdate=2011-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupied during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the rise of [[Pan-Germanism]] inside the [[German Confederation]] resulted in the unification of most of the German states into the [[unification of Germany|German Empire]] in 1871 which was [[Prussia]]n dominated. After the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]] and the subsequent military surrender in [[World War I]], the Empire was replaced by the [[Weimar Republic]] in 1918, and partitioned in the [[Versailles Treaty]]. Amidst the [[Great Depression]], the [[Third Reich]] was proclaimed in 1933. The latter period was marked by [[Fascism]] and the [[Second World War]]. After 1945, Germany was divided by [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|allied occupation]], and evolved into two states, [[East Germany]] and [[West Germany]]. In 1990 Germany was [[German reunification|reunified]].

Germany was a founding member of the [[European Communities|European Community]] in 1957, which became the EU in 1993. It is part of the [[Schengen Area]] and since 1999 a member of the [[eurozone]]. Germany is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[NATO]], the [[G8]], the [[G-20 major economies|G20]], the [[OECD]] and the [[Council of Europe]], and took a non-permanent seat on the [[UN Security Council]] for the 2011–2012 term.

It has the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|fourth largest economy]] by nominal [[GDP]] and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|fifth largest]] by [[purchasing power parity]]. It is the [[List of countries by exports|second largest exporter]] and [[List of countries by imports|third largest importer]] of goods. The country has developed a [[List of countries by Human Development Index|very high standard of living]] and a comprehensive system of [[social security]]. Germany has been the home of many influential [[Science and technology in Germany|scientists and inventors]], and is known for its [[Culture of Germany|cultural]] and [[politics of Germany|political]] [[history of Germany|history]].

==Etymology==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
{{Main|Names of Germany}}
The English word ''Germany'' derives from the Latin [[Germania]], which came into use after [[Julius Caesar]] adopted it for the peoples east of the [[Rhine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Schulze |first=Hagen |authorlink=Hagen Schulze |title=Germany: A New History |publisher= Harvard University Press |page=4 |year=1998 |isbn= 0-674-80688-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other languages it has [[Names of Germany|various names]].

The [[German language|German]] term ''Deutschland'' (originally ''diutisciu land'', &quot;the German lands&quot;) is derived from [[wikt:deutsch#German|''deutsch'']], descended from [[Old High German]] ''diutisc'' &quot;popular&quot; (i. e., belonging to the ''diot'' or ''diota'' &quot;people&quot;; originally used to distinguish the [[Vernacular|language of the common people]] from Latin and its Romance descendants). This in turn descends from [[Proto-Germanic]] [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/þiudiskaz|*''þiudiskaz'']] &quot;popular&quot; (see also the Latinised form [[Theodiscus]]), derived from [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/þeudō|*''þeudō'']], descended from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/tewtéh₂|*''tewtéh₂-'']] &quot;people&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lloyd|first=Albert L.|title=Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Althochdeutschen, Band II|year=1998|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht|location=Göttingen|isbn=3-525-20768-9|pages=699–704|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iKfYGNwwNVIC&amp;pg=PA523|coauthors=Lühr, Rosemarie; Springer, Otto|language=German}} (for ''diutisc'')

{{Main|History of Germany}}

===Germanic tribes and Frankish Empire===
{{Main|Germania|Migration Period}}
[[File:Imperium Romanum Germania.png|thumb|250px|left|Map of the [[Germania]] and the [[Roman Empire]]]]
The [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] are [[ethnogenesis|thought to date from]] the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] or the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]]. From southern Scandinavia and north Germany, they expanded south, east and west from the 1st century&amp;nbsp;BC, coming into contact with the [[Celt]]ic tribes of [[Gaul]] as well as [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], [[Balts|Baltic]], and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes in [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first =Jill N. |last = Claster |title =Medieval Experience: 300–1400 |publisher =New York University Press |year =1982 |page =35 |isbn=0-8147-1381-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Augustus]], the Roman General [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]] began to invade Germania (an area extending roughly from the [[Rhine]] to the [[Ural Mountains]]). In AD&amp;nbsp;9, three [[Roman legion]]s led by Varus were [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest|defeated]] by the [[Cheruscan]] leader [[Arminius]]. By AD&amp;nbsp;100, when [[Tacitus]] wrote ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the [[Limes Germanicus]]), occupying most of the area of modern Germany; Austria, southern [[Bavaria]] and the western [[Rhineland]], however, were Roman provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;9-13&quot;&gt;Fulbrook 1991, pp. 9–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 3rd century a number of large West Germanic tribes emerged: [[Alamanni]], [[Franks]], [[Chatti]], [[Saxons]], [[Frisii]], [[Sicambri]], and [[Thuringii]]. Around 260, the Germanic peoples broke into Roman-controlled lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |series= The Cambridge Ancient History |title =The crisis of empire, A.D. 193–337 |volume =12 |page =442 |isbn=0-521-30199-8 |first =Alan K. |last =Bowman |first2 =Peter |last2 =Garnsey |first3 =Averil |last3 =Cameron |publisher =Cambridge University Press |year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the invasion of the [[Huns]] in 375, and with the decline of Rome from 395, Germanic tribes moved further south-west. Simultaneously several large tribes formed in what is now Germany and displaced the smaller Germanic tribes. Large areas (known since the [[Merovingian]] period as [[Austrasia]]) were occupied by the [[Frankish Empire|Franks]], and Northern Germany was ruled by the Saxons and Slavs.&lt;ref name=&quot;9-13&quot;/&gt;

===Holy Roman Empire===
{{Main|Holy Roman Empire}}
[[File:Martin Luther by Lucas Cranach der Ältere.jpeg|thumb|140px|upright|left|[[Martin Luther]] initiated the [[Protestant Reformation]].]]

On 25 December 800, [[Charlemagne]] founded the [[Carolingian Empire]], which was [[Treaty of Verdun|divided in 843]].&lt;ref name=&quot;f11&quot;&gt;Fulbrook 1991, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The Holy Roman Empire resulted from the [[East Francia|eastern portion]] of this division. Its territory stretched from the [[Eider River]] in the north to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast in the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;f11&quot;/&gt; Under the reign of the [[Ottonian]] emperors (919–1024), several major [[Stem duchy|duchies]] were consolidated, and the German king was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] of these regions in 962. The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] under the reign of the [[Salian]] emperors (1024–1125), although the emperors lost power through the [[Investiture Controversy]].

Under the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors (1138–1254), the German princes increased their influence further south and east into territories inhabited by [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], preceding [[History of German settlement in Eastern Europe|German settlement]] in these areas and further east ''([[Ostsiedlung]])''. Northern German towns grew prosperous as members of the [[Hanseatic League]].&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook 1991, pp. 13–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with the [[Great Famine of 1315–1317|Great Famine]] in 1315, then the [[Black Death]] of 1348–50, the population of Germany plummeted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url =http://www.vlib.us/medieval/lectures/black_death.html |title =The Great Famine (1315–1317) and the Black Death (1346–1351) |first =Lynn Harry |last =Nelson |publisher =University of Kansas |accessdate =19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The edict of the [[Golden Bull of 1356|Golden Bull]] in 1356 provided the basic constitution of the empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven [[prince-elector]]s who ruled some of the most powerful principalities and archbishoprics.&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook 1991, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Luther]] publicised his [[The 95 Theses|95 Theses]] in 1517, challenging the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and initiating the [[Protestant Reformation]]. A separate [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church became the official religion in many German states after 1530. Religious conflict led to the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648), which devastated German lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Philpott|first=Daniel|title=The Religious Roots of Modern International Relations|journal=World Politics|date=January 2000|volume=52|issue=2|pages=206–245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population of the German states was reduced by about 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title =The savage wars of peace: England, Japan and the Malthusian trap |first =Alan |last= Macfarlane |publisher =Blackwell |year = 1997 |page=51 | isbn= 9780631181170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648) ended religious warfare among the German states, but the empire was ''de facto'' divided into numerous independent principalities. From 1740 onwards, [[German dualism|dualism]] between the Austrian [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] dominated German history. In 1806, the ''Imperium'' was overrun and dissolved as a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook 1991, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

===German Confederation and Empire===
{{Main|German Confederation|German Empire|Pan-Germanism}}
Following the fall of [[Napoleon I of France]], the [[Congress of Vienna]] convened in 1814 and founded the German Confederation (Deutscher Bund), a loose league of [[List of German Confederation member states|39 sovereign states]]. Disagreement with [[European Restoration|restoration]] politics partly led to the rise of [[Liberalism in Germany|liberal]] movements, followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]]. The ''[[Zollverein]]'', a tariff union, furthered economic unity in the German states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henderson |first=W. O. |title=The Zollverein |journal=History |date=January 1934 |volume=19 |issue=73 |pages=1–19 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-229X.1934.tb01791.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[nationalism|National]] and liberal ideals of the [[French Revolution]] gained increasing support among many, especially young, Germans. In the light of a [[Revolutions of 1848|series of revolutionary movements in Europe]], which established a republic [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|in France]], intellectuals and commoners started the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]]. King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] was offered the title of Emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, leading to a temporary setback for the movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;state&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Wernerprokla.jpg|thumb|Foundation of the German Empire in [[Versailles]], 1871. [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] is at the centre in a white uniform.]]
Conflict between King [[William I, German Emperor|William I]] of Prussia and the increasingly liberal parliament erupted over military reforms in 1862, and the king appointed [[Otto von Bismarck]] the new [[Prime Minister of Prussia]]. Bismarck successfully waged [[Second War of Schleswig|war on Denmark]] in 1864. Prussian victory in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866 enabled him to create the [[North German Federation]] (Norddeutscher Bund) and to exclude [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], formerly the leading German state, from the federation's affairs. After the French defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the German Empire was proclaimed 1871 in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], uniting all scattered parts of Germany except Austria ({{lang|de|[[Kleindeutsche Lösung|''Kleindeutschland'']]}}, or &quot;Lesser Germany&quot;). With almost two thirds of its territory and population, Prussia was the dominating constituent of the new state; the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] King of Prussia ruled as its concurrent Emperor, and Berlin became its capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;state&quot;/&gt; In the {{lang|de|''[[Gründerzeit]]''}} period following the [[unification of Germany]], Bismarck's foreign policy as [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] of Germany under Emperor William I secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances, isolating [[French Third Republic|France]] by diplomatic means, and avoiding war. Under [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], however, Germany, like other European powers, took an [[New Imperialism|imperialistic]] course leading to friction with neighbouring countries. As a result of the [[Berlin Conference]] in 1884 Germany claimed several [[List of former German colonies|colonies]] including [[German East Africa]], [[German South-West Africa]], [[Togoland|Togo]], and [[Cameroon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=100 maps |year=2005 |publisher=Sterling Publishing |isbn=9781402728853 |editor=Black, John |page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most alliances in which Germany had previously been involved were not renewed, and new alliances excluded the country.&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook 1991, pp. 135, 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Austria's crown prince]] on 28 June 1914 triggered [[World War I]]. Germany, as part of the [[Central Powers]], suffered defeat against the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in [[World War I casualties|one of the bloodiest]] conflicts of all time. An estimated two million German soldiers died in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,530319,00.html |title = Last German World War I Veteran Believed to Have Died |work =Spiegel Online |date =22 January 2008 |first =David |last =Crossland |accessdate=25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|German Revolution]] broke out in November 1918, and Emperor Wilhelm II and all German ruling princes [[abdication|abdicated]]. An [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|armistice]] ended the war on 11 November, and Germany was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in June 1919. The treaty was perceived in Germany as a humiliating continuation of the war, and is often cited as an influence in the rise of [[Nazism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first =Stephen J. |last =Lee |title =Europe, 1890–1945 |publisher =Routledge |year =2003 |page =131 |isbn = 9780415254557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the German Revolution in November 1918, Germany was declared a [[republic]]. However, the struggle for power continued, with radical-left communists [[Bavarian Socialist Republic|seizing power in Bavaria]]. The revolution came to an end on 11 August 1919, when the democratic [[Weimar Constitution]] was signed by [[President of Germany|President]] [[Friedrich Ebert]].&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook 1991, pp. 156–160.&lt;/ref&gt; Suffering from the [[Great Depression]] of 1929, the harsh peace conditions dictated by the Treaty of Versailles, and a long succession of unstable governments, Germans increasingly lacked identification with the government. This was exacerbated by a widespread right-wing {{lang|de|''[[Dolchstoßlegende]]''}}, or stab-in-the-back myth, which argued that Germany had lost World War I because of those who wanted to overthrow the government. The Weimar government was accused of betraying Germany by signing the Versailles Treaty. By 1932, the [[Communist Party of Germany|German Communist Party]] and the [[Nazi Party]] controlled the majority of parliament, fuelled by discontent with the Weimar government. After a series of unsuccessful cabinets, President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] appointed [[Adolf Hitler]] as [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor of Germany]] on 30 January 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook 1991, pp. 155–158, 172–177.&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February 1933 the [[Reichstag fire|Reichstag]] building went up in flames, and a consequent [[Reichstag Fire Decree|emergency decree]] abrogated basic citizens' rights.

In 1935, Germany reacquired control of the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]] and in 1936 military control of the [[Rhineland]], both of which had been lost in the Treaty of Versailles.&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook 1991, pp. 188–189.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, [[Austria]] was [[Anschluss|annexed]], and in 1939, [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]] was brought under German control. The [[invasion of Poland]] was prepared through the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop pact]] and [[Operation Himmler]]. On 1 September 1939 the German [[Wehrmacht]] launched a [[blitzkrieg]] on [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], which was swiftly occupied by Germany and by the Soviet [[Red Army]]. The UK and France declared war on Germany, marking the beginning of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fulbrook 190&quot;&gt;Fulbrook 1991, pp. 190–195.&lt;/ref&gt; As the war progressed, Germany and its [[Axis powers|allies]] quickly gained control of most of [[Occupied Europe|continental Europe]] and [[North Africa]], though plans to [[Battle of Britain|force the United Kingdom]] to an armistice or surrender failed. On 22 June 1941, Germany broke the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact and [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]]. [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]'s [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] led Germany to declare war on the United States. The [[Battle of Stalingrad]] forced the German army to retreat on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern front]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fulbrook 190&quot;/&gt; In September 1943, Germany's ally Italy surrendered, and German troops were forced to defend an additional front in Italy.

After the surrender of Germany, the remaining German territory and Berlin were partitioned by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] into four military occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the ''[[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]'' (''Bundesrepublik Deutschland''); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the ''[[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]'' (''Deutsche Demokratische Republik'', or DDR). They were informally known as &quot;West Germany&quot; and &quot;East Germany&quot;. East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose [[Bonn]] as a provisional capital,  to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was an artificial and temporary ''status quo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wise | first = Michael Z. | title = Capital dilemma: Germany's search for a new architecture of democracy| year = 1998| publisher = Princeton Architectural Press | isbn =978-1-56898-134-5 | page = 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

West Germany, established as a federal parliamentary republic with a &quot;[[social market economy]]&quot;, was allied with the United States, the UK and France. The country enjoyed prolonged economic growth beginning in the early 1950s ({{lang|de|''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]''}}). West Germany joined [[NATO]] in 1955 and was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] in 1957. East Germany was an [[Eastern bloc]] state under political and military control by the [[USSR]] via the latter's occupation forces and the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Though East Germany claimed to be a democracy, political power was exercised solely by leading members (''[[Politburo|Politbüro]]'') of the communist-controlled [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED), supported by the [[Stasi]], an immense secret service,&lt;ref name=&quot;spiegel_20080311&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,540771,00.html|title = New Study Finds More Stasi Spooks|author = maw/dpa|date = 11 March 2008|work = Spiegel Online – english site (www.spiegel.de/international)|publisher = [[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate  = 30 October 2011|quote = 189,000 people were informers for the Stasi – the former Communist secret police – when East Germany collapsed in 1989 – 15,000 more than previous studies had suggested.

Tensions between East and West Germany were reduced in the early 1970s by [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Willy Brandt]]'s {{lang|de|''[[Ostpolitik]]''}}. In summer 1989, Hungary decided to dismantle the [[Iron Curtain]] and open the borders, causing the emigration of thousands of [[East Germans]] to West Germany via Hungary. This had devastating effects on the [[East Germany|GDR]], where regular [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|mass demonstrations]] received increasing support. The East German authorities unexpectedly eased the border restrictions, allowing East German citizens to travel to the West; originally intended to help retain East Germany as a state, the opening of the border actually led to an acceleration of the [[Die Wende|''Wende'' reform process]]. This culminated in the ''[[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|Two Plus Four Treaty]]'' a year later on 12 September 1990, under which the four occupying powers renounced their rights under the [[German Instrument of Surrender|Instrument of Surrender]], and Germany regained full sovereignty. This permitted [[German reunification]] on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the five re-established states of the former GDR ([[New states of Germany|new states]] or &quot;neue Länder&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;state&quot;/&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Germany}}
[[File:Deutschland topo.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|Topographic map]]

Germany is in Western and Central Europe, bordering [[Denmark]] in the north, [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]] in the east, [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] in the south, [[France]] and [[Luxembourg]] in the south-west, and [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] in the north-west. It lies mostly between latitudes [[47th parallel north|47°]] and [[55th parallel north|55° N]] (the tip of [[Sylt]] is just north of 55°), and longitudes [[5th meridian east|5°]] and [[16th meridian east|16° E]]. The territory covers {{convert|357021|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, consisting of {{convert|349223|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of land and {{convert|7798|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of water. It is the seventh largest country by area in Europe and the [[List of countries by area|62nd largest in the world]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt;

Elevation ranges from the mountains of the [[Alps]] (highest point: the [[Zugspitze]] at {{convert|2962|m|ft|0|disp=s}}) in the south to the shores of the [[North Sea]] (Nordsee) in the north-west and the [[Baltic Sea]] (Ostsee) in the north-east. The forested uplands of central Germany and the lowlands of northern Germany (lowest point: [[Wilstermarsch]] at {{convert|3.54|m|ft|1|disp=s}} below sea level) are traversed by such major rivers as the [[Rhine]], [[Danube]] and [[Elbe]].  Glaciers are found in the Alpine region, but are experiencing deglaciation. Significant natural resources are iron ore, coal, [[potash]], timber, [[lignite]], [[uranium]], copper, natural gas, salt, nickel, [[arable land]] and water.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gm.html| title = World Factbook | accessdate = 26 March 2011|publisher=CIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
Most of Germany has a [[temperate|temperate seasonal climate]] in which humid westerly winds predominate. The climate is moderated by the [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]], the northern extension of the [[Gulf Stream]]. This warmer water affects the areas bordering the North Sea; consequently in the north-west and the north the climate is [[oceanic climate|oceanic]]. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Rainfall]] occurs year-round, especially in the summer. Winters are mild and summers tend to be cool, though temperatures can exceed {{convert|30|°C|°F|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;climate&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate in Germany|url=http://www.germanculture.com.ua/library/facts/bl_climate.htm|publisher=GermanCulture|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The east has a more [[continental climate]]; winters can be very cold and summers very warm, and long dry periods are frequent. Central and southern Germany are transition regions which vary from moderately oceanic to continental. In addition to the maritime and continental climates that predominate over most of the country, the Alpine regions in the extreme south and, to a lesser degree, some areas of the Central German Uplands have a mountain climate, characterised by lower temperatures and greater precipitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;climate&quot;/&gt;

Plants and animals are those generally common to middle Europe. Beeches, oaks, and other deciduous trees constitute one third of the forests; conifers are increasing as a result of reforestation. Spruce and fir trees predominate in the upper mountains, while pine and larch are found in sandy soil. There are many species of ferns, flowers, fungi, and mosses. Wild animals include deer, wild boar, mouflon, fox, badger, hare, and small numbers of beavers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Bekker |first=Henk |title=Adventure Guide Germany |year=2005 |publisher=Hunter |isbn =9781588435033 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reichstag building Berlin view from west before sunset.jpg|thumb|left|270px|The [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] in Berlin is the site of the German parliament (Bundestag).]]

Germany is a [[federal republic|federal]], [[parliamentary democratic|parliamentary]], [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic. The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitutional document known as the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|''Grundgesetz'']] (Basic Law). Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both chambers of parliament; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the rule of law are valid in perpetuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.btg-bestellservice.de/pdf/80201000.pdf|title=Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|date=October 2010|work=Deutscher Bundestag|publisher=Btg-bestellservice|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[President of Germany|president]] is the [[head of state]] and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. He is elected by the ''[[Bundesversammlung (Germany)|Bundesversammlung]]'' (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the ''Bundestag'' and an equal number of state delegates. The second-highest official in the [[German order of precedence]] is the ''Bundestagspräsident'' ([[President of the Bundestag|President of the ''Bundestag'']]), who is elected by the ''Bundestag'' and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body. The third-highest official and the [[head of government]] is the Chancellor, who is appointed by the ''Bundespräsident'' after being elected by the ''Bundestag''.&lt;ref name=&quot;state&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Bundespräsidentenpaar 9694.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Christian Wulff]] (right) was the most recent President of Germany. The office is currently vacant.]]

The chancellor, currently [[Angela Merkel]], is the head of government and exercises [[executive (government)|executive power]], similar to the role of a Prime Minister in other parliamentary democracies. Federal [[legislative power]] is vested in the parliament consisting of the ''[[Bundestag]]'' (Federal Diet) and ''[[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]'' (Federal Council), which together form the legislative body. The ''Bundestag'' is elected through [[direct election]]s, by [[proportional representation]] ([[mixed member proportional representation|mixed-member]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt; The members of the ''Bundesrat'' represent the governments of the sixteen federated states and are members of the state cabinets.&lt;ref name=&quot;state&quot;/&gt;

Since 1949, the party system has been dominated by the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] with all chancellors hitherto being member of either party. However, the smaller liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (which has had members in the ''Bundestag'' since 1949) and the [[Alliance '90/The Greens]] (which has controlled seats in parliament since 1983) have also played important roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/germany/159.htm|title=Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany has a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law system]] based on [[Roman law]] with some references to [[Germanic law]]. The ''[[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Bundesverfassungsgericht]]'' (Federal Constitutional Court) is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of [[judicial review]].&lt;ref name=&quot;state&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/en/index.html|title=Federal Constitutional Court|publisher=Bundesverfassungsgericht|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's supreme court system, called ''Oberste Gerichtshöfe des Bundes'', is specialised: for civil and criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the [[inquisitorial system|inquisitorial]] [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|Federal Court of Justice]], and for other affairs the courts are the [[Federal Labor Court of Germany|Federal Labour Court]], the [[Bundessozialgericht|Federal Social Court]], the [[Federal Finance Court of Germany|Federal Finance Court]] and the [[Federal Administrative Court of Germany|Federal Administrative Court]].

Germany comprises [[States of Germany|sixteen states]] that are collectively referred to as ''Länder''.&lt;ref&gt;The individual denomination is either ''Land'' [state], ''Freistaat'' [free state] or ''Freie (und) Hansestadt'' [free (and) Hanseatic city].&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bundesrat.de/nn_11006/EN/organisation-en/laender-en/laender-en-node.html?__nnn=true|title= The Federal States|publisher=[[Bundesrat of Germany]]|work = www.bundesrat.de|accessdate=17 July 2011}} &lt;br/&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/DE/Infoservice/Terminologie/Bundeslaender/Uebersicht_node.html|title = Amtliche Bezeichnung der Bundesländer|work = www.auswaertiges-amt.de|publisher = [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Federal Foreign Office]]|language = German|trans_title = Official denomination of federated states|format = PDF; download file „Englisch“|accessdate = 22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to differences in size and population the [[States of Germany#Further subdivisions|subdivision of these states]] varies, especially between [[city states]] (''Stadtstaaten'') and states with larger territories (''Flächenländer''). For regional administrative purposes five states, namely Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony, consist of a total of 22 [[Regierungsbezirke|Government Districts]] (''Regierungsbezirke''). {{As of|2009}} Germany is divided into 403 [[Districts of Germany|districts]] (''Kreise'') on municipal level, these consist of 301 [[List of rural districts of Germany|rural districts]] and 102 [[Urban districts of Germany|urban districts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.destatis.de/jetspeed/portal/cms/Sites/destatis/Internet/DE/Content/Statistiken/Regionales/Gemeindeverzeichnis/Administrativ/Aktuell/04__KreiseAktuell,property=file.xls|title=Kreisfreie Städte und Landkreise nach Fläche und Bevölkerung 31.12.2009|format=XLS|month=October|year=2010|publisher=[[Statistisches Bundesamt]] Deutschland|language=German|accessdate=26 September 2011}}{{dead link|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Germany}}

German is the official and predominant spoken language in Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurobarometer Languages&quot;/&gt; It is one of 23 official languages in the European Union, and one of the three [[working language]]s of the [[European Commission]]. Recognised native minority languages in Germany are Danish, [[Low German]], [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]], [[Romany language|Romany]], and [[Frisian languages|Frisian]]; they are officially protected by the [[ECRML]]. The most used immigrant languages are [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], Polish, the [[Balkan languages]], and Russian; 67% of German citizens claim to be able to communicate in at least one foreign language and 27% in at least two languages other than their own.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurobarometer Languages&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Eurobarometer 243: Europeans and their Languages (Survey)|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[European Commission]]|year=2006|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf| accessdate= 28 March 2011}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Eurobarometer 243: Europeans and their Languages (Executive Summary)|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[European Commission]]|year=2006|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_sum_en.pdf |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard German is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] and is closely related to and classified alongside English, [[Low German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and the Frisian languages. To a lesser extent, it is also related to the [[East Germanic languages|East]] (extinct) and [[North Germanic languages]]. Most German vocabulary is derived from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Many tongues, one family. Languages in the European Union|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[European Commission]] |year=2004|url=http://ec.europa.eu/publications/booklets/move/45/en.pdf |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant minorities of words are derived from Latin and Greek, with a smaller amount from French and most recently English (known as [[Denglisch]]). German is written using the Latin alphabet. German [[dialect]]s, traditional local varieties traced back to the Germanic tribes, are distinguished from [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of [[standard German]] by their [[lexicon]], [[phonology]], and [[syntax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sprechen Sie Deutsch? |url=http://www.economist.com/node/15731354 |accessdate=16 April 2011 |newspaper=The Economist |date=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Germany}}
[[File:Heidelberg Universitätsbibliothek 2003.jpg|thumb|left|The [[University of Heidelberg]] was established in 1386.]]
Over 99% of Germans age 15 and above are estimated to be able to read and write.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt; However, a growing number of inhabitants are functionally illiterate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vhs-sachsen.de/uploads/media/Executive_Summary_leo_v8_Journalismusfassung.pdf |title=leo.- Level One Survey.

Since the 1960s, a reform movement attempted to unify secondary education in a ''Gesamtschule'' ([[comprehensive school]]); several West German states later simplified their school system to two or three tiers. A system of apprenticeship called ''Duale Ausbildung'' (&quot;dual education&quot;) allows pupils in [[vocational training]] to learn in a company as well as in a state-run vocational school.&lt;ref name=&quot;ED&quot;/&gt;

Optional [[kindergarten]] education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is [[compulsory education|compulsory]] for at least nine years. Primary education usually lasts for four years and public schools are not stratified at this stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;ED&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Germany.pdf |title=Country profile: Germany |publisher=Library of Congress |date=April 2008 |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, secondary education includes three traditional types of schools focused on different levels of academic ability: the ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' enrols the most gifted children and prepares students for university studies; the ''[[Realschule]]'' for intermediate students lasts six years; the ''[[Hauptschule]]'' prepares pupils for vocational education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.cuesta.edu/intlang/german/education.html |title=The Educational System in Germany |publisher=Cuesta College |date=31 August 2002 |accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general entrance requirement for university is [[Abitur]], a qualification normally based on continuous assessment during the last few years at school and final examinations; however there are a number of exceptions, and precise requirements vary, depending on the state, the university and the subject. Germany's universities are recognised internationally; in the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]] (ARWU) for 2008, six of the top 100 universities in the world are in Germany, and 18 of the top 200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 100 World Universities|publisher=[[Academic Ranking of World Universities]] |url=http://www.arwu.org/rank2008/ARWU2008_A(EN).htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080822124509/http://www.arwu.org/rank2008/ARWU2008_A(EN).htm |archivedate=2008-08-22 |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all German universities are public institutions, charging tuition fees of €50–500 per semester for each student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studyineurope.eu/study-in-germany/admission/tuition-fees|title=Tuition Fees at university in Germany|publisher=StudyinEurope.eu|year=2009|accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous German painters have enjoyed international prestige through their work in diverse artistic styles. [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Matthias Grünewald]], and [[Albrecht Dürer]] were important artists of the [[Renaissance]], [[Caspar David Friedrich]] of [[Romanticism]], and [[Max Ernst]] of [[Surrealism]]. Architectural contributions from Germany include the [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian architecture|Ottonian styles]], which were precursors of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]. The region later became the site of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] art. Germany was particularly important in the early [[modern architecture|modern movement]], especially through the [[Bauhaus]] movement founded by [[Walter Gropius]]. [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] became one of the world's most renowned architects in the second half of the 20th century. He conceived of the glass façade skyscraper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2006|title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=880|isbn=0-19-860678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[German literature]] can be traced back to the Middle Ages and the works of writers such as [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] and [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]. Well-known German authors include [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]]. The collections of folk tales published by the [[Brothers Grimm]] popularised [[German folklore]] on an international level.

German philosophy is historically significant. [[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s contributions to [[rationalism]]; the establishment of classical [[German idealism]] by [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]]; [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s composition of metaphysical pessimism; the formulation of [[communist theory]] by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]; [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s development of [[perspectivism]]; [[Gottlob Frege]]'s contributions to the dawn of [[analytic philosophy]]; [[Martin Heidegger]]'s works on Being; and the development of the [[Frankfurt school]] by [[Max Horkheimer]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]] have been particularly influential. In the 21st century Germany has contributed to the development of contemporary analytic philosophy in continental Europe, along with France, Austria, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Searle, John|year=1987|title=The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy|chapter=Introduction|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 the Austrian-American [[Josef von Sternberg]] directed ''[[The Blue Angel]]'', the first major German [[sound film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Bordwell |first= David |authorlink= David Bordwell |coauthors= Thompson, Kristin |title= Film History: An Introduction |origyear= 1994 |edition= 2nd |year= 2003 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn= 978-0-07-115141-2 |page= 204 |chapter= The Introduction of Sound}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s and 1980s, [[New German Cinema]] directors such as [[Volker Schlöndorff]], [[Werner Herzog]], [[Wim Wenders]], and [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]] put West German cinema on the international stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fassbinderfoundation.de/node.php/en/home|title=Rainer Werner Fassbinder|publisher=Fassbinder Foundation|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The annual [[European Film Award]]s ceremony is held every other year in Berlin, home of the [[European Film Academy]] (EFA); the [[Berlin Film Festival]], held annually since 1951, is one of the world's foremost film festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiapf.org/pdf/2006accreditedFestivalsDirectory.pdf |title=2006 FIAPF accredited Festivals Directory|publisher=International Federation of Film Producers Associations|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, films such as ''[[Good Bye Lenin!]]'' (2003), ''[[Head-On|Gegen die Wand (Head-on)]]'' (2004), ''[[Der Untergang|Der Untergang (Downfall)]]'' (2004), and ''[[Der Baader Meinhof Komplex]]'' (2008) have had international success.

German cuisine varies from region to region. The southern regions of [[Bavarian cuisine|Bavaria]] and Swabia, for instance, share a culinary culture with Switzerland and Austria.  In all regions, meat is often eaten in sausage form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.foodfromgermany.org/consumer/facts/guidetosausages.cfm | title = Guide to German Sausages &amp; Meat Products | publisher = German Foods North America | accessdate = 11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Organic food]] has gained a market share of ca. 2%, and is expected to increase further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fao.org/organicag/display/work/display_2.asp?country=DEU&amp;lang=en&amp;disp=summaries | title =Germany Country Profiles for Organic Agriculture | publisher= Food and Agriculture Organization | accessdate = 6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although wine is becoming more popular in many parts of Germany, the national alcoholic drink is beer.

'''Guido Westerwelle''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡiːdo ˈvɛstɐˌvɛlə}}; born December 27, 1961) is a [[Germany|German]] liberal politician, who, since 28 October 2009, has been serving as the [[Foreign Minister of Germany|Foreign Minister]] in the [[Cabinet Merkel II|second cabinet]] of Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]], and who was [[Vice Chancellor of Germany]] from 2009 to 2011. He is the first [[openly gay]] person to hold either of those positions. He has been the chairman of the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party of Germany]] (FDP) since May 2001, but stepped down in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2011-04/fdp-westerwelle-parteivorsitz-2 &quot;Westerwelle gibt den FDP-Vorsitz ab&quot;] ''Die Zeit''  (April 3, 2011) {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lawyer by profession, he has been a member of the [[Bundestag]] since 1996.

==Early life and education==
Guido Westerwelle was born in [[Bad Honnef]] in the German state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. He graduated from [[Ernst Moritz Arndt]] [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in 1980 after academic struggles resulted in his departure from previous institutions where he was considered an average student at best, but substandard otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;[Vgl. Setzen, Sechs! - Schulgeschichten aus Deutschland (3/3). Experiment Schule. Dokumentarfilm von Susanne Bausch im Auftrag des SWR. Deutsche Erstausstrahlung am 22. Dezember 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He studied law at the [[University of Bonn]] from 1980 to 1987. Following the First and Second State Law Examinations in 1987 and 1991 respectively, he began practicing as an attorney in [[Bonn]] in 1991. In 1994, he earned a doctoral degree in law from [[FernUniversität Hagen]].

==Career in the FDP==
Westerwelle joined the FDP in 1980. He was a founding member of the ''[[Young Liberals (Germany)|Junge Liberale]]'', the youth organization of that party, and was its chairman from 1983 to 1988. 

Having been a member of the Executive Board of the FDP since 1988, he first gained national prominence in 1994, when he was appointed Secretary General of the party. As such, he was a notable proponent of an unlimited [[free market]] economy and took a leading part in drafting a new party programme. 

In 1996, Westerwelle was first elected a member of the Bundestag, filling in for Heinz Lanfermann, who had resigned from his seat after entering the Ministry of Justice. In 1998, Westerwelle was re-elected to parliament.

In 2001, he succeeded [[Wolfgang Gerhardt]] as party chairman, who, however, remained chairman of the FDP's parliamentary group. Westerwelle, the youngest party chairman at the time, emphasized economics and education, and espoused a strategy initiated by his deputy [[Jürgen Möllemann]], who, as chairman of the [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] branch of party, had led his party back into the state parliament, gaining 9.8% of the vote. This strategy, transferred to the federal level, was dubbed ''Project 18'',  referring both to the envisioned percentage and the German age of majority. Leading up to the 2002 elections, he positioned his party in ''equidistance'' to the major parties and refused to commit his party to a coalition with either the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democrats]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]]. He was also declared the FDP's candidate for the office of [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|chancellor]]. Since the FDP had never claimed such a candicacy (and hasn't done since) and had no chance of attaining it against the two major parties, this move was widely seen as flippant political marketing alongside other moves, such as driving around in a campaign van dubbed ''Guidomobile'', wearing the figure ''18'' on the soles of his shoes or appearance in the [[Big Brother (TV series)|''Big Brother'' TV show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=sueddeutsche.de GmbH, Munich, Germany |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/488/399272/text/ |title=FDP-Kanzlerkandidat - „Eher wird Pieper Päpstin als Westerwelle Kanzler“ - Deutschland |publisher=sueddeutsche.de |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the [[German federal election, 2002|federal elections]] yielded a slight increase of the FDP's vote from 6.8% to 7.4%. Despite this setback, he was reelected as party chairman in 2003.

In the [[German federal election, 2005|federal elections of 2005]], Westerwelle was his party's frontrunner. When neither Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]]'s Social Democrats and Greens nor a coalition of Christian and Free Democrats, favoured by [[Angela Merkel]] and Westerwelle, managed to gain a majority of seats, Westerwelle rejected overtures by Chancellor Schröder to save his chancellorship by entering his coalition, preferring to become one of the leaders of the disparate opposition of the subsequently formed &quot;Grand Coalition&quot; of Christian and Social Democrats, with Merkel as Chancellor. Westerwelle became a vocal critic of the new government. In 2006, according to an internal agreement, Westerwelle succeeded Wolfgang Gerhardt as chairman of the parliamentary group.

==Foreign Minister and Vice Chancellor of Germany==
In the [[German federal election, 2009|federal elections of 2009]], Westerwelle committed his party to a coalition with Dr Merkel's CDU/CSU, ruling out a coalition with Social Democrats and Greens, and led his party to unprecedented 14.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/en/bundestagswahlen/BTW_BUND_09/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/index.html |title=Übersicht |publisher=Bundeswahlleiter.de |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with earlier announcements, he formed a coalition government with CDU/CSU. On October 28, he was sworn in as [[Foreign Minister of Germany|Foreign Minister]] and [[Vice Chancellor of Germany|Vice-Chancellor]], becoming the head of the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Foreign Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Handelsblatt, Düsseldorf, Germany |url=http://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/der-schwarz-gelbe-showdown-beginnt;2469840 |title=Der schwarz-gelbe Showdown beginnt - Politik - Deutschland |publisher=Handelsblatt.com |date=2009-10-16 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE58Q27P20090927 |title=German elections seen triggering brief stocks rally |publisher=Reuters |date=2009-09-27 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6848166.ece ]{{dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 he announced he wouldn't be taking his husband to hostile countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.de/politics/20100811-29089.html &quot;Westerwelle won't take partner to anti-gay lands&quot;], The Local.

His deputies at the Foreign Office are [[Werner Hoyer]] and [[Cornelia Pieper]] as Ministers of State. Hoyer previously held the same office in the [[Cabinet Kohl V]].

By May 2011 however his party had collapsed in several states, including [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] and [[Bremen]] where they failed to secure the 5% threshold to be seated in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/may/25/germany-liberal-collapse-free-democrats &quot;Germany's liberal collapse parallels Clegg's fate&quot;], Hans Kundnani. The Guardian. May 25, 2011. Accessed June 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Westerwelle then stepped down as party leader. By July the party was only receiving 3% support in opinion polls, a record low,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agi.it/english-version/world/elenco-notizie/201107271553-pol-ren1058-german_liberals_collapse_to_3_percent &quot;GERMAN LIBERALS COLLAPSE TO 3 PERCENT&quot;], AGI. 27 july 2011. Retrieved 7 aug 2011&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting what political insiders had called his &quot;last stand&quot; in January, comparing Westerwelle and his party to [[Ahab (Moby-Dick)|Captain Ahab]] and the [[Pequod (Moby-Dick)|Pequod]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,738173,00.html &quot;Guido Westerwelle's Last Stand&quot;], Rolland Nelles.

In July 2011 Westerwelle was the [[President of the United Nations Security Council]] as he headed the German delegation to the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2011/sc10325.doc.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positions==
Westerwelle is a staunch supporter of the [[free-market economy|free market]] and has proposed reforms to curtail the German [[welfare state]] and deregulate German labor law. In an interview in February 2003, Westerwelle described [[trade unions]] as a &quot;plague on our country&quot; and said union officials were &quot;the pall bearers of the welfare state and of the prosperity in our country&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;brinkmann&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Controversy==
His chairmanship has also seen considerable controversy. Critics inside and outside the FDP have accused him of focusing on [[public relations]], as opposed to developing and promoting sound [[policy|public policy]], especially in the election campaign of 2002. Westerwelle himself, who was made party chairman particularly because his predecessor [[Wolfgang Gerhardt]] had been viewed by many as dull and stiff, has labeled his approach as ''Spaßpolitik'' (fun politics) in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1918826,00.html |date=2009-09-07 |title= Guido Westerwelle, Germany's Mittelman |work=''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' |accessdate=2010-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.welt.de/print-welt/article239101/Der_Samurai_der_Spasspolitik.html?print=yes |date=2003-07-03 |title= Der Samurai der Spaßpolitik |work=''[[Die Welt|Welt Online]]'' |accessdate=2008-04-09 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

On September 27, 2009, at a press conference after the election, Westerwelle refused to answer a question in English from a BBC reporter, stating that &quot;it is normal to speak German in Germany&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.de/politics/20090928-22217.html |title=Future foreign minister Westerwelle refuses to answer English question |publisher=thelocal.de |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/14558508 Off to the Auswärtiges Amt] ''[[The Economist]]'' 1 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

He made public statements in 2010 about the &quot;welfare state&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,678319,00.html |title=Dekadenz-Sprüche: Westerwelles explosives Oppositions-Recycling - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Nachrichten - Politik |publisher=Spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that promising the people effortless prosperity may lead to &quot;late Roman decadence&quot;, in reference to a verdict in the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] regarding [[Hartz IV]]. This caused quite a stir in Germany.

His official trips as foreign minister have included his partner Michael Mronz, an event manager, and Ralf Marohn, a partner in his brother's company,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,684722,00.html |title=Liberaler Klüngel: FDP-Reiseaffäre |publisher=Spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; also causing controversy. Westerwelle and the FDP defended this by saying that it is normal for foreign ministers to take industry representatives on their trips, ignoring the fact that these particular representatives had a personal [[cronyism|relationship]] with him.

In late November 2010, [[United States diplomatic cables leak|leaked U.S. diplomatic cables]] revealed that American diplomats considered Westerwelle an obstacle to deeper [[Germany – United States relations|transatlantic]] relations and were skeptical of Westerwelle's abilities, with one cable comparing Westerwelle unfavorably to former German foreign minister [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,731645-2,00.html|title=How America Views the Germans|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=30 November 2010 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Ministry and the Past===
In 2010, the Foreign Ministry released a report prepared for Westerwelle called [[The Ministry and the Past]], which alleged the ministry's collusion with the Nazis. Westerwelle said the report &quot;shamed&quot; the institution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/german-fm-shamed-by-ministry-s-collaboration-with-hitler-1.321627 &quot;German FM 'shamed' by ministry's collaboration with Hitler&quot;], Haaretz. May 28, 2010. Accessed June 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Espionage===
On December 3, 2010, Westerwelle dismissed his personal assistant Helmut Metzner following a [[Wikileaks]] diplomatic cables release which led to Metzner admitting that he regularly spied for the Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://euobserver.com/9/31416|title=Heads start rolling in WikiLeaks affair

'''Hamburg''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|h|æ|m|b|ɜr|ɡ}}; {{IPA-de|ˈhambʊɐ̯k}}, local pronunciation {{IPA-dedia|ˈhambʊɪç|}}; [[Low German]]/[[West Low German|Low Saxon]]: ''Hamborg'' {{IPA-dedia|ˈhaˑmbɔːx|}}) is the [[List of cities in Germany with more than 100,000 inhabitants|second-largest city]] in [[Germany]] and the [[Largest cities of the European Union by population within city limits|seventh-largest city]] in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citymayors.com/features/euro_cities1.html |title=Europe's largest cities |work=City Mayors Statistics |accessdate=2009-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is home to over 1.8 million people, while the [[Hamburg Metropolitan Region]] (including parts of the neighbouring [[States of Germany|Federal States]] of [[Lower Saxony]] and [[Schleswig-Holstein]]) has more than 4.3 million inhabitants. Situated on the river [[Elbe]], the [[port of Hamburg]] is the second largest port in Europe (after the Port of [[Port of Rotterdam|Rotterdam]]) and it is among the twenty largest in the world.

Hamburg's official name is the '''''Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg''''' (German: ''Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg'').&lt;ref name=constitution&gt;[[Constitution of Hamburg]] {{Citation |title=Verfassung der Freien und Hansestadt Hamburg |url=http://hh.juris.de/hh/gesamt/Verf_HA.htm#Verf_HA_rahmen |date=1952-06-06 |edition=11th |accessdate=2008-09-21}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reflects [[History of Hamburg|Hamburg's history]] as a member of the medieval [[Hanseatic League]], as a [[free imperial city]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and that Hamburg is a [[city-state]] and one of the sixteen States of Germany.

Hamburg is a major [[transport hub]] in [[Northern Germany]] and is one of the most [[Affluency|affluent]] cities in Europe.{{citation}} It has become a media and industrial centre, with plants and facilities belonging to ''[[Airbus]]'', ''[[Blohm + Voss]]'' and ''[[Aurubis]]''. The radio and television broadcaster ''[[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]]'' and publishers such as ''[[Gruner + Jahr]]'' and ''[[Der Spiegel|Spiegel]]-Verlag'' are pillars of the important media industry in Hamburg. In total, there are more than 120,000 enterprises.

The city is a major tourist destination for both domestic and overseas visitors; Hamburg ranked 23rd in the world for livability in 2009,&lt;ref name=&quot;theage.com.au&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/executive-style/culture/melbourne-pips-sydney-again-in-livability-stakes-20090617-chzy.html |location=Melbourne |work=The Age |first=Paola |last=Totaro |title=Melbourne pips Sydney again in livability stakes |date=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; higher in some alternate rankings&lt;ref name=&quot;theage.com.au&quot;/&gt; and in 2010 the city ranked 10th in the world.

==Geography==
Hamburg is located on the southern point of the [[Jutland Peninsula]], directly between [[Continental Europe]] to its south, [[Scandinavia]] to its north, the [[North Sea]] to its west, and the [[Baltic Sea]] to its east. Hamburg is located on the River [[Elbe]] at its confluence with the [[Alster]] and [[Bille]]. The city centre is situated around the [[Binnenalster]] (&quot;Inner Alster&quot;) and [[Außenalster]] (&quot;Outer Alster&quot;) both of which were originally formed by impounding the River Alster to create lakes. The island of [[Neuwerk]] and two small neighbouring islands Scharhörn and Nigehörn, located in the [[Wadden Sea National Parks|Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park]], are also part of Hamburg.&lt;ref&gt;Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park Act {{Citation |title=Gesetz über den Nationalpark Hamburgisches Wattenmeer |url=http://www.landesrecht.hamburg.de/jportal/portal/page/bshaprod.psml?doc.id=jlr-WattMGHArahmen&amp;st=lr&amp;showdoccase=1&amp;paramfromHL=true#focuspoint|date=1990-04-09 |accessdate=2011-02-26}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neighbourhoods of [[Neuenfelde]], [[Cranz, Hamburg|Cranz]], Francop and [[Finkenwerder]] are part of the ''[[Altes Land]]'' region (old land), the biggest contiguous fruit-producing region in [[Central Europe]]. The neighbourhood of [[Neugraben-Fischbek]] has Hamburg's highest elevation, the [[Hasselbrack]] at {{convert|116.2|m|0}} [[Above mean sea level|AMSL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=''Geologisches Landesamt Hamburg'' (Hamburg State Geological Department) |title=Statistisches Jahrbuch 2007/2008 |year=2007 |publisher=Statistisches Amt für Hamburg und Schleswig-Holstein |location=Hamburg |issn=1614-8045}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
Hamburg has an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb''). Hamburg's climate is influenced by its proximity to the coast and marine air masses that originate over the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Nearby wetlands also enjoy a maritime temperate climate. Snowfall is rare, generally occurring once or twice a year.

The warmest months in Hamburg are June, July, and August, with high temperatures of {{convert|19.9|to|22.2|C|F}}. The coldest are December, January, and February, with low temperatures of {{convert|-1.4|to|0.0|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=WMO/&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Hamburg}}
[[File:Limes.saxoniae.wmt.png|thumb|The ''[[Limes Saxoniae]]'' border between the [[Saxons]] and the Slavic [[Obotrites]], established about 810.]]

The first historic name for the city was, according to [[Claudius Ptolemy]]'s reports, '''Treva'''.
But the city takes its modern name, Hamburg, from the first permanent building on the site, a castle whose construction was ordered by the Emperor [[Charlemagne]] in AD 808. The [[castle]] was built on rocky terrain in a marsh between the [[Alster|River Alster]] and the [[Elbe|River Elbe]] as a defence against [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] incursion. The castle was named ''Hammaburg'', ''burg'' meaning castle or fort. The origin of the ''Hamma'' term remains uncertain,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;cite id=Verg&gt;{{Citation |last1=Verg |first1=Erich |last2=Verg|first2=Martin|year=2007 |title=Das Abenteuer das Hamburg heißt |edition=4th |location=Hamburg |publisher=Ellert&amp;Richter |isbn=9783831901371 |page=8}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does the exact location of the castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hammaburg &amp;ndash; der große Irrtum |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2007/12/12/826430.html |date=2007-12-12 |publisher=Hamburg Abendblatt |accessdate=2008-09-30}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 834, Hamburg was designated the seat of a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Prince-Bishop|bishopric]], whose first bishop, [[Ansgar]], became known as the Apostle of the North. Two years later, Hamburg was united with [[Archdiocese of Bremen|Bremen]] as the bishopric of Hamburg-Bremen.&lt;ref name=verg15&gt;[[#Verg|Verg (2007)]], p.15&lt;/ref&gt; In 1529, the city embraced [[Lutheranism]], and Hamburg subsequently received [[Protestantism|Protestant]] refugees from the [[Netherlands]] and [[France]] and, in the 17th century, [[Portuguese Jewish community in Hamburg|Sephardi Jews]] from [[Portugal]].

Hamburg was destroyed and occupied several times. In 845, a fleet of 600 [[Viking]] ships sailed up the [[Elbe|River Elbe]] and destroyed Hamburg which, at that time, was a town of around 500 inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;verg15&quot;/&gt; In 1030, the city was burned down by King [[Mieszko II Lambert]] of [[Poland]]. [[Valdemar II of Denmark]] raided and occupied Hamburg in 1201 and in 1214. The [[Black Death]] killed at least 60% of Hamburg's population in 1350.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Snell |first=Melissa |url=http://historymedren.about.com/od/theblackdeath/a/greatmortality_2.htm |title=The Great Mortality |publisher=Historymedren.about.com |accessdate=2009-04-19 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamburg had several great fires, the most notable ones in 1284 and 1842. In 1842, about a quarter of the inner city was destroyed in the &quot;Great Fire&quot;. This conflagration started on the night of the 4 May 1842 and was extinguished on 8 May. It destroyed three churches, the town hall, and many other buildings, killing 51 people and leaving an estimated 20,000 homeless. Reconstruction took more than 40 years.

[[File:Jmdavid hamburg.jpg|thumb|Hamburg in 1811]]
In 1189, by imperial charter, [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I &quot;Barbarossa&quot;]] granted Hamburg the status of an [[Free imperial city|Imperial Free City]] and tax-free access up the Lower Elbe into the North Sea. In 1265, an allegedly forged letter was presented to or by the Rath of Hamburg.&lt;ref name=verg26&gt;[[#Verg|Verg (2007)]], p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; This charter, along with Hamburg's proximity to the main trade routes of the [[North Sea]] and [[Baltic Sea]], quickly made it a major port in [[Northern Europe]]. Its trade alliance with [[Lübeck]] in 1241 marks the origin and core of the powerful Hanseatic League of trading cities. On 8 November 1266, a contract between [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] and Hamburg's traders allowed them to establish a ''hanse'' in London. This was the first time in history that the word ''hanse'' was used for the trading guild of the [[Hanseatic League]].&lt;ref name=verg30&gt;[[#Verg|Verg (2007)]], p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The first description of civil, criminal and procedural law for a city in Germany in the German language, the ''Ordeelbook'' (''Ordeel'': sentence) was written by the solicitor of the [[senate of Hamburg]], ''Jordan von Boitzenburg'', in 1270.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Medieval Origins of Modern Legal Education: Between Church and State |first=David S. |last=Clark |journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law |volume=Vol. 35, No. 4 |year=1987 |pages=653–719 |publisher=American Society of Comparative Law |doi=10.2307/840129 |issue=4 |jstor=840129}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 10, 1410, civil unrest forced a compromise (German:''Rezeß'', literally meaning: withdrawal). This is considered the first [[constitution of Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Verg|Verg (2007)]], p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806, the [[Free imperial city|Free Imperial City]] of Hamburg was not incorporated into a larger administrative area while retaining special privileges ([[Mediatization|mediatised]]), but became a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] state with the official title of the ''Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg''. Hamburg was briefly annexed by [[Napoleon I]] to the [[First French Empire]] (1810–14). Russian forces under [[Levin August, Count von Bennigsen|General Bennigsen]] finally freed the city in 1814. Hamburg reassumed its pre-1811 status as a city-state in 1814. The [[Congress of Vienna|Vienna Congress]] of 1815 confirmed Hamburg's independence and it became one of 39 sovereign states of the [[German Confederation]] (1815&amp;ndash;66).

In 1860, the state of Hamburg adopted a republican constitution. Hamburg became a city-state within the [[North German Confederation]] (1866&amp;ndash;71), the [[German Empire]] (1871&amp;ndash;1918) and during the period of the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919&amp;ndash;33). Hamburg experienced its fastest growth during the second half of the 19th century, when its population more than quadrupled to 800,000 as the growth of the city's [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] trade helped make it Europe's third-largest port. With [[Albert Ballin]] as its director, the [[Hamburg America Line|Hamburg-America Line]] became the world's largest [[Atlantic Ocean|transatlantic]] shipping company at the turn of the century. Shipping companies sailing to [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[India]] and [[East Asia]] were based in the city. Hamburg was the departure port for most Germans and [[Eastern Europe]]ans to emigrate to the [[United States]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Trading communities from all over the world established themselves here.

A major outbreak of [[cholera]] in 1892 was badly handled by the city government, which still retained an unusual degree of independence for a German city at the time. About 8,600 died in the largest German epidemic of the late 19th century, and the last major cholera epidemic in a major city of the Western world.

===Second World War===
[[File:Hamburg after the 1943 bombing.jpg|thumb|[[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|Hamburg after the 1943 bombing]]]]
In the [[Third Reich]], Hamburg was a ''[[Administrative division of Nazi Germany|Gau]]'' from 1934 until 1945. During [[World War II]] Hamburg suffered a series of Allied [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|air raids]],
which devastated much of the inhabited city as well as harbour areas. On 23 July 1943 a [[firestorm]] developed as a result of Allied firebombing and, spreading from the ''Hauptbahnhof'' (central station) and quickly moving south-east, completely destroyed entire boroughs, such as [[Hammerbrook]], [[Billbrook]] or [[Hamm-south]]. These densely populated working-class boroughs underwent a dramatic demographic change as a result as thousands of people perished in the flames.
While some of the destroyed boroughs have been rebuilt as residential areas after the war,
others such as Hammerbrook are nowadays purely commercial areas with almost no residential population.
The raids, codenamed [[Operation Gomorrah]] by the [[RAF]], killed about 40,000 civilians; the precise number is not known.
About 1 million civilians were evacuated in the aftermath of the raids.

At least 42,900 people are thought to have perished &lt;ref name=&quot;kz-neuengamme&quot;&gt;[http://www.kz-gedenkstaette-neuengamme.de Gedenkstätte Konzentrationslager Neuengamme]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Neuengamme concentration camp|Neuengamme]] [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] (situated about {{convert|25|km|0|abbr=on}} outside the city in the marshlands), mostly due to epidemics and in the [[SS Cap Arcona (1927)|bombing of evacuation vessels]] at the end of the war.

===Postwar history===
Hamburg surrendered without a fight to [[British Armed Forces|British Forces]] on 3 May 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Ortwin Pelc, Kriegsende in Hamburg, Hamburg 2005&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]], Hamburg was in the [[Allied-occupied Germany|British Zone of Occupation]] and became a state of the then [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] in 1949. On 16 February 1962, the [[North Sea flood of 1962|North Sea flood of that year]] caused the Elbe to rise to an all-time high, inundating one-fifth of Hamburg and killing more than 300 people. In 1961, [[the Beatles]] became famous by playing music in clubs in Hamburg.

The [[Inner German Border]] — only {{convert|50|km|mi|-1}} east of Hamburg — separated the city from most of its hinterland and further reduced Hamburg's global trade. After [[German reunification]] in 1990, and the accession of some [[Eastern Europe]]an and [[Baltic states|Baltic States]] into the [[European Union|EU]] in 2004, the [[Port of Hamburg]] has ambitions for regaining its position as the region's largest deep-sea port for container shipping and its major commercial and trading centre.

There were 856,132 men and 898,050 women in Hamburg. For every 1,000 males there were 1,049 females. In 2006 there were 16,089 births in Hamburg (of which 33.1% were to unmarried women), 6,921 marriages and 4,583 divorces. In the city, the population was spread out with 15.7% under the age of 18, and 18.8% were 65 years of age or older.&lt;ref name=&quot;fact2006buch&quot;/&gt;

Recent estimates put the number of people with a migrant background at 28% (487.000).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.statistik-nord.de/uploads/tx_standocuments/SI_SPEZIAL_V_2010_01.pdf |title=|publisher=|date=|accessdate=2011-06-01|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; European immigrants constitute 70% of the migrant population, while Africans and south Asians make up 6% and 19%, respectively.&lt;ref name=immigration/&gt; Immigrants come from 180 different countries, including [[Turkish people|Turkey]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Iran]] or [[Ghana]].

==Government==
{{See|Government of Hamburg|List of mayors of Hamburg}}

[[File:Hamburg town hall tower.JPG|thumb|upright|Hamburg City Hall (front view)]]
The city of Hamburg is one of 16 [[States of Germany|German states]], therefore the [[Government of Hamburg|Mayor of Hamburg]]'s office corresponds more to the role of a [[Minister-President|minister-president]] than to the one of a city mayor. As a [[States of Germany#Politics|German state government]], it is responsible for public education, correctional institutions and public safety; as a municipality, it is additionally responsible for libraries, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply and welfare services.

Since 1897, the seat of the government has been the [[Hamburg Rathaus]], with the office of the mayor, the meeting room for the Senate and the floor for the [[Hamburg Parliament]].&lt;ref name=rathaus&gt;{{Citation |title=Kleiner Rathausführer |location=Hamburg |publisher=[[Government of Hamburg#Ministries|State Chancellery]] |year=2006}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2001 until 2010, the mayor of Hamburg was [[Ole von Beust]],&lt;ref name=usatoday2008&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-02-24-Germany-elections_N.htm |title=German conservatives win most votes |accessdate=2008-08-13 |publisher=USA today |date=2008-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; who governed in Germany's first state-wide &quot;black-green&quot; coalition, consisting of the conservative [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] and the alternative GAL, which are Hamburg's regional wing of the [[Alliance '90/The Greens]] party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kopp |first=Martin |title=Geheime Absprachen zwischen CDU und Grünen |year=2007 |location=Hamburg |publisher=[[Die Welt]] |url=http://www.welt.de/hamburg/arti2318261/Geheime_Absprachen_zwischen_CDU_und_Gruenen.html |date=2008-08-12|accessdate=2008-08-13 |postscript=.}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Beust was briefly succeeded by [[Christoph Ahlhaus]] in 2010 but the coalition broke apart on November, 28. 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2010-11/cdu-gruene-hamburg Schwarz-Grün in Hamburg am Ende] in [[Die Zeit]] - online, revisited on November, 28. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 March 2011 [[Olaf Scholz]] (SPD) became mayor.

===Boroughs===
{{Main|Boroughs and quarters of Hamburg}}
[[File:Hamburg Subdivisions.svg|thumb|left|250px|Boroughs of Hamburg]]
[[File:Germany (2), Neuwerk, Scharhörn, Nigehörn.jpg|thumb|220px|The part of the North Sea in this aerial picture is called the [[Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park]] and belongs administratively to the borough of [[Hamburg-Mitte]]. Some 39 people live here on the island [[Neuwerk]] (visible just above the centre).]]

Hamburg is made up of 7 boroughs (German: ''Bezirke'') and subdivided into 105 quarters (German: ''Stadtteile''). There are also 180 localities (German: ''Ortsteile''). The urban organization is regulated by the Constitution of Hamburg and several laws.&lt;ref name=constitution/&gt;&lt;ref name=borough&gt;Borough Administration Act {{Citation |title=Bezirksverwaltungsgesetz (BezVG)

The last large annexation was done through the [[Greater Hamburg Act]] of 1937, when the cities [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]], [[Harburg, Hamburg|Harburg]] and [[Hamburg-Wandsbek|Wandsbek]] were merged into the state of Hamburg.&lt;ref name=greateract&gt;[[Greater Hamburg Act]] {{Citation |title=Groß-Hamburg-Gesetz |url=http://www.verfassungen.de/de/hh/hamburg37.htm |date=1937-01-26 |accessdate=2008-09-24}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Act of the Constitution and Administration of Hanseatic city of Hamburg'' established Hamburg as a state and a municipality.&lt;ref name=reichconst&gt;Reich Act of the Constitution and Administration of Hanseatic city of Hamburg {{Citation |title=Reichsgesetz über die Verfassung und Verwaltung der Hansestadt Hamburg |url=http://www.verfassungen.de/de/hh/hamburg37-1.htm |date=1937-12-09 |accessdate=2008-09-24}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the boroughs and quarters have been rearranged several times over the years.

Each borough is governed by a Borough Council (German: ''Bezirksversammlung'') and administered by a Municipal Administrator (German: ''Bezirksamtsleiter''). The boroughs of Hamburg are not independent municipalities. The power of borough governments is limited and subordinate to the [[Mayor of Hamburg|Senate of Hamburg]]. The borough administrator is elected by the Borough Council and thereafter requires confirmation and appointment by Hamburgs' Senate.&lt;ref name=borough/&gt; The quarters have no governing bodies of their own.

In 2008 the boroughs of Hamburg were Altona, Bergedorf, Eimsbüttel, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord, Harburg and Wandsbek.&lt;ref name=actareal&gt;Hamburg Act of Areal Organization {{Citation |title=Gesetz über die räumliche Gliederung der Freien und Hansestadt Hamburg (RäumGiG) |date=2006-07-06 |url=http://hh.juris.de/hh/gesamt/RGlG_HA.htm |accessdate=2008-09-24}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]]'' is the westernmost urban borough on the right bank of the Elbe river. From 1640 to 1864 Altona was under the administration of the Danish monarchy. Altona was an independent city until 1937. Politically, the following quarters are part of Altona: Altona-Altstadt, [[Altona-Nord]], [[Bahrenfeld]], [[Ottensen]], [[Othmarschen]], Groß Flottbek, [[Osdorf, Hamburg|Osdorf]], [[Lurup]], [[Nienstedten]], [[Blankenese]], [[Iserbrook]], [[Sülldorf]], [[Rissen]], Sternschanze.&lt;ref name=actareal/&gt;

''[[Bergedorf]]'' consists of the quarters [[Allermöhe]], [[Altengamme]], [[Bergedorf (quarter)|Bergedorf]]&amp;mdash;the centre of the former independent town, Billwerder, Curslack, Kirchwerder, [[Lohbrügge]], Moorfleet, [[Neuengamme]], Ochsenwerder, Reitbrook, Spadenland and Tatenberg.&lt;ref name=actareal/&gt;

''[[Eimsbüttel]]'' is split into nine quarters: Eidelstedt, [[Eimsbüttel (quarter)|Eimsbüttel]], Harvestehude, Hoheluft-West, Lokstedt, [[Niendorf, Hamburg|Niendorf]], [[Rotherbaum]], Schnelsen and Stellingen.&lt;ref name=actareal/&gt; Located within this borough is former Jewish neighbourhood Grindel.

''[[Hamburg-Mitte]]'' (&quot;Hamburg Centre&quot;) covers mostly the urban centre of the city of Hamburg and consists of the quarters Billbrook, Billstedt, Borgfelde, [[Finkenwerder]], [[HafenCity]], Hamm-Nord, Hamm-Mitte, Hamm-Süd, [[Hammerbrook]], [[Horn, Hamburg|Horn]], [[Kleiner Grasbrook]], [[Neuwerk]], [[Rothenburgsort]], [[St. Georg, Hamburg|St. Georg]], [[St. Pauli]], Steinwerder, [[Veddel]], Waltershof and [[Wilhelmsburg, Hamburg|Wilhelmsburg]].&lt;ref name=actareal/&gt; The quarters Hamburg-Altstadt (&quot;old town&quot;) and Neustadt (&quot;new town&quot;) are the historical origin of Hamburg.

''[[Hamburg-Nord]]'' contains the quarters [[Alsterdorf]], Barmbek-Nord, Barmbek-Süd, Dulsberg, Eppendorf, [[Fuhlsbüttel]], Groß Borstel, Hoheluft-Ost, Hohenfelde, [[Langenhorn, Hamburg|Langenhorn]], Ohlsdorf, Uhlenhorst and [[Winterhude]].&lt;ref name=actareal/&gt;

''[[Harburg, Hamburg|Harburg]]'' lies on the southern shores of the river Elbe and covers parts of the port of Hamburg, residential and rural areas, and some research institutes. The quarters are [[Altenwerder]], [[Cranz, Hamburg|Cranz]], Eißendorf, Francop, Gut Moor, [[Harburg (quarter)|Harburg]], Hausbruch, Heimfeld, Langenbek, Marmstorf, Moorburg, [[Neuenfelde]], [[Neugraben-Fischbek]], Neuland, Rönneburg, Sinstorf and Wilstorf.&lt;ref name=actareal/&gt;

Hamburg has architecturally significant buildings in a wide range of styles. There are, however, only few [[skyscraper]]s. On the other hand, churches like [[St. Nikolai, Hamburg|St. Nicholas's church]], the world's tallest building in the 19th century, are important landmarks. The skyline of Hamburg features the high spires of the principal churches (''Hauptkirchen'') [[St. Michaelis Church, Hamburg|St. Michael's Church]] (nicknamed “Michel&quot;), [[St. Peter's Church, Hamburg|St. Peter's Church]], [[St. Jacobi, Hamburg|St. James's]] (''St. Jacobi'') and [[St. Catherine's Church, Hamburg|St. Catherine's Church]] covered with copper plates, and of course the [[Heinrich-Hertz-Turm]], the once publicly accessible radio and television tower.

The many streams, rivers and canals in Hamburg are crossed by over 2300 bridges, more than [[Amsterdam]] or [[Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Hamburg &amp;ndash; Grüne Metropole am Wasser |url=http://www.hamburg.de/umwelt/wasser/150782/stadt-am-wasser.html |date=2007-07-01 |author=Staff |publisher=[[Government of Hamburg#Ministries|Behörde für Stadtentwicklung und Umwelt]] |location=Hamburg |accessdate=2008-09-24}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamburg has more bridges inside its city limits than any other city in the world. The [[Köhlbrandbrücke]], [[Freihafen Elbbrücken]], and Lombardsbrücke and Kennedybrücke dividing Binnenalster from Aussenalster are important roadways.

The [[Hamburg Rathaus|town hall]] is a richly decorated Neo-Renaissance building finished in 1897.
The tower is {{convert|112|m|0}} high.

Europe's largest inner-city development (as of 2008), the [[HafenCity]], will house about 10,000 inhabitants and 15,000 workers. The plan includes designs by [[Rem Koolhaas]] and [[Renzo Piano]]. The [[Elbe Philharmonic Hall]] ''(Elbphilharmonie)'', expected to be completed by mid-2012, will house concerts in a building on top of an old warehouse, designed by the Swiss firm ''[[Herzog &amp; de Meuron]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Staff |title=River Tunes: Elbe Philharmonic Hall by Herzog &amp; de Meuron |url=http://www.archnewsnow.com/features/Feature223.htm |date=2007-04-05 |accessdate=2008-08-23 |publisher=ArchNewsNow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Jaeger |first=Falk |title=Waterfront Living and Working: Hamburg's HafenCity |url=http://www.goethe.de/kue/arc/dos/dos/sls/en3356905.htm |publisher=[[Goethe-Institut]] |month=May |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-08-23 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080602083717/http://www.goethe.de/kue/arc/dos/dos/sls/en3356905.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate= 2008-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The many parks of Hamburg are distributed over the whole city, which makes Hamburg a very verdant city. The biggest parks are the ''Stadtpark'', the [[Ohlsdorf Cemetery]] and [[Planten un Blomen]]. The ''Stadtpark'', Hamburg's &quot;Central Park&quot;, has a great lawn and a huge water tower, which houses one of Europe's biggest [[planetarium|planetaria]]. The park and its buildings were designed by [[Fritz Schumacher (architect)|Fritz Schumacher]] in the 1910s.

===Parks and gardens===
The ''[[Alter Botanischer Garten Hamburg]]'' is a historic [[botanical garden]], located in the ''[[Planten un Blomen]]'' park, which now consists primarily of [[greenhouse]]s. The ''[[Botanischer Garten Hamburg]]'' is a modern [[botanical garden]] maintained by the [[University of Hamburg]].

==Culture and contemporary life==
Hamburg offers more than 40 theatres, 60 museums and 100 music venues and clubs. In 2005, more than 18 million people visited concerts, exhibitions, theatres, cinemas, museums, and cultural events. More than 8,552 taxable companies &amp;ndash; the average size was 3.16 employees &amp;ndash; were engaged in the culture sector, which includes music, performing arts and literature.

===Theatres===
[[File:Hamburg Deutsches Schauspielhaus 01 KMJ.jpg|thumb|''Deutsches Schauspielhaus'' in the quarter St. Georg.]]
[[File:Hh-hammoniabad.jpg|thumb|The ''English Theatre'']]

The state-owned ''[[Deutsches Schauspielhaus]]'', the [[Thalia Theatre (Hamburg)|Thalia Theatre]], &quot;Ohnsorg Theatre&quot;, &quot;Schmidts Tivoli&quot; and the ''Kampnagel'' are well-known theatres in Germany and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Kulturstiftung des Bundes |url=http://www.kulturstiftung-des-bundes.de/main.jsp?applicationID=203&amp;languageID=2&amp;articleID=3076 |title=Bayreuth Was Yesterday &amp;ndash; New Opera at Kampnagel |accessdate=2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The English Theatre of Hamburg]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.englishtheatre.de/ ''The English Theatre'' of Hamburg]&lt;/ref&gt; near U3 Mundsburg station was established in 1976 and is the oldest professional English-speaking theatre in Germany, and has exclusively English native-speaking actors in its company.

===Museums===
Hamburg possesses several big museums and galleries showing classical and contemporary art, as for example the [[Kunsthalle Hamburg]] with its contemporary art gallery (''Galerie der Gegenwart''), the Museum for Art and Industry (''[[Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg|Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe]]'') and the [[Deichtorhallen]]/House of Photography. The [[Internationales Maritimes Museum Hamburg]] opened in the HafenCity quarter in 2008. There are various specialised museums in Hamburg, such as the Museum of Labour (''Museum der Arbeit''), and several museums of local history, for example the Kiekeberg Open Air Museum (''Freilichtmuseum am [[Kiekeberg]]''). Two ''museum ships'' near Landungsbrücken bear witness to the freight ship (''[[Cap San Diego]]'') and cargo sailing ship era (''[[Rickmer Rickmers]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museen-in-hamburg.de/ |title=Museums in Hamburg |accessdate=December 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world's largest model railway museum [[Miniatur Wunderland]] with {{convert|12|km|2|abbr=on}} total railway length is also situated near Landungsbrücken in a former warehouse.

''BallinStadt Emigration City'' is dedicated to the millions of Europeans who emigrated from its mass accommodation halls to North and South America between 1850 and 1939. Visitors descending from those overseas emigrants may search for their ancestors at computer terminals.

===Music===
[[Hamburg State Opera]] is a leading opera company. Its orchestra is the [[Philharmoniker Hamburg]]. The city's other well-known orchestra is the [[North German Radio Symphony Orchestra]]. The main concert venue is the [[Laeiszhalle]], ''Musikhalle Hamburg'', pending completion of the new [[Elbe Philharmonic Hall]]. The Laeiszhalle also houses a third orchestra, the [[Hamburger Symphoniker]]. [[György Ligeti]] and [[Alfred Schnittke]] taught at the [[Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Transcript of the John Tusa Interview with Gyorgy Ligeti |author=Staff |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/johntusainterview/ligeti_transcript.shtml |year=1999 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2008-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Alfred Schnittke |author=Staff |url=http://www.boosey.com/pages/cr/composer/composer_main.asp?composerid=2731&amp;ttype=BIOGRAPHY&amp;ttitle=Biography/ |publisher=[[Boosey &amp; Hawkes]] |accessdate=2008-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the German premiere of ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' in 1985, there have always been [[musical theatre|musicals]] running in the city, including ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]'', ''[[Dirty Dancing#Stage version|Dirty Dancing]]'', and ''[[Dance of the Vampires]]''. This density, the highest in Germany, is partly due to the major musical production company ''[[Stage Entertainment]]'' being based in the city.

Hamburg is the birthplace of [[Johannes Brahms]], who spent his formative early years in the city. Hamburg was also the birthplace and home for famous waltz composer [[Oscar Fetrás]] who wrote the well-known &quot;Mondnacht auf der Alster&quot; waltz.

Prior to the group's initial recording and subsequent widespread fame, Hamburg provided residency and performing venues for [[The Beatles in Hamburg|The Beatles]] from 1960 to 1962. Hamburg has produced a number of pop musicians. Identical twin brothers [[Bill Kaulitz]] and Tom Kaulitz from the rock band [[Tokio Hotel]] live and maintain a recording studio in Hamburg, where they recorded their second and third albums, [[Zimmer 483]] and [[Humanoid]]. Singer [[Nena]] also lives in Hamburg. There are German hip hop acts, such as [[Fünf Sterne deluxe]], [[Samy Deluxe]], Beginner and [[Fettes Brot]]. There is a substantial [[alternative rock|alternative]] and [[punk rock|punk]] scene, which gathers around the [[Rote Flora]], a [[squatting|squatted]] former theatre located in the Sternschanze. Hamburg is famous for an original kind of German [[alternative rock|alternative music]] called ''[[Hamburger Schule]]'' (&quot;Hamburg School&quot;), a term used for bands like [[Tocotronic]], [[Blumfeld]], [[Tomte (band)|Tomte]] or [[Kante (band)|Kante]].

The city was a major centre for [[heavy metal music]] in the 1980s. [[Helloween]], [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]], [[Running Wild (band)|Running Wild]] and [[Grave Digger (band)|Grave Digger]] started in Hamburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=allmusic (((Helloween&gt; Biography ))) |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4471|pure_url=yes}} |first=Eduardo |last=Rivadavia |publisher=allmusic |accessdate=2008-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[industrial rock]] band [[KMFDM]] was also formed in Hamburg, initially as a performance art project. The influences of these and other bands from the area helped establish the subgenre of [[power metal]].

Hamburg has a vibrant psychedelic trance community, with record labels such as [[Spirit Zone Records|Spirit Zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Spirit Zone Recordings |author=Staff |url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Spirit+Zone+Recordings |publisher=www.discogs.com |accessdate=2008-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Festivals and regular events===
[[File:Hamburger Hafengeburtstag.jpg|thumb|left|annual [[Port of Hamburg]]-birthday]]
Hamburg is noted for several festivals and regular events. Some of them are street festivals, such as the [[gay pride]] ''[[Christopher Street Day]]'' festival&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Christopher Street day Hamburg |url=http://www.hamburg-pride.de/ |accessdate=2008-10-05}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Alster fair,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alstervergnügen Hamburg |url=http://www.alstervergnuegen.net/ |accessdate=2008-10-05}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; held at the ''[[Binnenalster]]''.

===Cuisine===
[[File:Scholle mit Speck.jpg|thumb|fried plaice [[Finkenwerder]] style]]
Original Hamburg dishes are ''[[Birnen, Bohnen und Speck]]'' ([[Northern Low Saxon dialect|Low Saxon]] ''Birn, Bohn un Speck'', green beans cooked with pears and bacon),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/07/05/43504.html |title=Birnen, Bohnen, Speck &amp;ndash; Schmeckt vorzüglich |date=2002-07-05 |accessdate=2008-08-11}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aalsuppe'' (Low Saxon ''Oolsupp'') is often mistaken to be German for “eel soup“ (''Aal''/''Ool'' translated ‘eel’), but the name probably comes from the Low Saxon ''allns'' {{IPA|[aˑlns]}}, meaning “all”, “everything and the kitchen sink”, not necessarily eel. Today eel is often included to meet the expectations of unsuspecting diners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/06/25/39651.html |title=Aalsuppe &amp;ndash; Frage des Geschmacks |date=2002-06-25|accessdate=2008-08-11}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is ''Bratkartoffeln'' (Low Saxon ''Brootkartüffeln'', pan-fried potato slices), ''Finkenwerder Scholle'' (Low Saxon ''Finkwarder Scholl'', pan-fried plaice), ''Pannfisch'' (pan-fried fish),&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/06/25/39713.html |title=Maischollen &amp;ndash; Zart gebraten |date=2002-06-25 |accessdate=2008-08-11}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rødgrød|Rote Grütze]]'' (Low Saxon ''Rode Grütt'', related to Danish ''rødgrød'', a type of summer pudding made mostly from berries and usually served with cream, like Danish ''rødgrød med fløde'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendbla |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/06/25/39656.html |title=Grütze &amp;ndash; Mit kalter Milch |date=2002-06-25 |accessdate=2008-08-11}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Labskaus]]'' (a mixture of corned beef, mashed potatoes and beetroot, a cousin of the Norwegian ''lapskaus'' and [[Liverpool]]'s [[Scouse (food)|lobscouse]], all offshoots off an old-time one-pot meal that used to be the main component of the common sailor's humdrum diet on the high seas).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/06/25/39664.html |title=Labskaus &amp;ndash; Essen der Matrosen |date=2002-06-25 |accessdate=2008-08-11}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Alsterwasser'' (a reference to the city's river Alster with its two lakes in the city centre created by impoundment) is the local name for a type of [[shandy]], a concoction of equal parts of beer and carbonated lemonade (''Zitronenlimonade''), the lemonade being added to the beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/08/01/52867.html |title=Alsterwasser &amp;ndash; Bier und Limonade |date=2002-08-10 |accessdate=2008-08-11}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is the curious regional dessert pastry called [[Franzbrötchen]]. Looking rather like a flattened croissant, the ''Franzbrötchen'' is somewhat similar in preparation but includes a cinnamon and sugar filling, often with raisins or brown sugar [[streusel]]. The name may also reflect to the roll's [[croissant]]-like appearance &amp;ndash; ''franz'' appears to be a shortening of ''französisch'', meaning &quot;French&quot;, which would make a ''Franzbrötchen'' a “French roll.”
Ordinary bread rolls tend to be oval-shaped and of the French bread variety. The local name is ''Rundstück'' (“round piece” rather than mainstream German ''Brötchen'', diminutive form of ''Brot'' “bread”),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/08/05/53895.html |title=Rundstück &amp;ndash; Hamburger Brötchen |date=2002-08-05 |accessdate=2008-06-06}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; a relative of Denmark's ''rundstykke''. In fact, while by no means identical, the cuisines of Hamburg and Denmark, especially of Copenhagen have a lot in common. This also includes a predilection for open-faced sandwiches of all sorts, especially topped with cold-smoked or pickled fish. The American [[hamburger]] seems to have developed from Hamburg's ''Frikadelle'': a pan-fried patty (usually larger and thicker than its American counterpart) made from a mixture of ground beef, soaked [[staling|stale bread]], egg, chopped onion, salt and pepper, usually served with potatoes and vegetables like any other piece of meat, not usually on a bun.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The Oxford Dictionary defined a ''Hamburger steak'' in 1802: a sometimes-smoked and -salted piece of meat, that, according to some sources, came from Hamburg to America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Stradley |first=Linda |title=History of Hamburgers |url=http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/HamburgerHistory.htm |year=2004 |accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
As is typical for Northern Germany, the original language of Hamburg is [[Low German]], usually referred to as ''Hamborger Platt'' (German ''Hamburger Platt'') or ''[[Hamburgisch|Hamborgsch]]''. Since large-scale Germanization beginning in earnest within the 18th century, various Low German-colored dialects have developed (contact-varieties of German on Low Saxon substrates). Originally, there was a range of such [[Missingsch]] varieties, the best-known being the low-prestige ones of the working classes and the somewhat more bourgeois ''Hanseatendeutsch'' (Hanseatic German), although the term is used in appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |contribution=Die deutsche Sprache—eine Dialektlandschaft |title=Nationalatlas Bundesrepublik Deutschland |last=Bausch |first=Karl-Heinz |contribution-url=http://www.ifl-nationalatlas.de/download/bsppdf/Band_6_bsp.pdf |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-09-24 |publisher=Leibniz-Institut für Länderkunde |location=Leipzig |isbn=3827409470 |pages=94–95}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these are now moribund due to the influences of Standard German used by education and media. However, the former importance of Low German is indicated by several songs, such as the famous [[sea shanty]] [[Hamborger Veermaster]], written in the 19th century when Low German was used more frequently.

Tourists play a significant role in the city's economy. In 2007, Hamburg attracted more than 3,985,105&amp;nbsp;visitors with 7,402,423&amp;nbsp;overnight stays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=[http://www.hamburg-tourism.de/ Hamburg Tourismus GmbH] |url=http://www.hamburg-tourism.de/fileadmin/files/B2B/Zahlen_und_Fakten/Tourismusmonitor/Newsletter/Newsletter_Nr18.pdf |format=PDF|title=Newsletter Nr. 18 |date=2008-02-29 |accessdate=2008-08-13}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tourism sector employs more than 175,000 people full-time and brings in [[revenue]] of €9.3 billion, making the tourism industry a major economic force in the Hamburg Metropolitan Region. Hamburg has one of the fastest-growing tourism industries in Germany. From 2001 to 2007, the overnight stays in the city increased by 55.2% (Berlin +52.7%, [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania]] +33%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher=[[Politics of Hamburg#Ministries|Behörde für Kultur, Sport und Medien]] |url=http://www.hamburg.de/daten-fakten/349180/aktuelles.html |title=Umsatzbringer und Jobmotor Tourismus |author=Staff |date=2008-07-11 |accessdate=2008-08-13}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical Hamburg visit includes a tour of the city hall and the grand church [[St. Michaelis Church, Hamburg|St. Michaelis]] (called the ''Michel''), and visiting the old warehouse district (''[[Speicherstadt]]'') and the [[Landungsbrücken|harbour promenade]] (''Landungsbrücken''). Sightseeing buses connect these points of interest. As Hamburg is one of the world's largest harbours many visitors take one of the harbour and/or canal boat tours (''Große Hafenrundfahrt'', ''Fleetfahrt'') which start from the ''Landungsbrücken''. Major destinations also include [[museum]]s.

Many visitors take a walk in the evening around the area of [[Reeperbahn]] in the quarter [[St. Pauli]], Europe's largest red light district{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} and home of strip clubs, brothels, bars and nightclubs. The singer and actor [[Hans Albers]] is strongly associated with St. Pauli, and wrote the neighbourhood's unofficial anthem, &quot;Auf der Reeperbahn Nachts um Halb Eins&quot; (&quot;On the Reeperbahn Half Past Midnight&quot;) in the 1940s. [[The Beatles]] had stints on the Reeperbahn early in their careers. Others prefer the laid-back neighbourhood ''Schanze'' with its street cafés, or a barbecue on one of the beaches along the river Elbe. Hamburg's famous zoo, the [[Tierpark Hagenbeck]], was founded in 1907 by [[Carl Hagenbeck]] as the first zoo with moated, barless enclosures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |publisher=[[National Audubon Society]] |work=Audubon Magazine |title=The New Zoo |url=http://audubonmagazine.org/features0111/newzoo.html |author=Rene S. Ebersole |month=November |year=2001 |accessdate=2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some visit Hamburg out of a specific interest, notably one of the musicals, a sports event, a trade show or convention. In 2005, the average visitor spent two nights in Hamburg.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The majority of visitors come from Germany. Most foreigners are European, especially from the [[United Kingdom]] (171,000 overnight stays), [[Switzerland]] (about 143,000 overnight stays) and [[Austria]] (about 137,000 overnight stays). The largest group from outside Europe comes from the [[United States]] (129,000 overnight stays).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Zahlen,Fakten,Trends 2007 |url=http://www.hamburg-tourism.de/fileadmin/files/B2B/Zahlen_und_Fakten/Studien_Publikationen/Zahlen-Fakten-Trends_2007.pdf |format=PDF |year=2008 |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburg Tourismus GmbH |accessdate=2008-09-24}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Gaßdorf: Engländer wollen in den Hafen, Amerikaner in gute Restaurants.

The cruise terminal is also a draw. The [[RMS Queen Mary 2|Queen Mary 2]] has docked in Hamburg regularly since 2004, and there are six departures planned from 2010 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;''Hamburg wird heimlicher Heimathafen der &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot; (in English: Hamburg nearly a home port for &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot;).''

Hamburg is a major transportation hub in Germany. Hamburg is connected to four [[Autobahn]]en (motorways) and is the most important railway junction on the route to Scandinavia.

Bridges and tunnels connect the northern and southern parts of the city, such as the [[Elbe Tunnel (1911)|old Elbe Tunnel]] (''Alter Elbtunnel'') now a major tourist sight, and the [[Elbe Tunnel (1975)|Elbe Tunnel]] (''Elbtunnel'') the crossing of a [[Bundesautobahn 7|motorway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/09/10/67509.html |title=Elbe ohne e &amp;ndash; Buchstaben fallen weg |date=2002-08-10 |accessdate=2008-08-11}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some airlines market [[Lübeck Airport]] in [[Lübeck]] as serving Hamburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Hamburg Lübeck Airport Guide |url=http://www.travel-library.com/airports/europe/Germany/hamburg/hamburg_lubeck_airport.html |author=Staff |publisher=www.travel-library.com |accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamburg's [[Vehicle registration plates of Germany|license plate]] prefix has been and is again &quot;HH&quot; (Hansestadt Hamburg, English: Hanseatic city of Hamburg) between 1906 and 1945 and again since 1956, rather than just the single-letter normally used for large cities since the federal registration reform in 1956, such as B for Berlin or M for Munich. The prefix &quot;H&quot; is used instead by [[Hanover]] since 1956. However, &quot;H&quot; was Hamburg's prefix in the years between 1945–1947.&lt;ref&gt;Other prefixes used between 1945 and 1956 were &quot;MGH&quot; (Military Government, Hamburg; 1945 only), &quot;HG&quot; (1947 only) and &quot;BH&quot; (British Zone, Hamburg) between 1948 and 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public transportation====
[[Public transport]] by rail, bus and ships is organized by a fare-collection joint venture between transportation companies. Tickets sold by one company in this ''[[Hamburger Verkehrsverbund]]'' (&quot;Hamburg transit authority&quot;) (HVV) are valid on all other HVV companies' services. The HVV was the first organization of this kind worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=HVV &amp;ndash; Mehr als ein Ziel &amp;ndash; Historie |url=http://www.hvv.de/ueber-uns/historie/ |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Verkehrsverbund |accessdate=2008-09-25}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Rail
Nine mass transit rail lines across the city are the backbone of Hamburg public transportation. The [[Hamburg S-Bahn]] (heavy railway system) system comprises six lines and the [[Hamburg U-Bahn]] three lines. ''U-Bahn'' is short for ''Untergrundbahn'' (underground railway). Approximately {{convert|41|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of {{convert|101|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of the subway is underground; most of the tracks are on embankments, viaducts or at ground level. Older residents still speak of the system as ''Hochbahn'' (elevated railway), also because the operating company of the subway is the ''[[Hamburger Hochbahn]]''. Another heavy railway system, the [[AKN Eisenbahn|AKN railway]], connects satellite towns in Schleswig-Holstein to the city. On certain routes, regional trains of Germany's major railway company [[Deutsche Bahn|Deutsche Bahn AG]] and the regional ''[[metronom Eisenbahngesellschaft|metronom]]'' trains may be used with a HVV public transport ticket, too. Except at the three bigger stations in the centre of Hamburg, such as [[Hamburg Hauptbahnhof|Hamburg central station]], [[Hamburg Dammtor station]], or [[Hamburg-Altona station]], the regional trains hardly stop inside the area of the city. The [[tram]] network was shut down in 1978.

;Bus
Gaps in the rail network are filled by more than 600 bus routes, plied by single-deck, two-, three- and four-axle diesel buses. Hamburg has no trams or trolley-buses, but has hydrogen-fueled buses operating pilot services. The buses run frequently during working hours, with some buses on some routes arriving as often as every 2 minutes. In suburban areas and on special weekday night lines the intervals can be 30 minutes or longer.

;Ferries
There are six ferry lines along the river Elbe, operated by the ''[[HADAG Seetouristik und Fährdienst|HADAG]]'' company. While mainly used by Hamburg citizens and dock workers, they can also be used for sightseeing tours.

;Aviation
The international airport at Hamburg Fuhlsbüttel, official name &quot;[[Hamburg Airport]]&quot; ([[International Air Transport Association|IATA]]: HAM, [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]]: EDDH) is the fifth biggest airport in Germany and the oldest airport in Germany, having been established in 1912. It is about 5 miles from the city centre. About 60 airlines provide service to 125 destination airports, including some long distance destinations like New York, Dubai, Toronto and Tehran. [[Lufthansa]] is the hub carrier, with the most flights, followed by [[Air Berlin]]. [[Lufthansa]] operates one of its biggest [[Lufthansa Technik|maintenance facilities]] at the Hamburg airport.

The second airport in Hamburg is Hamburg-Finkenwerder ([[International Air Transport Association|IATA]]: XFW, [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]]: EDHI). It is about 10&amp;nbsp;km from the city centre and is a nonpublic airport for the [[Airbus Operations GmbH|Airbus]] plant. It is the second biggest Airbus plant, after Toulouse, and the third biggest aviation manufacturing plant after Seattle and Toulouse. The Finkenwerder plant houses the final assembly lines for A318, A319, A321 and [[Airbus A380|A380]] aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Airbus in Germany |url=http://www.airbus.com/company/worldwide-presence/airbus-in-germany/ |author=Staff |publisher=Airbus |accessdate=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|In Hamburg it's hard to find a native Hamburger. A hurried and superficial search turns up only crayfish, people from Pinneberg, and those from Bergedorf. One accompanies the contented little kippers of a striving society; mackerels from Stade, sole from Finkenwerder, herrings from Cuxhaven swim in expectant throngs through the streets of my city and lobsters patrol the stock exchange with open claws.... The first so-called unguarded glance always lands on the bottom of the sea and falls into twilight of the aquarium. [[Heinrich Heine]] must have had the same experience when he tried, with his cultivated scorn and gifted melancholy, to find the people of Hamburg.|[[Siegfried Lenz]]||in ''Leute von Hamburg'' (People from Hamburg) ISBN 978-3-423-11538-4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Jennifer |last=Jenkins |title=Provincial modernity: local culture and liberal politics in fin-de-siècle Hamburg |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0801440254}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

}}
'''Helmut Josef Michael Kohl''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhɛlmuːt ˈkoːl}}; born 3 April 1930) is a [[Germans|German]] conservative politician and statesman. He was [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Chancellor of Germany]] from 1982 to 1998 (of West Germany between 1982 and 1990 and of the reunited Germany between 1990 and 1998) and the chairman of the [[Christian-Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) from 1973 to 1998. His 16-year tenure was the longest of any German chancellor since [[Otto von Bismarck]] and oversaw the end of the [[Cold War]] and the [[German reunification]]. Kohl is widely regarded as one of the main architects of the German reunification and, together with French President [[François Mitterrand]], the [[Maastricht Treaty]], which contributed to the creation of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chambers&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Mortimer | last=Chambers | title=The Western Experience }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kohl and Mitterrand were the joint recipients of the [[Karlspreis]] in 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;karlspreis&quot;/&gt; In 1998, Kohl was named [[Honorary Citizen of Europe]] by the [[European Council|European heads of state or government]] for his extraordinary work for European integration and cooperation, an honour previously only bestowed on [[Jean Monnet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eu-honorary&quot;/&gt; In 1996, he won the prestigious [[Prince of Asturias Award]] in International Cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundacionprincipedeasturias.org/ing/04/premiados/trayectorias/trayectoria667.html Helmut Kohl]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kohl has been described as &quot;the greatest European leader of the second half of the 20th century&quot; by former U.S. Presidents [[George H. W. Bush]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/europe/hero2006/kohl.html Time, ''Helmut Kohl'', by George H. W. Bush]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/europe/news/article_1639558.php/Clinton-praises-Germany-s-Kohl-at-Berlin-award M&amp;C news, &quot;Clinton praises Germany's Kohl at Berlin Award&quot;, by Deutsche Presse Agentur]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
===Youth===
Kohl was born in [[Ludwigshafen am Rhein]] (at the time part of [[Bavaria]], now in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]) [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], the third child of Cäcilie (''née'' Schnur; 1890–1979) and her husband Hans Kohl (1887–1975), a civil servant. His family was conservative and [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], and remained loyal to the [[Catholic Centre Party]] before and after 1933. His older brother died in the [[World War II|Second World War]] as a teenage soldier. In the last weeks of the war, Kohl was also drafted, but he was not involved in any combat.

Kohl attended the Ruprecht elementary school, and continued at the Max-Planck-Gymnasium. In 1946, he joined the recently founded [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]. In 1947, he was one of the co-founders of the [[Junge Union]]-branch in Ludwigshafen. After graduating in 1950, he began to study law in [[Frankfurt am Main]]. In 1951, he switched to the [[University of Heidelberg]] where he majored in [[History]] and [[Political Science]]. In 1953, he joined the board of the [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] branch of the CDU. In 1954, he became vice-chair of the Junge Union in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. In 1955, he returned to the board of the Rhineland-Palatinate branch of the CDU.

===Life before politics===
After graduating in 1956 he became fellow at the Alfred Weber Institute of the [[University of Heidelberg]] where he was an active member of the student society [[AIESEC]]. In 1958, he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate degree]] for his thesis &quot;The Political Developments in the Palatinate and the Reconstruction of Political Parties after 1945&quot;. After that, he entered business, first as an assistant to the director of a foundry in Ludwigshafen and, in 1959, as a manager for the Industrial Union for Chemistry in Ludwigshafen. In this year, he also became chair of the Ludwigshafen branch of the CDU. In the following year, he married [[Hannelore Kohl|Hannelore Renner]], whom he had known since 1948, and they had two sons.

=== Early political career===

In 1960, he was elected into the municipal council of Ludwigshafen where he served as leader of the CDU party until 1969. In 1963, he was also elected into the [[States of Germany|Landtag]] of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] and served as leader of the CDU party in that legislature. From 1966 until 1973, he served as the chair of the CDU, and he was also a member of the Federal CDU board. After his election as party-chair, he was named as the successor to Peter Altmeier, who was minister-president of Rhineland-Palatinate at the time. However, after the Landtag-election which followed, Altmeier remained minister-president.

===Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F028914-0002, Ludwigshafen, CDU-Kongress, Helmut Kohl.jpg|thumb|Helmut Kohl, 1969]]
On 19 May 1969, Kohl was elected minister-president of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], as the successor to [[Peter Altmeier]]. During his term as minister-president, Kohl founded the [[University of Kaiserslautern|University of Trier-Kaiserslautern]] and enacted territorial reform. Also in 1969, Kohl became the vice-chair of the federal CDU party.

In 1971, he was a candidate to become chairman of the federal CDU, but was not elected. Rainer Barzel remained in the position instead. In 1972, Barzel attempted to force a cabinet crisis in the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]/[[Freie Demokratische Partei|FDP]] government, which failed, leading him to step down. In 1973, Kohl succeeded him as federal chairman; he retained this position until 1998.

===The 1976 Bundestag election===

In the [[German federal election, 1976|1976 federal election]], Kohl was the CDU/CSU's candidate for chancellor.  The CDU/CSU coalition performed very well, winning 48.6% of the vote. However they were kept out of government by the centre-left cabinet formed by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] and [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)]], led by Social Democrat [[Helmut Schmidt]]. Kohl then retired as minister-president of Rhineland-Palatinate to become the leader of the CDU/CSU in the [[Bundestag]]. He was succeeded by Bernhard Vogel.

===Leader of the opposition===

In the [[German federal election, 1980|1980 federal elections]], Kohl had to play second fiddle, when CSU-leader [[Franz Josef Strauß]] became the CDU/CSU's candidate for chancellor. Strauß was also unable to defeat the SPD/FDP alliance. Unlike Kohl, Strauß did not want to continue as the leader of the CDU/CSU and remained Minister-President of [[Bavaria]]. Kohl remained as leader of the opposition, under the third Schmidt cabinet (1980&amp;ndash;82).

On 17 September 1982, a conflict of economic policy occurred between the governing SPD/FDP coalition partners. The FDP wanted to radically liberalise the labour market, while the SPD preferred to guarantee the employment of those who already had jobs. The FDP began talks with the CDU/CSU to form a new government.

==Chancellor of West Germany==
===Rise to power===
On 1 October 1982, the CDU proposed a [[constructive vote of no confidence]] which was supported by the FDP. The motion carried, and, on 4 October, the Bundestag voted in a [[Cabinet Kohl I|new CDU/CSU-FDP coalition cabinet]], with Kohl as the chancellor.  Many of the important details of the new coalition had been hammered out on 20 September, though minor details were reportedly still being hammered out as the vote took place.

Though Kohl's election was done according to the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]], some voices criticized the move as the FDP had fought its 1980 campaign on the side of the SPD and even placed Chancellor Schmidt on some of their campaign posters. Some voices went as far as denying that the new government had the support of a majority of the people. To answer this question, the new government aimed at new elections at the earliest possible date.

Since the Basic Law is restrictive on the dissolution of parliament, Kohl had to take another controversial move: he called for a confidence vote only a month after being sworn in, in which members of his coalition abstained. The ostensibly negative result for Kohl then allowed
[[President of Germany|President]] [[Karl Carstens]] to dissolve the Bundestag in January 1983.

The move was controversial as the coalition parties denied their votes to the same man they had elected Chancellor a month before and whom they wanted to re-elect after the parliamentary election. However, this step was condoned by the German [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] as a legal instrument and was again applied (by SPD Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] and his [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green]] allies) in 2005.

===The second cabinet===

In the [[German federal election, 1983|federal elections of March 1983]], Kohl won a smashing victory.  The CDU/CSU won 48.8%, while the FDP won 7.0%. Some opposition members of the Bundestag asked the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal constitutional court]] to declare the whole proceedings unconstitutional. It denied their claim.

The [[Cabinet Kohl II|second Kohl cabinet]] pushed through several controversial plans, including the stationing of [[NATO]] midrange missiles, against major opposition from the peace movement.

On 24 January 1984, Kohl spoke before the [[Israel]]i [[Knesset]], as the first Chancellor of the post-war generation. In his speech, he used Günter Gaus' famous sentence, that he had &quot;the mercy of a late birth&quot;.

On 22 September 1984 Kohl met the French president [[François Mitterrand]] at [[Verdun]], where the [[Battle of Verdun]] between France and Germany had taken place during
World War I. Together, they commemorated the deaths of both World Wars. The photograph, which depicted their minutes long handshake became an important symbol of French-German reconciliation. Kohl and Mitterrand developed a close political relationship, forming an important motor for [[European integration]]. Together, they laid the foundations for European projects, like [[Eurocorps]] and [[Arte]]. This French-German cooperation also was vital for important European projects, like the [[Treaty of Maastricht]] and the [[Euro]].

In 1985, Kohl and US President [[Ronald Reagan]], as part of a plan to observe the 40th anniversary of [[V-E Day]], saw an opportunity to demonstrate the strength of the friendship that existed between Germany and its former foe. During a November 1984 visit to the White House, Kohl appealed to Reagan to join him in symbolizing the reconciliation of their two countries at a German military cemetery. As Reagan visited Germany as part of the [[G8|G6]] conference in [[Bonn]], the pair visited [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] [[concentration camp]] on 5 May, and more controversially the German military cemetery in [[Bitburg]], discovered to hold 49 members of the [[Waffen-SS]] buried there.

In 1986, more controversy was caused by an essay published in the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' on 25 April 1986 entitled &quot;Land Without A History&quot; written by one of Kohl's advisors, the historian [[Michael Stürmer]], in which Stürmer argued that West Germany lacked a history to be proud of, and called for effort on the part of the government, historians and the media to build national pride in German history. Though Stürmer insisted that he was writing on behalf of himself and not in an official capacity as the Chancellor's advisor, many left-wing intellectuals claimed that Stürmer's essay also expressed Kohl's views.

===The third cabinet===
[[Image:ReaganBerlinWall.jpg|thumb|Chancellor Kohl behind and to the right of U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] (center) at the [[Brandenburg Gate]]. President Reagan, challenging [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] to &quot;[[tear down this wall]]!&quot; in 1987]]
After the [[German federal election, 1987|federal elections of 1987]] Kohl won a slightly reduced majority and formed his [[Cabinet Kohl III|third cabinet]].  The SPD's candidate for chancellor was the Minister-President of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Johannes Rau]].

In 1987, Kohl received [[East Germany|East German]] leader [[Erich Honecker]] - the first ever visit by an East German head of state to West Germany. This is generally seen as a sign that Kohl pursued ''[[Ostpolitik]]'', a policy of [[détente]] between East and West that had been begun by the SPD-led governments (and strongly opposed by Kohl's own CDU) during the 1970s. Following the breach of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989, Kohl's handling of the East German issue would become the turning point of his chancellorship.

===The road to reunification===
{{Main|German reunification}}
[[Image:Helmut Kohl in Krzyzowa.jpg|thumb|left|Helmut Kohl in [[Krzyżowa (Świdnica County)|Krzyżowa]] (Kreisau), Poland, 1989.]]
Taking advantage of the historic political changes occurring in East Germany, Kohl presented a ten point plan for &quot;Overcoming of the division of Germany and Europe&quot; without consulting his coalition partner, the FDP, or the Western Allies. In February 1990, he visited the Soviet Union seeking a guarantee from Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] that the USSR would allow German reunification to proceed. On 18 May 1990, he signed an economic and social union treaty with East Germany. Against the will of the [[Karl Otto Pöhl|president of the German federal bank]], he allowed a 1:1 exchange rate for wages, interest and rent between the [[German mark|West]] and [[East German mark|East Marks]]. In the end, this policy would seriously hurt companies in the [[new federal states]]. Together with Foreign Minister [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]], Kohl was able to resolve talks with the former Allies of World War II to allow [[German reunification]] and the expansion of the NATO into the former East German state. On 3 October 1990, the East German state was abolished and its territory reunified with West Germany. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Kohl confirmed that [[Historical Eastern Germany|historically German territories]] east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]] were definitively part of the [[Republic of Poland]], thereby finally ending the West German territorial claims. In 1993, Kohl confirmed, in a treaty with the Czech Republic, that Germany would no longer bring forward territorial claims as to the pre-1945 [[ethnic German]] so-called [[Sudetenland]]. This was a disappointment for the  German [[Heimatvertriebene]], displaced persons.

==Chancellor of reunified Germany==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-0916-021, Dresden, CDU-Wahlveranstaltung, Helmut Kohl.jpg|thumb|Helmut Kohl in 1990.]]
Reunification placed Kohl in a momentarily unassailable position.  In the [[German federal election, 1990|1990 elections]]{{ndash}} the first free, fair and democratic all-German elections since the [[Weimar Republic]] era{{ndash}} Kohl won by a landslide over opposition candidate and Minister-President of [[Saarland]], [[Oskar Lafontaine]]. He then formed his [[Cabinet Kohl IV|fourth cabinet]].

After the [[German federal election, 1994|federal elections of 1994]] Kohl was narrowly re-elected. He defeated the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate [[Rudolf Scharping]]. The SPD was however able to win a majority in the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]], which significantly limited Kohl's power. In foreign politics, Kohl was more successful, for instance getting [[Frankfurt am Main]] as the seat for the [[European Central Bank]]. In 1997, Kohl received the [[Vision for Europe Award]] for his efforts in the unification of Europe.

By the late 1990s, the aura surrounding Kohl had largely worn off amid rising unemployment. He was heavily defeated in the [[German federal election, 1998|1998 federal elections]] by the Minister-President of [[Lower Saxony]], [[Gerhard Schröder]].

==Retirement and legal troubles==

A [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|red]]-[[Alliance '90/The Greens|green]] coalition government led by Schröder replaced Kohl's government on 27 October 1998. He immediately resigned as CDU leader and largely retired from politics.  However, he remained a member of the Bundestag until he decided not to run for reelection in the [[German federal election, 2002|2002 election]].

===CDU finance affair===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=August 2010}}
{{Update|the extradition of Schreiber|type=section|date=August 2010}}
Kohl's life after political office in the beginning was dominated by the [[1999 CDU contributions scandal|CDU-party finance scandal]].

The party financing scandal became public in 1999, when it was discovered that the CDU had received and kept illegal donations during Kohl's leadership.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spiegel(08/07/2009)&quot;&gt;Gerd Langguth, &quot;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,640938,00.html The scandal that helped Merkel become chancellor]&quot;, ''[[Der Spiegel#Spiegel_Online|Spiegel Online]] International'', 8 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reference necessary|Investigations by the Bundestag into the sources of illegal CDU funds, mainly stored in Geneva bank accounts, revealed two sources. One was the sale of German tanks to [[Saudi Arabia]] (kickback question), while the other was the privatization fraud in collusion with the late French President [[François Mitterrand]] who wanted 2,550 unused allotments in the former East Germany for the then French owned [[Elf Aquitaine]]. In December 1994 the CDU majority in the Bundestag enacted a law that nullified all rights of the current owners. Over 300 million DM in illegal funds were discovered in accounts in the [[canton of Geneva]]. The fraudulently acquired allotments were then privatized as part of Elf Aquitaine and ended up with TotalFinaElf, now [[Total S.A.]], after amalgamation.|date=November 2009}}

{{Reference necessary|Kohl himself claimed that Elf Aquitaine had offered (and meanwhile made) a massive investment in East Germany's chemical industry together with the takeover of 2,000 gas stations in Germany which were formerly owned by national oil company [[Minol]]. Elf Aquitaine is supposed to have financed CDU illegally, as ordered by Mitterrand, as it was usual practice in African countries.|date=November 2009}}

{{Reference necessary|Kohl and other German and French politicians defended themselves that they were promoting reconciliation and cooperation between France and Germany for the sake of European integration and peace, and that they had no personal motives for accepting foreign party funding.|date=November 2009}}

{{Reference necessary|These scandal matters are still under investigation. The German-Canadian businessman [[Karlheinz Schreiber]], a longtime associate of Kohl's late CSU political rival Franz Josef Strauß, is wanted by Bavarian prosecutors on charges of fraud and corruption, but Schreiber has been fighting [[extradition]] from Canada to Germany for more than eight years, since the summer of 1999. Schreiber who is freed on bail in Canada as of April, 2008, filed an affidavit implicating former Canadian Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]], another business associate of his. The Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] called on 13 November 2007, for a [[Karlheinz Schreiber#Public inquiry|public inquiry]] to probe Schreiber's statements.|date=June 2011}}{{Relevance note|date=September 2011}}

In 2002, Kohl left the Bundestag and officially retired from politics. In recent years, Kohl has been largely rehabilitated by his party again. After taking office, [[Angela Merkel]] invited her former patron to the Chancellor's Office and Ronald Pofalla, the Secretary-General of the CDU, announced that the CDU will cooperate more closely with Kohl, &quot;to take advantage of the experience of this great statesman&quot;, as Pofalla put it. However, Kohl has retreated from public life to a far greater extent than his predecessor Helmut Schmidt.

On 5 July 2001, [[Hannelore Kohl]], his wife, committed suicide, after suffering from [[photodermatitis]] for years. On 4 March 2004, he published the first of his memoirs, called &quot;Memories 1930–1982&quot;, covering the period 1930 to 1982, when he became chancellor. The second part, published on 3 November 2005, included the first half of his chancellorship (from 1982 to 1990). On 28 December 2004, Kohl was air-lifted by the [[Sri Lanka]]n Air Force, after having been stranded in a hotel by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]].

He is a member of the [[Club of Madrid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cdm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clubmadrid.org/cmadrid/index.php?id=161 |title=Helmut Kohl |publisher=Club of Madrid |accessdate=2008-03-01 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071014222641/http://www.clubmadrid.org/cmadrid/index.php?id=161 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As reported in the German press, he also gave his name to the soon-to-be launched [[Helmut Kohl Centre for European Studies]] (currently 'Centre for European Studies'), which is the new political foundation of the [[European People's Party]].

In April 2008, Kohl was reported to be in intensive care due to a falling accident earlier in the year, and incapable of speaking.  Subsequent to his recovery, he married his 43-year-old partner, Maike Richter, on 8 May 2008.

In 2010, he had a gall bladder operation in Heidelberg.&lt;ref&gt;Bunte: http://www.bunte.de/newsline/helmut-kohl-altkanzler-uebersteht-operation-gut_aid_14807.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
In international politics Kohl was committed to [[European integration]], maintaining close relations with the French president [[François Mitterrand|Mitterrand]]. Parallel to this he was committed to [[German reunification]]. Although he continued the [[Ostpolitik]] of his social-democratic predecessor, Kohl also supported Reagan's more aggressive policies in order to weaken the [[USSR]].

==Public perception==

Kohl faced stiff opposition from the West German political left and was as well mocked upon for his provincial background, physical stature and simple language. Similar to historical French cartoons of [[Louis-Philippe of France]], [[Hans Traxler]] depicted Kohl as a ''pear'' in the left leaning satirical journal [[Titanic (magazine)|Titanic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taz.de/1/leben/kuenste/artikel/1/der-erfinder-der-%5Cbirne%5C/ Hans Traxler wird 80, Der Erfinder der &quot;Birne&quot;] (Hans Traxler 80, the inventor of the ''pear'') Taz 20.05.2009&lt;/ref&gt; The German expression ''Birne'' (&quot;[[pear]]&quot;) became a widespread nickname and symbol for the Chancellor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/883/312794/text/ Birne auf Breitwand, Dreharbeiten zu &quot;Helmut Kohl - Der Film&quot;] (The pear in Cinemascope - Shooting of ''Helmut Kohl - the film) Sueddeutsche Zeitung 05.10.2008, 15:40&lt;/ref&gt; Kohl became one of the most popular politicians in some regions of Eastern Germany and  a greatly respected European statesman.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

'''Horst Köhler''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhɔɐ̯st ˈkøːlɐ|pron|De-Horst Köhler.ogg}}; born 22 February 1943) is a German politician of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]]. He was [[President of Germany]] from 2004 to 2010. As the candidate of the two Christian Democratic sister parties, the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] and the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]], and the liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]], Köhler was [[German presidential election, 2004|elected]] to his first five-year term by the [[Bundesversammlung (Germany)|Federal Assembly]] on 23 May 2004 and was subsequently inaugurated on 1 July 2004. He was [[German presidential election, 2009|reelected]] to a second term on 23 May 2009. Just a year later, on 31 May 2010, he resigned from his office in a controversy over his comment on the role of the German [[Bundeswehr]] in light of a visit to the troops in [[Afghanistan]].

Köhler is an [[economics|economist]] by profession. Prior to his election as President, Köhler had a distinguished career in politics and the civil service and as a banking executive. He was President of the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] from 1998 to 2000 and head of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) from 2000 to 2004.

Because the office of President is less influential than that of the [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] and is mostly concerned with ceremonial matters, Köhler was a highly popular politician during his tenure. He has called for more influence for the President and has suggested the President should be directly elected (as was the case under Germany's [[Weimar Constitution]]).

== Early life ==
Köhler was born in [[Skierbieszów]] (then named Heidenstein), in the [[General Government]] area of [[German-occupied Poland]], as the seventh child of Elisabeth and Eduard Köhler, into a family of [[Bessarabia Germans|Bessarabian Germans]] from [[Rîşcani]] in [[Romania]]n [[Bessarabia]] (near [[Bălţi]], present-day [[Moldova]]). Horst Köhler's parents, ethnic Germans and Romanian citizens, had to leave their home in Bessarabia in 1940 during the [[Nazi-Soviet population transfers]] that followed the invasion of Poland and the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], which awarded Bessarabia to the [[Soviet Union]]. As part of the [[Generalplan Ost]], they were resettled in 1942 at [[Skierbieszów]], a village near [[Zamość]], [[Poland]] (then part of the [[General Government]]). As the [[Wehrmacht]] was pushed back and the first parts of Poland had to be abandoned in 1944, the Köhler family fled to [[Leipzig]]. In 1953, they left the [[German Democratic Republic|Soviet Zone]] – via [[West Berlin]] – to escape from the communist regime. The family lived in [[refugee camp]]s until 1957, when they settled in [[Ludwigsburg]]. Horst Köhler hence spent most of his first 14 years as a refugee.

==Studies and military service==
A teacher recommended that the refugee boy should apply for the [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]], and Köhler took his ''[[Abitur]]'' in 1963. After a two-year military service at a [[Panzergrenadier]] battalion in [[Ellwangen]], he left the [[Bundeswehr]] as  &quot;[[Leutnant]] der Reserve&quot; (reserve officer). He studied and finally earned a [[doctorate]] in [[economics]] and [[political science]]s from [[Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen]], where he was a scientific research assistant at the Institute for Applied Economic Research from 1969 to 1976.

==Career in the civil service==

Köhler joined the civil service in 1976, when he was employed in the [[Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Economics]]. In 1981, he was employed in the Chancellory of the state government in [[Schleswig-Holstein]] under Prime Minister [[Gerhard Stoltenberg]]. The following year, Köhler was made head of the Ministers office in the [[Federal Ministry of Finance (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Finance]], upon Stoltenberg's recommendation. He rose to head of department in 1987, with responsibility for financial policy and federal industrial interests. In 1989 he became head of the department for currency and credit.

==Secretary of State in the Ministry of Finance==
A member of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] since 1981, he was Secretary of State in the Federal Ministry of Finance from 1990 to 1993, and as such, the administrative head of the Ministry and the deputy of the Federal Minister of Finance ([[Theodor Waigel]]). In that capacity, he served as a &quot;[[Sherpa (G8)|sherpa]]&quot; (personal representative) for [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]], preparing  [[G7]] summits and other international economic conferences. He also served as the primary German negotiator in the [[Maastricht Treaty]] negotiations.

==Career in banking 1993–2000==

Between 1993 and 1998 he served as President of the association of savings banks in Germany, [[Deutscher Sparkassen- und Giroverband]]. In 1998 he was appointed president of the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]], and settled in [[London]], where the headquarters of the bank is located.

==Head of the International Monetary Fund==

[[File:Bono U2 with Horst Köhler at Prague 2000 IMF.jpeg|thumb|200px|Köhler as head of the IMF, discussing [[debt relief]] for [[Developing countries' debt|developing countries]] with the musician [[Bono]]]]
Köhler was appointed Managing Director and Chairman of the Executive Board of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) in 2000.  The government of [[Gerhard Schröder]] nominated him after their first nominee, [[Caio Koch-Weser]], was rejected by the United States.

He lived in [[Washington, D.C.]], from 2000 to 2004.

==President of Germany==
[[File:Václav Havel and Horst Köhler.jpg|175px|thumb|left|Horst Köhler and [[Vaclav Havel]], 2000]]

On 4 March 2004, Köhler resigned his post with the IMF after being nominated by Germany's conservative and liberal opposition parties as their presidential candidate. As these parties controlled a majority of votes in the ''[[Bundesversammlung (Germany)|Bundesversammlung]]'' (an electoral college consisting of the membership of the [[Bundestag]] and an equal number of delegates appointed by the legislatures of each [[States of Germany|state]]), the result of the vote amounted to essentially a foregone conclusion, but was closer than expected.  Köhler defeated [[Gesine Schwan]] on the first ballot by 604 votes to 580; 20 votes were cast for minor candidates, while one elector was absent because of a heart attack. Köhler succeeded [[Johannes Rau]] as President on 1 July 2004, for a five-year term.  Germany's presidency is a largely ceremonial office, but is also invested with considerable moral authority. From 2004 until early 2006, [[Charlottenburg Palace]] was the seat of the President of Germany, whilst [[Schloss Bellevue]] was being renovated.

Upon his election, Köhler, a conservative German [[patriotism|patriot]], said that &quot;Patriotism and being cosmopolitan are not opposites&quot;. &quot;He appeared an enlightened patriot who genuinely loves his country and is not afraid to say so&quot;, the newspaper ''[[Die Welt]]'' wrote. Presenting his visions for Germany, Köhler also said that &quot;Germany should become a land of ideas&quot;, and emphasized the importance of globalization, and that Germany would have to compete for its place in the 21st century. 

In July 2005, he suspended the Bundestag at Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]]'s request, after the latter had lost a motion of confidence in the Bundestag. This led to early election for the Bundestag in September 2005.

[[File:Horst Köhler in Brackenheim am 31. Januar 2009.jpg|thumb|Horst Köhler in [[Brackenheim]] after unveiling a bronze statue of [[Theodor Heuss]]]]
In October 2006, he made a far-reaching decision by vetoing the bill which would transfer Germany's Air Safety Administration [[Deutsche Flugsicherung]] into private ownership. The [[Bundestag]] passed this legislation but as President, Köhler was authorized not to sign it into law if, in his opinion, it contravenes the constitution. In December 2006 he did not sign the Consumer Information Law (which intended to make information collected by public food safety agencies available to consumers), because the constitution does not allow the federal government to instruct municipal authorities. This can only be done by the German states. There had only been six previous occasions when Germany's president had chosen to reject bills, in most instances less important legislation was involved. His vetoes were the first notable examples in recent German history.

In his 2007 Christmas address to the nation, Köhler urged the government to push ahead more quickly with reforms. He was also critical of the introduction of the [[minimum wage]] in the postal sector (which had led to the loss of 1000 jobs at [[Deutsche Post]] rival [[PIN Group]]), stating that &quot;a minimum wage that cannot be paid by competitive employers destroys jobs&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;German President criticises minimum wages&quot;&gt;Stuttgarter Zeitung, 29 December 2007 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May 2008, Köhler announced his candidacy for a second term as president. On 23 May 2009 he was re-elected by the [[Bundesversammlung (Germany)|Federal Assembly]],&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news   | title = German president wins re-election| publisher = BBC  | date = 23 May 2009  | url =  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8065167.stm | accessdate = 23 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was sworn into office for a second term on 1 July 2009.

===Resignation===
On 31 May 2010, Köhler announced his resignation as President of Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFP-Rücktritt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ivOge9ovvGl20_sawK1aa8afqXRw|title=Bundespräsident Köhler zurückgetreten|work=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]|date=31 May 2010|accessdate=31 May 2010|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came after German politicians criticised comments made by Köhler in relation to overseas military deployments:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/10198036.stm|title=German President Koehler quits amid row over military|date=31 May 2010|accessdate=31 May 2010|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|{{lang|de|&quot;Meine Einschätzung ist aber, dass insgesamt wir auf dem Wege sind, doch auch in der Breite der Gesellschaft zu verstehen, dass ein Land unserer Größe mit dieser Außenhandelsorientierung und damit auch Außenhandelsabhängigkeit auch wissen muss, dass im Zweifel, im Notfall auch militärischer Einsatz notwendig ist, um unsere Interessen zu wahren, zum Beispiel freie Handelswege, zum Beispiel ganze regionale Instabilitäten zu verhindern, die mit Sicherheit dann auch auf unsere Chancen zurückschlagen negativ durch Handel, Arbeitsplätze und Einkommen. Alles das soll diskutiert werden und ich glaube, wir sind auf einem nicht so schlechten Weg.&quot;}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;In my estimation, though, we—including [German] society as a whole—are coming to the general understanding that, given this [strong] focus and corresponding dependency on exports, a country of our size needs to be aware that where called for or in an emergency, military deployment, too, is necessary if we are to protect our interests such as ensuring free trade routes or preventing regional instabilities which are also certain to negatively impact our ability to safeguard trade, jobs and income. All of this should be discussed and I think the path we are on is not so bad.&quot;|Horst Köhler|Interview with [[Deutschlandradio]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ricke |first=Christopher |title=Sie leisten wirklich Großartiges unter schwierigsten Bedingungen |date=22 May 2010 |work=Deutschlandradio |url=http://www.dradio.de/dkultur/sendungen/interview/1188780/}}&lt;/ref&gt;|22 May 2010}}

After coming under criticism for his statements that Germany’s military missions abroad also served to secure trade, critics accused him of advocating the use of &quot;[[gunboat diplomacy]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5d856e60-6f3a-11df-9f43-00144feabdc0.html&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently stated that his comments referred to piracy off the coast of Somalia. Köhler stated that there was no substance to accusations that in the interview he had overstepped his formal role by favoring an unconstitutional position. After getting no substantial support in the dispute, Köhler stepped down on 31 May 2010, issuing a statement saying &quot;I declare my resignation from the Office of President, with immediate effect.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Controversy Over Afghanistan Remarks: German President Horst Köhler Resigns&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,697785,00.html|title=Controversy Over Afghanistan Remarks: German President Horst Köhler Resigns|date=31 May 2010|accessdate=31 May 2010|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resignation was considered a &quot;surprise&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704366504575278212516510890.html|title=German President Horst Köhler Steps Down|date=31 May 2010|accessdate=31 May 2010|publisher=The Wall Street Journal | first=Marcus | last=Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both pundits and opposition politicians labeled it &quot;an overreaction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,697794,00.html|title=Reaktionen zum Köhler-Rücktritt: 'Ich kann es kaum glauben'|date=31 May 2010|accessdate=31 May 2010|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tagesthemen.de/inland/koehlerruecktritt104.html|title=Der Bundespräsident im Porträt|date=31 May 2010|accessdate=31 May 2010|publisher=[[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following days he was criticized for not being able to handle criticism while being a rigorous critic himself. His unprecedented act of immediate resignation was also considered showing a lack of respect for his position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,697920,00.html|title=Pressestimmen zum Köhler-Rücktritt: Der 'Absteiger des Jahres' stürzt sich selbst|date=1 June 2010|accessdate=4 June 2010|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

As stipulated by the [[German constitution]], the powers of the vacant office were executed by the current President of the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]], [[Jens Böhrnsen]], until [[Christian Wulff]] was elected president on 30 June 2010 and resigned on 17 February 2012.

== Personal life ==
Horst Köhler is married to [[Eva Köhler]], a teacher.

'''Joachim Sauer''' (born April 19, 1949) is a German [[quantum chemistry|quantum chemist]], full professor at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. He is the husband of the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor of Germany]], [[Angela Merkel]].

== Scientific career ==
Sauer studied chemistry from [[1967]] to [[1972]] at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] and was awarded a [[doctorate]] in chemistry in 1974. He continued to do research there until 1977 when he joined the Academy of Sciences, Central Institute of Physical Chemistry in Berlin, one of the leading scientific institutes of the former [[East Germany|GDR]] ([[East Germany]]).

For a brief time during and after the [[German reunification]] (1990–1991) he was the Deputy Technical Director (Catalysis and Sorption) for BIOSYM Technologies, San Diego/USA (now [[Accelrys]]). He remained an advisor for BIOSYM until 2002.

In [[1992]] he joined the [[Max Planck Society]] as Head of the Quantum Chemistry Group in Berlin. Since 1993 he has been a full professor of Physical and Theoretical Chemistry at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. He is an active research scientist in quantum chemistry and computational chemistry.

== Personal life ==
From his previous marriage to a fellow chemist, Sauer has two sons, Daniel and Adrian.
On December 30, 1998, he married [[Angela Merkel]] (herself a doctor of physics who had once worked in quantum chemistry research), who later became chairperson of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] and on November 22, 2005, first female [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor of Germany]].

== Public visibility as husband of Angela Merkel ==
[[Image:Merkel-Bush-L.Bush-Sauer.jpg|thumb|Sauer (right) with [[Angela Merkel]], [[George W. Bush]] and [[Laura Bush]]]]
Due to the political career of his wife Sauer has gained far more public visibility than usual for a research scientist. On several occasions he said he is not fond of this publicity.

During the 2005 election campaign Joachim Sauer kept a very low profile, declining to give any interviews not related to his scientific work. After attending the [[Bayreuth Festival]] (an opera festival and a highly visible social event in Germany) with his wife, he was nicknamed &quot;the [[Phantom of the Opera]]&quot; by the German press.&lt;ref name=Phantom&gt;{{cite web | first=David | last=Crossland | title=Merkel's Phantom of the Opera | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,386384,00.html | publisher=[[Der_Spiegel#Spiegel_Online|Spiegel Online]] | date=2005-11-22 | accessdate=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. Sauer is known as a great lover of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner's]] music.

Even during his wife's election in the [[Bundestag]], her [[inauguration]], and later her taking the oath of office, Sauer was not present but reportedly briefly followed the event on TV from his university chemistry lab.&lt;ref name=QuantumLeap&gt;{{cite web | first=Craig | last=Whitlock | title=The Professor's Quantum Leap | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/07/AR2007060702139.html | publisher=[[The Washington Post]] | date=2007-06-08 | accessdate=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day Germany's biggest tabloid ''[[Bild-Zeitung]]'' displayed the headline &quot;Merkel - wo war ihr Mann?&quot; (&quot;Merkel - where was her husband?&quot;)

'''Jürgen Trittin''' (born 25 July 1954) is a [[Germany|German]] [[Bündnis 90/Die Grünen|Green]] politician. He was Federal [[Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (Germany)|Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety]] from 1998 to 2005 in Germany.

== Life and work ==

Trittin was born in [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]]. He earned a university degree in [[Social Economy]] in [[Göttingen]] and worked as journalist.

His political career started in 1982 as Secretary of the Alternative-Greens-Initiative List (AGIL) Group in the Göttingen City Council (until 1984). From 1984 to 1985, he worked as Press Spokesman for the Greens Group in the [[Lower Saxony]] State Assembly, which he joined in 1985 as member of the state parliament. 

From 1990 to 1994, Jürgen Trittin was the Lower Saxony Minister for Federal and [[European Union|European Affairs]] and the Head of the Lower Saxony State Mission to the Federal Government in a coalition cabinet with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]], led by then minister president of Lower Saxony [[Gerhard Schröder]] (SPD).

After Schröder's SPD won an absolute majority in the state elections in 1994, the coalition with the Greens was ended. Trittin now worked as Member of the [[Lower Saxony]] State Assembly and as Deputy Chairman of the [[Alliance 90/The Greens]] group in that parliament. In 1994, he became Spokesman (Chairman) of the national [[Green Party (Germany)|Green Party]]. 

In 1998, Trittin was elected as Member of the federal parliament ([[Bundestag]]). At the same time he discontinued his work as Spokesman, because party statutes do not allow concurrently being a member of parliament and a member of the party executive.

In the federal red-green coalition cabinet, he was appointed  Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, a role which he held from October 1998 until the Grand coalition took power in 2005. In this position he was responsible for the decision to abandon the use of [[nuclear power]] by 2020, called the [[nuclear power phase-out]] (see [[Nuclear power in Germany]]). 

In August 2005, he responded to a question on how best to react to the 2005 petrol prices crisis with &quot;leave the car at home from time to time.&quot; The media, in particular [[Bild-Zeitung|Bild]], attacked these comments.

At the time of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in August/September 2005, Trittin wrote an opinion piece in the newspaper [[Frankfurter Rundschau]] associating the U.S.'s failure to sign the [[Kyoto protocol]] with the hurricane and its devastation.

Trittin is single and father to one daughter.

==Criticism==
On Monday 12 September 2011, the Vice Chancellor, [[Philipp Rösler| Dr. Philipp Rösler]], after receiving some ''sensitive and classified'' information, wrote an article in the newspaper [[Die Welt]], explaining the possible benefits of a greek bankruptcy for the rest of the Eurozone member countries. Two days later, Jürgen Trittin, as well as a politician from the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)| F.D.P.]], [[Jorgo Chatzimarkakis]], being unaware of the information, asked the Chancellor [[Angela Merkel| Dr. Angela Dorothea Merkel]], to expel him from the government.

'''Philipp Rösler''' (born 24 February 1973&lt;ref group=&quot;fn&quot;&gt;His exact date of birth is unknown; 24 February 1973 is used in official documents&lt;/ref&gt;) is a Vietnamese-born [[Germany|German]] politician, who, since 2011, has been the [[Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (Germany)|Federal Minister of Economics and Technology]] and the [[Vice Chancellor of Germany]]. He is the Chairman of the liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (since 2011).

A physician by profession, he served as Minister for Economics and Deputy Prime Minister of the state of [[Lower Saxony]] February–October 2009. He was the [[Federal Ministry of Health (Germany)|Federal Minister of Health]] in the [[Merkel Cabinet II|second Merkel Cabinet]] from 2009 to 2011 and became [[Federal Minister of Economics and Technology (Germany)|Federal Minister of Economics and Technology]] in the cabinet in 2011. He is of [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] origin and was adopted by a German couple when he was still an infant.

==Life and career==
Philipp Rösler was born in [[Khanh Hung]], Ba Xuyen Province, in the former [[South Vietnam]] (now [[Soc Trang Province]], [[Vietnam]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bild.de/BILD/politik/2009/11/01/philipp-roesler-schwester-mary/besuch-im-waisenheim.html|date=2009-11-01|accessdate=2009-11-02|title=Erinnern Sie sich an diesen Waisenjungen, Schwester?|author=Von Jurgen Damsch|publisher=Bild}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[http://www.landtag-niedersachsen.de/Abgeordnete/abgeordnete.htm landtag-niedersachsen.de]&lt;/ref&gt; He was adopted from a Roman Catholic orphanage near [[Saigon]] (now [[Ho Chi Minh City]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,3998647,00.html|title=Our guest on 08.02.2009 Philipp Rösler, Politician and Doctor |publisher=Deusche Welle|date=2009-02-08|accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a [[German people|German]] couple that already had two biological children and then Rösler was brought to Germany at the age of nine months.&lt;ref name=&quot;de&quot;/&gt; He grew up in [[Hamburg]], [[Bückeburg]] and [[Hanover]], where he graduated from high school in 1992. After training to become a [[combat medic]] in the German [[Bundeswehr]] (the Federal Defense Force), Rösler was exempted to study medicine at the [[Hannover Medical School]]. Following this, he continued his education at the Bundeswehr hospital in Hamburg. He received his Dr. med degree in 2002 and left service as a [[Bundeswehr Joint Medical Service#Ranks of the Bundeswehr Joint Medical Service|Stabsarzt]] (a rank for German medical officers equivalent to an army captain)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cicero.de/97.php?item=3368 cicero.de] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.munzinger.de/search/portrait/Philipp+R%C3%B6sler/0/26206.html Biography at munzinger.de] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He is a Roman Catholic,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecumene.radiovaticana.org/ted/articolo.asp?c=476157&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of the General Conference of the [[Central Committee of German Catholics]]. He has been married to Wiebke Rösler, also a physician, since 2003. The couple have twin girls, Grietje and Gesche, born in 2008.

==Political career==
Rösler has been a member of the FDP and its political youth organisation, the Young Liberals, since 1992. He was secretary of the FDP in the state of [[Lower Saxony]] from 2000 until 2004 and has been chairman of the FDP parliamentary group in the [[Landtag of Lower Saxony|Lower Saxon state assembly]] since 2003.  From 2001 until 2006, Rösler was a member in the regional assembly of Hanover (district), where he was also deputy chairman of the parliamentary group. In May, 2005, he was elected an observer of the federal FDP executive committee. He received 95% of the votes, the best result of that party conference. At the state party conference in March, 2006, Rösler was elected as chairman of the Lower Saxon FDP with 96,4% of the votes; he succeeded Walter Hirche, who had decided to step down after twelve years at the helm. In April, 2008, Rösler was confirmed as the Lower Saxon FDP party chairman, receiving 95% of the votes.

At the federal party conference in June, 2007, Rösler was re-elected as a member of the party executive committee. The following month, he was elected to stand as his party’s main candidate in the [[Lower Saxony state election, 2008|Lower Saxon state election]] in January, 2008.  In that election, he received 10.9% of the votes in his local constituency, [[Hanover]]-Döhren. On February 18, 2008, Rösler was appointed minister for economy, labour and transport&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/blitzkarriere-an-der-leine;2120933 handelsblatt.com]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as deputy prime minister of the state of Lower Saxony.

In October 2009, Rösler succeeded [[Ulla Schmidt]] as [[Federal Ministry of Health (Germany)|Federal Minister of Health]] in [[Angela Merkel]]'s cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,657086,00.html Spiegel.de]&lt;/ref&gt;
Rösler succeeded [[Rainer Brüderle]] as Federal Minister of Economics and Technology on 12 May 2011 and [[Guido Westerwelle]] as Chairman of the FDP on 13 May 2011 and was also instated as [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany]] on 16 May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gessat|first=Michael|title=Vietnam-born doctor takes reins of German liberal party|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=May 13, 2011|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15073300,00.html|accessdate=May 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;appointment&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Philipp Rösler neuer Vizekanzler|publisher=[[German government]]|language=German|date=May 18, 2011|url=http://www.bundesregierung.de/nn_1264/Content/DE/Artikel/2011/05/2011-05-18-vizekanzler-roesler.html|accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rösler strongly supported the presidential candidacy of [[Joachim Gauck]], originally proposed by the SPD and Greens, and reportedly secured his nomination by convincing his coalition partner, the [[CDU/CSU]], to back the nomination.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/schwarz-gelb-nach-der-entscheidung-fuer-gauck-roesler-feiert-einen-gefaehrlichen-sieg-1.1288748&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Physical chemistry''' is the study of macroscopic, atomic, subatomic, and particulate phenomena in chemical systems in terms of physical laws and concepts.  It applies the principles, practices and concepts of [[physics]] such as [[Motion (physics)|motion]], [[energy]], [[force]], [[time]], [[thermodynamics]], [[quantum chemistry]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]].

Physical chemistry, in contrast to [[chemical physics]], is predominantly (but not always) a macroscopic or supra-molecular science, as the majority of the principles on which physical chemistry was founded, are concepts related to the bulk rather than on molecular/atomic structure alone. For example, [[chemical equilibrium]], and [[colloids]].

Some of the relationships that physical chemistry strives to resolve include the effects of:
#[[Intermolecular forces]] that act upon the physical properties of materials ([[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]], [[tensile strength]], [[surface tension]] in [[liquid]]s).
#[[Chemical kinetics|Reaction kinetics]] on the [[Reaction rate|rate of a reaction]].
#The identity of ions on the electrical conductivity of materials.
#[[Surface chemistry]] and [[electrochemistry]] of [[cell membrane|membranes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=v1oU13xAl6AC&amp;pg=RA1-PA134|page=134|title=Surface chemistry and electrochemistry of membranes|author=Torben Smith Sørensen|publisher=CRC Press|year=1999|isbn=0824719220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key concepts ==

The key concepts of physical chemistry are the ways in which pure physics is applied to chemical problems.

One of the key concept in chemistry is that all [[chemical species | chemical compounds]] can be described as groups of [[atoms]] [[chemical bond | bonded]] together and [[chemical reactions]] can be described as the making and breaking of those bonds. Predicting the properties of chemical compounds from a description of atoms and how they bond is one of the major goals of physical chemistry. To describe the atoms and bonds precisely, it is necessary to know both where the [[atomic nucleus | nuclei]] of the atoms are, and how electrons are distributed around them.&lt;ref name=Atkins249&gt;Atkins, Peter and Friedman, Ronald (2005). ''Molecular Quantum Mechanics'', p. 249. Oxford University Press, New York. ISBN 0199274983.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quantum chemistry]], a subfield of physical chemistry especially concerned with the application of [[quantum mechanics]] to chemical problems, provides tools to determine how strong and what shape bonds are,&lt;ref name=Atkins249 /&gt; how nuclei move, and how light can be absorbed or emitted by a chemical compound.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, Peter and Friedman, Ronald (2005). ''Molecular Quantum Mechanics'', p. 342. Oxford University Press, New York. ISBN 0199274983.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spectroscopy]] is the related sub-discipline of physical chemistry which is specifically concerned with the interaction of [[electromagnetic radiation]] with matter.

Another set of important questions in chemistry concerns what kind of reactions can happen spontaneously and which properties are possible for a given chemical mixture. This is studied in [[chemical thermodynamics]], which sets limits on quantities like how far a reaction can proceed, or how much energy can be converted into work in a [[combustion engine]] and which provides links between properties like the [[thermal expansion coefficient]] and change of rate in [[entropy]] with [[pressure]] for a [[gas]] or a [[liquid]].&lt;ref&gt;Landau, L. D. and Lifshitz, E. M. (1980). ''Statistical Physics'', 3rd Ed. p. 52. Elsevier Butterworth Heinemann, New York. ISBN 0750633727.&lt;/ref&gt; It can frequently be used to assess whether a reactor or engine design is feasible, or to check the validity of experimental data. To a limited extent, [[quasi-equilibrium]] and [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics | non-equilibrium]] thermodynamics can describe irreversible changes.&lt;ref name=Hill1&gt;Hill, Terrell L. (1986). ''Introduction to Statistical Thermodynamics'', p. 1. Dover Publications, New York. ISBN 0486652424.&lt;/ref&gt; However, classical thermodynamics is mostly concerned with systems in [[Thermodynamic equilibrium | equilibrium]] and [[Reversible process | reversible changes]] and not what actually does happen, or how fast, away from equilibrium.

Which reactions do occur and how fast is the subject of [[chemical kinetics]], another branch of physical chemistry. A key idea in chemical kinetics is that for [[reagent | reactants]] to react and form [[ Product (chemistry) | products]], most chemical species must go through [[Transition state | transition states]] which are higher in [[Thermodynamic free energy | energy]] than either the reactants or the products and serve as a barrier to reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Lanny D. (2005). ''The Engineering of Chemical Reactions'', 2nd Ed. p. 30. Oxford University Press, New York. ISBN 0195169255.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the higher the barrier, the slower the reaction. A second is that most chemical reactions occur as a sequence of [[elementary reaction | elementary reactions]],&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Lanny D. (2005). ''The Engineering of Chemical Reactions'', 2nd Ed. p. 25, 32. Oxford University Press, New York. ISBN 0195169255.&lt;/ref&gt; each with its own transition state. Key questions in kinetics include how the rate of reaction depends on temperature and on the concentrations of reactants and [[catalysts]] in the reaction mixture, as well as how catalysts and reaction conditions can be engineered to optimize the reaction rate.

The fact that how fast reactions occur can often be specified with just a few concentrations and a temperature, instead of needing to know all the positions and speeds of every molecule in a mixture, is a special case of another key concept in physical chemistry, which is that to the extent an engineer needs to know, everything going on in a mixture of [[Avogadro constant | millions of billions of billions]] of particles can often be described by just a few variables like pressure, temperature, and concentration. The precise reasons for this are described in [[statistical mechanics]],&lt;ref name=Chandler&gt;Chandler, David (1987). ''Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics'', p. 54. Oxford University Press, New York. ISBN 9780195042771.&lt;/ref&gt; a specialty within physical chemistry which is also shared with physics. Statistical mechanics also provides ways to predict the properties we see in everyday life from molecular properties without relying on empirical correlations based on chemical similarities.&lt;ref name=Hill1 /&gt;

{{See also|History of chemistry}}
[[File:Lomonosov Chymiae Physicae 1752.jpg|thumb|right|Fragment of M. Lomonosov's manuscript 'Physical Chemistry' (1752)]]
The term &quot;physical chemistry&quot; was coined by [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] in 1752, when he presented a lecture course entitled &quot;A Course in True Physical Chemistry&quot; (Russian: «Курс истинной физической химии») before the students of [[Petersburg University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YoE1wsA6USQC&amp;pg=PA388|page=388|title=Science in Russian culture|author=Alexander Vucinich|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1963|isbn=0804707383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern physical chemistry originated in the 1860s to 1880s with work on [[chemical thermodynamics]], [[electrolyte]]s in solutions, [[chemical kinetics]] and other subjects. One milestone was the publication in 1876 by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] of his paper, ''[[On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances]]''.  This paper introduced several of the cornerstones of physical chemistry, such as [[Gibbs free energy|Gibbs energy]], [[chemical potential]]s, [[Gibbs phase rule]].&lt;ref&gt;Josiah Willard Gibbs, 1876, &quot;[[On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances]]&quot;, ''Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Sciences''&lt;/ref&gt; Other milestones include the subsequent naming and accreditation of [[enthalpy]] to [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]] and to [[macromolecular]] processes. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The first [[scientific journal]] specifically in the field of physical chemistry was the German journal, ''[[Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie]]'', founded in 1887 by [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] and [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]]. Together with [[Svante August Arrhenius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Laidler|first = Keith|authorlink = Keith J. Laidler
| title = The World of Physical Chemistry|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1993| location = Oxford|pages = 48|isbn = 0198559194}}&lt;/ref&gt;  these were the leading figures in physical chemistry in the late 19th century and early 20th century. All three were awarded with the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] between 1901-1909.

Developments in the following decades include the application of [[statistical mechanics]] to chemical systems and work on [[colloid]]s and [[surface chemistry]], where [[Irving Langmuir]] made many contributions. Another important step was the development of [[quantum mechanics]] into [[quantum chemistry]] from the 1930s, where [[Linus Pauling]] was one of the leading names. Theoretical developments have gone hand in hand with developments in experimental methods, where the use of different forms of [[spectroscopy]], such as [[infrared spectroscopy]], [[microwave spectroscopy]], [[EPR spectroscopy]] and [[NMR spectroscopy]], is probably the most important 20th century development.

Further development in physical chemistry may be attributed to discoveries in [[nuclear chemistry]], especially in isotope separation (before and during World War II), more recent discoveries in [[astrochemistry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Herbst, Eric|title = Chemistry of Star-Forming Regions|journal = Journal of Physical Chemistry A|date = May 12, 2005|volume = 109|number = 18|pages = 4017–4029 | doi = 10.1021/jp050461c|pmid=16833724}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the development of calculation algorithms in field of &quot;additive physicochemical properties&quot; (practically all of physicochemical properties, as: boiling point, critical point, surface tension, vapor pressure etc. - more than 20 in all, can be precisely calculated from chemical structure, even if such chemical molecule is still non existent), and in this area is concentrated practical importance of contemporary physical chemistry.

The '''University of Leipzig''' ({{lang-de|Universität Leipzig}}), located in [[Leipzig]] in the [[Free State of Saxony]], [[Germany]], is one of the oldest [[University|universities]] in the world and the [[List_of_universities_in_Germany#Universities_by_years_of_existence|second-oldest]] university (by consecutive years of existence) in Germany. Famous alumni include [[Goethe]], [[Wagner]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Angela Merkel]] and multiple Nobel Prize winners in Physics, Chemistry and Literature.  

The university was founded on December 2, 1409 by [[Frederick I, Elector of Saxony]] and his brother [[William II, Margrave of Meissen]], and originally comprised four faculties. Since its inception the university has enjoyed over 600 years of uninterrupted teaching and research.

== History ==
{{refimprove|section|date=December 2011}}
=== Founding and development until 1900 ===
[[File:Uniriese.jpg|thumb|Former main building in front of MDR skyscraper.]]
The university was modelled on the [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]], from which the German-speaking faculty members withdrew to Leipzig after the [[Jan Hus]] crisis and the [[Decree of Kutná Hora]]. The ''Alma mater Lipsiensis'' opened in 1409, after it had been officially endorsed by [[Pope Alexander V]] in his ''[[Bull of Acknowledgment]]'' on (September 9 of that year). Its first rector was [[Johann von Münsterberg]]. From its foundation, the [[Paulinerkirche, Leipzig|Paulinerkirche]] served as the university church. After the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] the church and the monastery buildings were donated to the university in 1544.

During the first centuries the university grew slowly and was a rather regional institution. This changed, however, during the 19th century when the university became a world class institution of higher education and research. Until the beginning of the Second World War, the University of Leipzig attracted a number of renowned scholars and later [[Nobel Prize laureate]]s. Many of the university's alumni became important scientists.

During World War II, the university was kept open throughout the war even following the destruction of the university buildings. The acting rector, [[Erich Maschke]] during the war described the continuation of the university in a memo on May 11, 1945 announcing the vote for a new rector:
{{quote|Since 4 December 1943 a fixed determination not to abandon the University of Leipzig in the most difficult hour of its more than five-hundred-year history has bonded the professors with each other and with the students. The special task of repairing the damage caused by air attacks has now broadened out to the more general duty to save the continuity of our university and preserve its substance, at the very least its indestructible kernel, through the crisis that has now reached its fullest stage. After the destruction of most of the buildings and the majority of its libraries, this kernel is represented by the professoriate alone. This is what must be preserved as the great repository of value in the university.&lt;ref&gt;Universitätsarchiv Leipzig, Rectorate 50. Quoted in {{cite book|last=Grondin|first=Jean|title=Hans-Georg Gadamer: A Biography|year=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0300098413|pages=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== The University under the German Democratic Republic ===
By the end of World War II, 60 per cent of the university's buildings and 70 per cent of its books had been destroyed. The university reopened on 5 February 1946, but it was affected by the uniformity imposed on social institutions in the [[Soviet occupation zone]]. In 1948, the freely elected student council was disbanded and was replaced by [[Free German Youth]] members. The chairman of the Student Council, Wolfgang Natonek, and other members were arrested and imprisoned, but the university was also a nucleus of resistance. Thus began the Belter group, with flyers for free elections. The head of the group, [[Herbert Belter]], paid for his commitment to democracy with his life and was executed in 1951 in Moscow. The [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] was created in 1949 and in 1953 the University was renamed by its government the '''[[Karl Marx|Karl-Marx]]-University, Leipzig'''. In 1968, the partly damaged [[Augusteum (Leipzig)|Augusteum]], including Johanneum and Albertinum and the intact [[Paulinerkirche, Leipzig|Paulinerkirche]], were demolished to make way for a redevelopment of the university, carried out between 1973 and 1978. The dominant building of the university was the University Tower (now [[City-Hochhaus Leipzig]]), built between 1968 and 1972 in the form of an open book.

=== After the reunification ===
In 1991, the University was renamed again to its original name University of Leipzig (Alma mater lipsiensis). The reconstruction of the University Library, which was heavily damaged during the war and in the [[East Germany|GDR]] barely secured, was completed in 2002.
In 2008 the university was able to prevail in the nationwide &quot;Initiative of Excellence&quot; of Germany and it was granted the graduate school &quot;[[BuildMoNa]]: Leipzig School of Natural Sciences – Building with Molecules and Nano-objects&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buildmona.de Graduate School BuildMoNa]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the university was able to receive grants from the Saxon excellence initiative for the &quot;Life&quot; project – a project that tries to explore common diseases more effectively. Also in 2008 the [[Bach-Archiv Leipzig|&quot;Bach Archive&quot;]] was associated with the university.
With the delivery of the [[City-Hochhaus Leipzig|University Tower]] to a private user, the university was forced spread some faculties over several locations in the city. Furthermore it redesigned its historical centre at the [[Augustusplatz]]. This action was highly controversial. In 2002 Behet Bonzio received the second prize in the architectural competition. A first prize was not awarded by the jury. A lobby with partial support of the provincial government called for the rebuilding of [[Paulinerkirche, Leipzig|St. Paul's Church]] and [[Augusteum (Leipzig)|Augusteum]]. This caused the resistance of the university leadership, the majority of the students and population of Leipzig. These disputes led to a scandal in early 2003, were the Rector Volker Bigl, and the pro-rectors resigned in protest against the government. This was further forced after severe tensions had built up because of the Saxon university treaty on the future funding of higher education. As a compromise they could agree on the implementation of a second competition, which only covered the [[Augustusplatz]] front of the university. On 24 March 2004, a jury chose the design by Dutch architect [[Erick van Egeraat]], which was well received by almost all sides. He recalls the outer form of the St. Paul's Church and Augusteum, and abstracted the original building complex. The renovations began in the summer of 2005.
In 2009 the University of Leipzig celebrates its 600th anniversary with over 300 scientific and cultural lectures and exhibitions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sechshundert.de/index1_e.php?JavaScript=On Universität Leipzig 600th Anniversary]&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the role of the university's research and teaching from the beginning until today in Germany and Europe.

=== Library ===
[[Image:BibliothecaAlbertina Leipzig.jpg|University library Bibliotheca Albertina.|thumb]]
The [[Leipzig University Library|University Library of Leipzig]] was established in 1543. It is one of the oldest German university libraries and it serves as a source of literature and information for the University of Leipzig as well as the general public in the region. Its extensive historical and special collections are nationally and internationally recognized. The library consists of the main building &quot;Bibliotheca Albertina&quot; and forty branches situated near their respective academic institutions. The current stock comprises 5 million volumes and about 7,700 periodicals. Collections range from important medieval and modern manuscripts to incunabula, papyri, autographs, ostraka and coins. The [[Apel Codex]], a manuscript of 16th century music, is currently housed in the [[Leipzig University]] library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Grove Concise Dictionary of Music|first=Stanley|last=Sadie|first2=Alison|last2=Latham|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
The university's urban campus comprises several locations. All in all, the university is spread across 38 locations in Leipzig. The university's buildings in the center of Leipzig underwent substantial reconstruction since 2005; the new university's main building being drafted by Dutch architect [[Erick van Egeraat]]. The estimated total cost for the renovation project is 140 million euro. The new buildings are going to be completed in 2009/2010, just in time for the university's 600th anniversary celebrations.

Besides the faculties and other teaching institutions, there are several other bodies that serve the university: the University Library, a university archive and administration, numerous museums (e.g. the [[Museum of Musical Instruments of the University of Leipzig|Museum for Music Instruments]] and the Museum of Ancient Egypt) and the university hospital. The university's [[Leipzig Botanical Garden]] was established in 1542 and it is the second oldest botanical garden in Europe. 
The University's Musical Instrument Museum includes one of the world's three surviving [[piano]]s built by [[Bartolomeo Cristofori]], the piano's inventor. Five other Cristofori instruments are included in the Museum's collections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mfm.uni-leipzig.de/_eng/dasmuseum/europ_Musical_Instruments.php?navid=16 Museum of Musical Instruments]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academics===
Today, the university has 14 faculties. With over 29,000 students, it is Saxony's second-largest university. There are now more than 150 institutes and the university offers 190 study programs leading to [[Bachelor's degree]]s, [[Master's degree]]s, [[Staatsexamen]], [[Diplom]]&lt;ref&gt;Since the adoption of the Bachelor's degree and Master's degree only three study programs leading to Diplom have remained: Maths, Mathematical economics and Protestant [[Christian Theology]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.s]] of which nearly all are [[tuition]]-free. Arguably, the Faculty of Medicine is the university's most renowned faculty.

The university offers a number of courses in English and other foreign languages and there are several programs allowing foreign students to study abroad at the university. Current exchange partner universities include the [[University of Arizona]], [[University of Oklahoma]], [[University of Houston]], [[University of Alberta]], [[Ohio University]] and [[University of Edinburgh]] among others. Traditionally contacts to universities in Eastern Europe and the Far East are strong as well, e.g. there are cooperations with leading institutions like [[Lomonosov University]] (Moscow) and [[Renmin University]] (Beijing).

There is a variety of International Master's programs: American Studies, Global Studies, SEPT&lt;ref&gt;SEPT, the international Program of the University of Leipzig for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise promotion and training http://www.sept.uni-leipzig.de/&lt;/ref&gt; (MBA in SME Promotion)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sept.uni-leipzig.de/MBA-Program.10.0.html SEPT – MBA program at glance]&lt;/ref&gt; and one Bachelor/Master's/Ph.D. program (International Physics Studies Program&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~intphys/ Homepage of the International Physics Studies Program at Leipzig]&lt;/ref&gt;) taught in English.

Erasmus Mundus Global Studies on the other hand, is an interdisciplinary, research-based Master offered by a consortium of four European universities: University of Leipzig, the [[London School of Economics]], [[University of Vienna]], and [[University of Wroclaw]]. Since 2008 the university is also home to one of Germany's few [[Confucius Institute]]s. The Institute is based on an agreement of June 2006 between the university administration and representatives of the Chinese Embassy to establish a Confucius Institute in cooperation with the [[Renmin University of China|Renmin University]] and the &quot;National Office for Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language&quot;.

'''West Germany''' ({{lang-de|Westdeutschland}}) is the common [[English language|English]] name for the '''Federal Republic of Germany''' or '''FRG''' ({{lang-de|Bundesrepublik Deutschland}}) in the period between its creation in May 1949 to [[German reunification]] on 3 October 1990.  

During this period, West Germany and the communist [[East Germany]] were divided by the [[Inner German border]]. After 1961, [[West-Berlin]] was physically separated from [[East-Berlin]] as well as from East Germany by the [[Berlin Wall]]. This situation ended when East Germany was dissolved and its five states joined the ten states of the Federal Republic of Germany along with the reunified city-state of [[Berlin]]. The enlarged Federal Republic of Germany with sixteen states (known simply as &quot;Germany&quot;) is thus the continuation of the pre-1990 Federal Republic of Germany.

The Federal Republic of Germany was established from eleven [[states of Germany|states]] formed in the three [[Allied occupation of Germany|Allied Zones of occupation]] held by the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] (the &quot;Western Zones&quot;). The city of [[Bonn, Germany|Bonn]] was its provisional capital city. The fourth Allied occupation zone (the East Zone, or ''Ostzone'') was held by the [[Soviet Union]]. The parts of this zone lying east of the [[Oder]]-[[Neisse]] were in fact annexed by the Soviet Union and communist Poland; the remaining central part around Berlin became the communist [[German Democratic Republic]] (abbreviated GDR; in German ''Deutsche Demokratische Republik'' or ''DDR'') with its ''de facto'' capital in [[East Berlin]]. As a result, West Germany had a territory about half the size of the interwar democratic [[Weimar Republic]].

At the onset of the [[Cold War]], Germany (and, indeed, Europe) was divided among the Western and Eastern blocs. Germany was ''[[de facto]]'' divided into two countries and two special territories, the [[Saar (protectorate)|Saarland]] and divided Berlin. The Federal Republic of Germany claimed an [[exclusive mandate]] for all of Germany, considering itself to be the democratically reorganised continuation of the [[German Reich]]. It took the line that the GDR was an illegally constituted state. The GDR did hold regular elections, but these were not free and fair; from the West German perspective the GDR was thus a puppet state of the Soviets and therefore illegitimate. 

Three southwestern states of West Germany merged to form [[Baden-Württemberg]] in 1952, and the Saarland joined the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957. In addition to the resulting ten states, [[West Berlin]] was considered an unofficial ''de facto'' 11th state.  While legally not part of the Federal Republic of Germany, as Berlin was under the control of the [[Allied Control Council]], West Berlin aligned itself politically with West Germany and was directly or indirectly represented in its federal institutions.

Relations with the [[Soviet bloc]] improved during the era of ‘Neue [[Ostpolitik]]’ around 1970, and West Germany began taking the line of &quot;two German states within one German nation&quot;, but formally maintained the exclusive mandate. It recognised the GDR as a ''[[de facto]]'' government within a single German nation that in turn was represented ''[[de jure]]'' by the West German state alone. East Germany, as before, recognised the existence of two German countries ''de jure'', and the West as both ''de facto'' and ''de jure'' foreign country. The Federal Republic and the GDR agreed that neither of them could speak in the name of the other one.

The foundation for the influential position held by Germany today was laid during the ''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]'' (economic miracle) of the 1950s when West Germany rose from the enormous destruction wrought by [[World War II]] to become the world's third largest economy. The first chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]], who remained in office until 1963, had worked for a full alignment with the West rather than neutrality. He not only secured a membership in [[NATO]] but was also a proponent of agreements that developed into the present-day [[European Union]]. When the [[G8|G6/G8]] was established in 1975, there was no question whether the Federal Republic of Germany would be a member as well.

With the [[collapse of communism]] in Central and Eastern Europe in 1989, symbolised by the opening of the [[Berlin Wall]], there was a rapid move towards [[German reunification]]. East Germany voted to dissolve itself and accede to the Federal Republic in 1990. Its five post-war states (''Länder'') were reconstituted along with the reunited Berlin, which ended its special status and formed an additional ''Land''. They formally joined the Federal Republic on 3 October 1990, raising the number of states from 10 to 16, ending the division of Germany. The expanded Federal Republic retained West Germany's political culture and continued its existing memberships in international organisations, as well as its Western foreign policy alignment and affiliation to Western alliances like the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]].

==Naming conventions==
{{Main|BRD (Germany)}}
The official name of West Germany, adopted in 1949 and unchanged since, is ''Bundesrepublik Deutschland'' (Federal Republic of Germany). Its abbreviation &quot;BRD&quot; (German) or &quot;FRG&quot; (English) was sometimes also used.

In East Germany usage the terms ''Westdeutschland'' (West[ern] Germany) or ''westdeutsche Bundesrepublik'' (West German Federal Republic) were preferred during the 1950s and 1960s. This changed especially once East Germany considered West Germans and West Berliners foreigners under its [[Constitution of East Germany#1968 constitution|second constitution]] in 1968 abandoning the idea of a single German nation formerly upheld in East and West Germany alike. Starting in East German [[Neues Deutschland]] the initialism ''BRD'' (FRG) for the ''Federal Republic of Germany'' prevailed beginning in the early 1970s, while East German official sources adopted that initialism as the standard expression in 1973, followed by the usage of respective native abbreviations in all of the [[Eastern Bloc]].  

In reaction to this move, in 1965 the [[Minister of Intra-German Relations|Federal Minister of All-German Affairs]] issued the ''Directives for the appellation of Germany'' recommending avoiding the initialism. On 31 May 1974 the heads of German federal and state governments recommended to always use the full name in official publications. From then on West German sources began to avoid the abbreviated form, except left-leaning sources who started to embrace it. In November 1979 the federal government informed the [[Bundestag]] that the West German public broadcasters [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] and [[ZDF]] had agreed to refuse to use the initialism.&lt;ref&gt;See in general: Stefan Schmidt, &quot;Die Diskussion um den Gebrauch der Abkürzung «BRD»&quot;, in: ''Aktueller Begriff'', Deutscher Bundestag – Wissenschaftliche Dienste (ed.), No. 71/09 (4 September 2009) [https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/analysen/2009/abkuerzung_brd.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The different usages were so ingrained that one could deduce a person's or source's political leaning from the name used for West Germany. 

Meanwhile the colloquial term &quot;West Germany&quot; or its equivalents were used in many other languages. &quot;Westdeutschland&quot; was also a widespread colloquial form used in German-speaking countries, usually without political overtones.

==History==

{{Main|History of Germany since 1945}}

After [[World War II]], leaders from the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[Soviet Union]] held the [[Yalta Conference]] where future arrangements with post-war Europe and actions to be made against Japan in the Pacific were negotiated. The conference came to the agreement to split Germany into [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|four occupation zones]]—the [[France|French]] Zone in the far west, the [[United Kingdom|British]] Zone in the northwest, the [[United States|American]] Zone in the south, and the [[USSR|Soviet]] Zone in the east. It then was not the intention to split Germany, only to designate zones of administration.

Former German areas east of the rivers [[Oder]] and [[Lusatian Neisse|Neisse]] were put under Polish administration, and millions of Germans were expelled from there, to be replaced by Poles. (With the [[Soviet Union]] likewise taking a big bite from eastern Poland and [[East Prussia]]) In 1946–1949, the first three zones were combined in steps. First the British and American zones were combined into the quasi-state of [[Bizone|Bizonia]], then only months afterward the French zone was included into [[Bizone|Trizonia]]. At the same time, new federal states (''Länder'') were formed in the Allied zones, replacing the pre-war states. 

In 1949, with the continuation and aggravation of the Cold War (witness the [[Berlin Airlift]] of 1948–49), the two German states that were originated in the Western Allied and the Soviet Zones became known internationally as West Germany and East Germany. Commonly known in English as [[East Germany]], the former [[Soviet Occupation Zone]], became the ''[[German Democratic Republic]]'' or ''GDR''. From 3 October 1990, after the reformation of the GDR's ''Länder'', the East German states [[German reunification|joined the Federal Republic]].

===NATO membership===
&lt;!--[[File:ParisAgreement1954.jpg|thumb|left|The Paris Agreements, signed on 23 October 1954, restored sovereignty to the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] (FRG), which became a full member of [[NATO]], and resulted in the creation of the [[Western European Union]] (WEU).]]--&gt;
[[File:Deutschland Bundeslaender 1957.png|thumb|left|West Germany (blue) and West Berlin (yellow), after accession of the Saarland in 1957, before the five ''Länder'' from the GDR and East Berlin joined in 1990]]
The Federal Republic of Germany, founded on 23 May 1949, was declared &quot;fully sovereign&quot; on 5 May 1955. The former occupying Western troops remained on the ground, now as part of the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), which West Germany joined on 9 May 1955, promising to rearm itself soon.

West Germany became a focus of the [[Cold War]] with its juxtaposition to East Germany, a member of the subsequently founded [[Warsaw Pact]]. The former capital, [[Berlin]], had been divided into four sectors, with the Western Allies joining their sectors to form [[West Berlin]], while the Soviets held [[East Berlin]]. West Berlin was completely surrounded by East German territory and had suffered a Soviet blockade in 1948–1949, which was overcome by the [[Berlin airlift]].

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F002449-0027, Bonn, Bundestag, Pariser Verträge, Adenauer.jpg|left|thumb|[[Konrad Adenauer]] in parliament, 1955]]
The outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in June 1950 led to U.S. calls to rearm West Germany to help defend [[Western Europe]] from the perceived [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] threat. Germany's partners in the [[Coal and Steel Community]] proposed to establish a [[European Defence Community]] (EDC), with an integrated army, navy and air force, composed of the armed forces of its member states. The West German military would be subject to complete EDC control, but the other EDC member states ([[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Netherlands]]) would cooperate in the EDC while maintaining independent control of their own armed forces.

Though the EDC treaty was signed (May 1952), it never entered into force. France's [[Gaullists]] rejected it on the grounds that it threatened national sovereignty, and when the [[French National Assembly]] refused to ratify it (August 1954), the treaty died. The French Gaullists and communists had killed the French government's proposal. Other means then had to be found to allow West German rearmament. In response, at the [[London and Paris Conferences]], the [[Brussels Treaty]] was modified to include West Germany, and to form the [[Western European Union]] (WEU). West Germany was to be permitted to rearm (an idea many Germans rejected), and have full sovereign control of its military, called the [[Bundeswehr]]. The WEU, however, would regulate the size of the armed forces permitted to each of its member states. Also, the German constitution prohibited any military action, except in case of an external attack against Germany or its allies (''Bündnisfall''). Also, Germans could reject military service on grounds of conscience, and serve for civil purposes instead.

The three Western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] retained occupation powers in Berlin and certain responsibilities for Germany as a whole. Under the new arrangements, the Allies stationed troops within West Germany for NATO defense, pursuant to stationing and status-of-forces agreements. With the exception of 55,000 French troops, Allied forces were under NATO's joint defense command. (France withdrew from the collective military command structure of NATO in 1966.)

===Reunification===
{{Main|German reunification}}
The official German reunification ceremony on 3 October 1990 was held at the [[Reichstag building]], including [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]], [[President of Germany|President]] [[Richard von Weizsäcker]], former Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] and many others. One day later, the parliament of the united Germany would assemble in an act of symbolism in the Reichstag building.

However, at that time, the role of Berlin had not yet been decided upon. Only after a fierce debate, considered by many as one of the most memorable sessions of [[parliament]], the [[Bundestag]] concluded on 20 June 1991, with quite a slim majority, that both government and parliament should move to [[Berlin]] from [[Bonn]].

==West German economic miracle==
The West German [[Wirtschaftswunder]] (English: &quot;economic miracle&quot;, coined by ''[[The Times]]'' of London in 1950), was partly due to the economic aid provided by the United States and the [[Marshall Plan]], but mainly due to the currency reform of 1948, which replaced the [[Reichsmark]] with the [[Deutsche Mark]] as legal tender, halting rampant inflation. The Allied dismantling of the West German coal and steel industry finally ended in 1950.

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F038788-0006, Wolfsburg, VW Autowerk, Käfer.jpg|thumb|[[Volkswagen Beetle]] – for many years the most successful car in the world – on the assembly line in Wolfsburg factory, 1973]]
In addition to the physical obstacles that had to be overcome for the German economic recovery (see the [[Morgenthau Plan]]) there were also intellectual challenges. The Allies confiscated intellectual privileges of huge value, such as all German [[patent]]s, both in Germany and abroad, and used them to strengthen their own industrial competitiveness by licensing them to Allied companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econlib.org/library/enc/GermanEconomicMiracle.html David R. Henderson, &quot;German Economic 'Miracle'&quot;, ''The Library of Economics and Liberty'' website].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.germany.info/relaunch/culture/history/marshall.html Susan Stern, &quot;Marshall Plan 1947–1997: A German View&quot;, ''Germany Info'' website].&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile some of the best German researchers were being put to work in the Soviet Union and in the U.S.

Contrary to popular belief, the Marshall Plan, which was extended to include the newly formed West Germany in 1949, was not the main force behind the Wirtschaftswunder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econlib.org/library/enc/GermanEconomicMiracle.html Henderson, op. cit.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.germany.info/relaunch/culture/history/marshall.html Stern, op. cit.]&lt;/ref&gt; Had that been the case, other countries such as Great Britain and France (which both received higher economic assistance from the plan than Germany) should have experienced the same phenomenon. In fact, the amount of monetary aid (which was in the form of loans) received by Germany through the Marshall Plan was far overshadowed by the amount the Germans had to pay back as war reparations and by the charges the Allies exacted from the Germans for the ongoing cost of occupation (about [[United States dollar|$]]2.4 billion per year). In 1953 it was decided that Germany was to repay $1.1 billion of the aid it had received. The last repayment was made in June 1971.

The [[Korean war]] (1950–1953) led to a worldwide increased demand for goods, and the resulting shortage helped overcome lingering resistance to the purchase of German products. At the time Germany had a large pool of skilled and cheap labour, partly as a result of the [[deportation]]s and [[Human migration|migration]]s, which affected up to 16.5 million Germans. This helped Germany to more than double the value of its exports during the war. Apart from these factors, hard work and long hours at full capacity among the population and in the late 1950s and 1960s extra labour supplied by thousands of ''[[Gastarbeiter]]'' (&quot;guest workers&quot;) provided a vital base for the economic upturn. This would have implications later on for successive German governments as they tried to assimilate this group of workers.&lt;ref&gt;[[David H Childs]] and Jeffrey Johnson, West Germany: Politics And Society, Croom Helm, 1982 [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PJUOAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=West+Germany+-+politics+and+society&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ga1ab-mhef&amp;sig=SQ_14UMa9GfjbECQA7pXF0RSe_Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eO7uSouhMof6-Abkt8juCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 1950s onwards, West Germany had one of the strongest economies in the world, almost as strong as before the Second World War. The East German economy showed a certain growth, but not as much as in West Germany, partly because of continued reparations to the USSR in terms of resources.

In 1952 West Germany became part of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which would later evolve into the [[European Union]]. On 5 May 1955 West Germany was declared &quot;fully sovereign&quot;. The [[British Armed Forces|British]], [[Military of France|French]] and [[Military of the United States|U.S. militaries]] remained in the country, just as the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] remained in East Germany. Four days after becoming &quot;fully sovereign&quot; in 1955, West Germany joined NATO. The U.S. retained an especially strong presence in West Germany, acting as a deterrent in case of a Soviet invasion. In 1976 West Germany became one of the founding nations of the [[G8|Group of Six]] (G6). In 1973, West Germany—home to roughly 1.26% of the world's population—featured the world's [[List of regions by past GDP (PPP)|fourth largest GDP]] of 944 billion (5.9% of the world total). In 1987 the FRG held a 7.4% share of total world production.

==Position towards East Germany==
{{See also|German reunification}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F031406-0017, Erfurt, Treffen Willy Brandt mit Willi Stoph.jpg|thumb|[[Willy Brandt]] and [[Willi Stoph]] in [[Erfurt]] 1970, the first time a Chancellor met a GDR prime minister]]
The official position of West Germany concerning East Germany was that the West German government was the only democratically elected and therefore the only legitimate representative of the German people. According to the [[Hallstein Doctrine]], any country (with the exception of the USSR) that recognised the authorities of the [[German Democratic Republic]] would not have diplomatic relations with West Germany. 

In the early 1970s, Willy Brandt's policy of &quot;Neue [[Ostpolitik]]&quot; led to a form of mutual recognition between East and West Germany. The [[Treaty of Moscow (1970)|Treaty of Moscow]] (August 1970), the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1970)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (December 1970), the [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin]] (September 1971), the [[Transit Agreement (1972)|Transit Agreement]] (May 1972), and the [[Basic Treaty, 1972|Basic Treaty]] (December 1972) helped to normalise relations between East and West Germany and led to both German states joining the [[United Nations]]. The Hallstein Doctrine was abolished.

The West German Constitution (''Grundgesetz''/&quot;Basic Law&quot;) provided two articles for the unification with other parts of Germany:
* Article 23 provided the possibility for other parts of Germany to join the Federal Republic (under the constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany).
* Article 146 provided the possibility for unification of all parts of Germany under a new constitution.

After the peaceful revolution of 1989 in East Germany, the first freely elected East German parliament decided in June 1990 that the ''Länder'' soon to be reestablished would join the Federal Republic under Article 23 of the (West) German Basic Law (''Grundgesetz''). This made a quick unification possible. In July/August 1990 the East German parliament enacted a law for the reestablishment of ''[[New federal states|Länder]]'' on the territory of the German Democratic Republic.

The two German states entered into a [[Monetary union|currency]] and [[customs union]] in July 1990, and on 3 October 1990, the [[German Democratic Republic]] dissolved and the then reestablished [[New federal states|five East German ''Länder'']] (as well as a unified Berlin) joined the Federal Republic of Germany, bringing an end to the East-West divide.

==Politics==
Political life in West Germany was remarkably stable and orderly. The [[Konrad Adenauer|Adenauer]] era (1949–63) was followed by a brief period under [[Ludwig Erhard]] (1963–66) who, in turn, was replaced by [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]] (1966–69). All governments between 1949 and 1966 were formed by the united caucus of the [[Christian-Democratic Union]] (CDU) and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] (CSU), either alone or in coalition with the smaller [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP) or other rightwing parties.

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F038505-0006, Bonn, Amtsantritt Kabinett Brandt bei Heinemann.jpg|thumb|The Brandt cabinet of 1969 on the steps of President Heinemanns's residence in Bonn, [[Villa Hammerschmidt]]]]

Kiesinger's 1966–69 &quot;Grand Coalition&quot; was between West Germany's two largest parties, the CDU/CSU and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD). This was important for the introduction of new emergency acts—the Grand Coalition gave the ruling parties the two-thirds majority of votes required to see them in. These controversial acts allowed basic constitutional rights such as freedom of movement to be limited in case of a [[state of emergency]].

Leading up to the passing of the laws, there was fierce opposition to them, above all by the FDP, the rising [[German student movement]], a group calling itself [[Notstand der Demokratie]] (&quot;Democracy in a State of Emergency&quot;) and the [[Trade union|labour unions]]. Demonstrations and protests grew in number, and in 1967 the student [[Benno Ohnesorg]] was shot in the head by a policeman. The press, especially the [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] ''[[Bild-Zeitung]]'' newspaper, launched a vast campaign against the protesters and in 1968, believed by some as a result, there was an attempted assassination of one of the top members of the German socialist students' union, [[Rudi Dutschke]].

By 1958 a stronger desire to confront the [[Nazism|Nazi]] past had come into being. In the 1960s [[environmentalism]] and [[anti-nationalism]] became fundamental values among left-wing Germans. As a result in 1979 [[Alliance '90/The Greens|the Greens]] were able to reach the 5% minimum required to obtain parliamentary seats in the [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]] state election, and with the foundation of the national party in 1980 developed into one of the most politically successful green movements in the world.

Another result of the unrest in the 1960s was the founding of the [[Red Army Faction]] (RAF). The RAF was active from 1968, carrying out a succession of terrorist attacks in West Germany during the 1970s. Even in the 1990s, attacks were still being committed under the name ''RAF''. The last action took place in 1993, and in 1998 the group announced it was ceasing activities.

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F073617-0004, Mainz, CDU-Bundesparteitag, Kohl.jpg|thumb|[[Helmut Kohl]] in 1986]]

In the 1969 election, the SPD gained enough votes to form a coalition government with the FDP. SPD leader and Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] remained head of government until May 1974, when he resigned after the [[Guillaume Affair]], in which a senior member of his staff was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service, the [[Stasi]]. However the affair is widely considered to have been merely a trigger for Brandt's resignation, not a fundamental cause. Instead, Brandt, dogged by scandal relating to serial adultery, and struggling with alcohol and depression&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bwbs.de/Beitraege/130.html Talk by Hans-Jochen Vogel] on 21 October 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregor Schöllgen: ''Willy Brandt. Die Biographie.'' Propyläen, Berlin 2001. ISBN 3549071426&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the economic fallout of the [[1973 oil crisis]], almost seems simply to have had enough. As Brandt himself later said, &quot;I was exhausted, for reasons which had nothing to do with the process going on at the time.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;quoted in: Gregor Schöllgen. [http://www.zeit.de/2003/40/P-Schreiber?page=all ''Der Kanzler und sein Spion.''] In: DIE ZEIT 2003, Vol. 40, 25 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; 

Finance Minister Helmut Schmidt (SPD) then formed a government, continuing the SPD-FDP coalition. He served as Chancellor from 1974 to 1982. Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a leading FDP official, was Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister in the same years. Schmidt, a strong supporter of the [[European Community]] (EC) and the Atlantic alliance, emphasized his commitment to &quot;the political unification of Europe in partnership with the USA&quot;.

The goals of SPD and FDP however drifted apart in the late 1970s and early 1980s. On October 1, 1982, the FDP joined forces with the CDU/CSU to elect CDU Chairman [[Helmut Kohl]] as Chancellor in a [[Constructive vote of no confidence|Constructive Vote of No Confidence]]. Following national elections in March 1983, Kohl emerged in firm control of both the government and the CDU. The CDU/CSU fell just short of an absolute majority, because of the entry into the Bundestag of the Greens, who received 5.6% of the vote.

In January 1987, the Kohl-Genscher government was returned to office, but the FDP and the Greens gained at the expense of the larger parties. The Social Democrats concluded that not only were the Greens unlikely to form a coalition, but also that such a coalition would be far from a majority. Neither condition changed until 1998.

==Culture==
===Culture in general===
In many aspects, German culture continued in spite of the dictatorship and wartime. Old and new forms coexisted next to each other, and the American influence, already strong in the 1920s, grew.

===Sport===

[[File:Stamp football WC 1974 deutsche bundespost.jpg|thumb|Postage stamps commemorating football's [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]] in West Germany]]
In the 20th century [[association football]] became the largest sport in Germany. The [[Germany national football team]], established in 1900, continued its tradition based in the Federal Republic of Germany, winning the [[1954 FIFA World Cup]] in a stunning upset dubbed the [[1954 FIFA World Cup Final|miracle of Bern]]. Earlier, the German team was not considered part of the international top. The [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] was held in West German cities and West Berlin. After having been beaten by their East German counterparts in the first round, the team of the [[German Football Association]] won the cup again, defeating the [[Netherlands]] 2–1 in the final. With the process of unification in full swing in the summer of 1990, the Germans won a third World Cup, with players that had been capped for East Germany not yet permitted to contribute. European championships have been won too, in 1972 and 1980. 

After both Olympic Games of 1936 had been held in Germany, [[Munich]] was selected to host the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]. These were also the first summer games in which the East Germans showed up with the separate flag and anthem of the GDR. Since the 1950s, [[Germany at the Olympics]] had been represented by a united team led by the pre-war German NOC officials as the IOC had denied East German demands for a separate team.

As in 1957, when the Saarland acceded, East German sport organisations ceased to exist in late 1990 as their subdivisions and their members joined their Western counterparts. Thus, the present German organisations and teams in football, Olympics and elsewhere are identical to those that had been informally called &quot;West German&quot; before 1991. The only differences were a larger membership and a different name used by some foreigners. These organisations and teams in turn mostly continued the traditions of those that represented Germany before the Second World War, and even the First World War, thus providing a century-old continuity despite political changes. On the other hand, the separate East German teams and organisations were founded in the 1950s; they were an episode lasting less than four decades, yet quite successful in that time.

===Literary scene===
Besides the interest in the older generation of writers, new authors emerged on the background of the experiences of war and after war period. [[Wolfgang Borchert]], a former soldier who died young in 1947, is one of the best known representants of the [[Trümmerliteratur]]. [[Heinrich Böll]] is considered an observer of the young Federal Republic from the 1950s to the 1970s, and caused some political controversies because of his increasingly critical view on society.

===Life in general===
[[File:Franz Skarbina Weihnachtsmarkt Berlin.jpg|thumb|Franz Skarbina: Weihnachtsmarkt in Berlin, 1892]]
During the 40 years of separation some divergence occurred in the cultural life of the two parts of the severed nation. Both West Germany and East Germany followed along traditional paths of the common German culture, but West Germany, being obviously more affected by influences from western Europe and [[North America]], became more [[Multiculturalism|cosmopolitan]]. Conversely, East Germany, while remaining more conservative than West Germany in its adherence to some aspects of the received tradition, was strongly moulded by the dictates of a [[state socialism|state socialist]] ideology of predominantly Soviet inspiration. On the non-political level, East Germany was also influenced by the Eastern Bloc's Slavic cultures that manifested in art, culinary scene, and sports. Nevertheless, young East Germans were also fascinated by Western and particularly American culture, which they had a degree of access to in a variety of ways, not least through West German television and radio, whose broadcasts reached many parts of the country.

For the majority of Germans in present-day Germany who lived in pre-reunification West Germany, there has been minimal change in daily life stemming from German reunification as the reunified country is essentially West Germany incorporating East Germany on a West German base. In contrast, for East Germans the scale of change has been sweeping in all aspects of life from that before ''[[die Wende]]''. Although movements like [[Ostalgia]] exist attempting to celebrate and preserve parts of the GDR culture, since reunification the former East Germany has been converging towards the western part of the country in most parts of daily life.

==Geographical distribution of government==
In West Germany, most of the political agencies and buildings were located in Bonn, while the [[DAX|German Stock Market]] was located in [[Frankfurt am Main]], which became the economic center. The judicial branch of both the German [[Federal Constitutional Court]] (Bundesverfassungsgericht) and the highest Court of Appeals, were located in [[Karlsruhe]].

The West German government was known to be much more [[Decentralization|decentralised]] than its [[state socialism|state socialist]] East German counterpart, the former being a [[federal state]] and the latter a [[Unitary state|unitary one]]. Whilst East Germany was divided into 15 administrative districts (''Bezirke''), which were merely local branches of the national government, West Germany was divided into states (''Länder'') with independently elected state parliaments and control of the [[Bundesrat]], the second legislative chamber of the Federal Government.

==Present geographical and political terminology==
Today, [[Northrhine-Westphalia]] is often considered to be [[western Germany]] in geographical terms. When distinguishing between former West Germany and former East Germany as parts of present-day unified Germany, it has become most common to refer to the ''Alte Bundesländer'' (old states) and the ''Neue Bundesländer'' (new states), although ''Westdeutschland'' and ''Ostdeutschland'' are still heard as well.

'''Achille Peretti''' (13 June 1911 &amp;ndash; 14 April 1983), was a [[France|French]] [[politician]].

Peretti was born in [[Ajaccio]]. A lawyer by profession, he was a member of the French resistance, and was in charge of security of [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s government in [[Algiers]].

After the war, Peretti pursued a business career. A member of the French parliament from 1958 to his death, he became chairman of the National Assembly in 1969 when [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]] was nominated as prime minister. After the right-wing coalition's narrow victory in the 1973 elections, he had to step down and was replaced by [[Edgar Faure]].

Peretti was the mayor of [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] from 1947 until his death. He was succeeded by [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] who had become his political protégé.

She has been married to [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], the [[President of France|President of the French Republic]], since February 2008; the couple has a daughter, Giulia, born in October 2011.

==Early life==
Carla Gilberta Bruni Tedeschi was born in [[Turin]], Italy, and is [[Beneficiary|heiress]] to the fortune created by the Italian tyre manufacturing company [[CEAT Limited|CEAT]], founded in the 1920s by her grandfather Virginio Bruni Tedeschi. The company was sold in the 1970s to [[Pirelli]] (the brand lives on via its former subsidiary in India, founded in 1958).&lt;ref name=&quot;liberation&quot;&gt;{{fr icon}} {{cite web

 |title=Bruni-Tedeschi, de la saga à la telenovela |work=Libération |language=French |date=4 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to France in 1975,&lt;ref name=&quot;vanity fair 2008&quot;/&gt; reportedly to escape the threat of kidnapping by the [[Red Brigades]], a [[Marxist-Leninist]] Revolutionary group active in Italy in the 1970s. Bruni grew up in France from age seven and attended boarding school in Switzerland. She went to Paris to study art and architecture, but left school at 19 to become a model.&lt;ref name=&quot;thefashioninsider&quot;/&gt;

She is legally the daughter of Italian [[concert pianist]] [[:fr:Marisa Borini|Marisa Borini]] and [[industrialist]] and [[classical composer]] [[:fr:Alberto Bruni Tedeschi|Alberto Bruni Tedeschi]]. However, in 2008 Bruni told ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' that her biological father is Italian-born, [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] grocery magnate Maurizio Remmert, a young classical guitarist who had a six-year affair with her mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanity fair 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/style/features/2008/09/bruni200809

She had a brother, Virginio Bruni Tedeschi (1959–4 July 2006), who died from complications of HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=&quot;virginio&quot;&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/3539784/Carla-Bruni-became-aids-ambassador-because-brother-died-from-disease.html Carla Bruni became Aids ambassador because brother died from disease] – ''Telegraph'', 1 Dec 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

From her biological father, she has a half-sister, Consuelo Remmert.&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [http://www.repubblica.it/2007/10/sezioni/persone/sarkozy-separazione/padre-carla/padre-carla.html Il padre naturale di Carla Bruni « Vi racconto il legame con mia figlia »] – ''[[La Repubblica]]'', 9 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1987–1996: early career and modeling===
Bruni signed with City Models at age 19.&lt;ref name=&quot;thefashioninsider&quot;/&gt; [[Paul Marciano]], president and creative director of [[Guess (clothing)|Guess?

Following months of speculation, in a television interview broadcast on 23 November 2009, Bruni revealed that she had accepted a role in a forthcoming [[Woody Allen]] film. She admitted her reasoning for embarking on the Paris production;  &quot;I'm not an actress at all. Perhaps I'll be completely hopeless but I can't miss an opportunity like this one. When I'm a grandmother I'd like to be able to say I made a film with Woody Allen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/nov/24/carla-bruni-woody-allen-film Carla Bruni accepts Woody Allen film proposal] The Guardian. 24 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/6653591/Johnny-Hallyday-following-Carla-Bruni-into-films.html Johnny Hallyday following Carla Bruni into films] The Telegraph. 25 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The film, ''[[Midnight in Paris]]'', was released in 2011; Bruni appeared as a guide at the [[Musée Rodin]], who discusses sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]] with the leading characters.

In September 2010, she contributed a cover of [[David Bowie]]'s &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; to the [[War Child (charity)|War Child]] charity record [[We Were So Turned On]] : a tribute to David Bowie ([[Manimal Vinyl]]). They also released the track as a split 7&quot; vinyl split with UK legends, [[Duran Duran]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://musiconvinyl.blogspot.com/2011/02/boys-keep-swinging-duran-duran-absolute.html Boys keep swinging – Duran Duran / Absolute beginners – Carla Bruni] – Music On Vinyl, 16 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian singer/songwriter [[Simone Cristicchi]]’s entry in the 2010 [[Festival della canzone italiana|San Remo Italian Song Festival]] was the song “Meno Male”, with the chorus lyrics of “Meno male che c’è Carla Bruni” (“Thank goodness for Carla Bruni”). The song supposedly mocks Bruni and her husband, but Cristicchi stated in an interview for Italian television weekly [[TV Sorrisi e Canzoni]] that the song is about “our way of being Italian, [we are] always ready to follow any type of gossip and are disinterested in real problems”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sorrisi.com/2010/02/10/simone-cristicchi-secondo-me-son-tutti-matti/ Simone Cristicchi – Secondo me son tutti matti] TV Sorrisi e Canzoni. 10 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Bruni was to be a guest singer at the 2010 San Remo festival but withdrew from participating, purportedly because she was offended by Cristicchi’s song.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/7136849/Carla-Bruni-withdraws-from-festival-over-Sarkozy-song.html Carla Bruni withdraws from festival 'over Sarkozy song'] The Telegraph. 2 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
=== Marriage to Nicolas Sarkozy ===
[[File:Michelle obama and carla bruni sarkozy.jpg|left|thumb|Carla Bruni with [[Michelle Obama]]]]
Bruni met the recently divorced French president Nicolas Sarkozy in November 2007 at a dinner party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jan/13/france.alexduvalsmith France begins to grow weary with the Sarkozy soap opera] – [[The Guardian]], 13 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief romance they married on 2 February 2008 at the [[Élysée Palace]] in Paris. The marriage is Bruni's first and Sarkozy's third.  Bruni obtained French nationality not long afterwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lefigaro&quot;/&gt; She has since made contradictory statements as to whether she still holds Italian nationality as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marianne2.fr/Carla-Bruni-Sarkozy-son-pays,-elle-l-aime-mais-elle-le-quitte!_a174453.html Carla Bruni Sarkozy: son pays, elle l'aime... mais elle le quitte!] – [[Marianne (magazine)|Marianne]] 17 January 2009 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following her marriage to Sarkozy, in February 2008, Bruni continued accompanying him on state visits, including to the United Kingdom in March 2008, which created a sensation in the international press and the public in the UK and France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/7316345.stm BBC News In Pictures – Carla Bruni-Sarkozy] – [[BBC News]], 27 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; She has an office and staff at her disposal in the East wing of the [[Élysée Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualites/2008/04/03/01001-20080403ARTFIG00405-confidentiel-carla-prend-ses-quartiers-a-l-elysee.php Confidentiel : Carla prend ses quartiers à l'Élysée] – [[Le Figaro]], 3 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

There was controversy on the eve of the state visit to the UK, with the publication by Christie's auction house of a nude photograph of Bruni taken during her career as a model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-544832/Think-THIS-image-Carla-racy-You-ones-I-didnt-publish-says-photographer.html ''Think THIS image of Carla is racy?

The couple was awarded damages by a French court&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1577810/Carla-Bruni-awarded-damages-from-Ryanair.html ''Carla Bruni awarded damages from Ryanair''] – Telegraph, 7 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; which they donated to ''[[Restaurants du Cœur|Les Restos du Cœur]]'', an organisation which provides meals to the homeless.

In December 2008, Bruni sued the makers of a bag featuring a nude shot of the French first lady taken during her supermodelling youth. Clothes designer Pardon has produced 10,000 of the shopping bags emblazoned with the nude photo taken in 1993, showing Bruni staring at the camera with her crossed hands covering her crotch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pardon&quot;&gt;[http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG3724281/French-first-lady-Carla-Bruni-Sarkozy-sues-bag-makers-Pardon-over-nude-image.html French first lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy sues bag makers Pardon over nude image] – [[The Daily Telegraph]], 12 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 October 2011, Carla Bruni gave birth to a baby girl, Giulia, in the ''Clinique de la Muette'', in [[Paris]].

It has been claimed that Bruni has been involved with [[Louis Bertignac]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Léos Carax]], [[Charles Berling]], Arno Klarsfeld, [[Vincent Perez]]&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.gala.fr/l_actu/on_ne_parle_que_de_ca/carla_bruni_91828 ON NE PARLE QUE DE ÇA | CARLA BRUNI] – Gala&lt;/ref&gt; and former French Prime Minister [[Laurent Fabius]].&lt;ref name=time&gt;''[[Time Magazine]]'', vol. 170, n. 26/27, 31 December 2007 – 7 January 2008.

===The Enthovens===
While living with Jean-Paul Enthoven, Bruni fell in love and started an affair with his son, philosophy professor [[Raphaël Enthoven]] (the song &quot;Raphäel&quot; from Bruni's album ''[[Quelqu'un m'a dit]]'' is named after him), who was at the time married to novelist [[Justine Lévy]], daughter of philosopher [[Bernard-Henri Lévy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.gala.fr/l_actu/on_ne_parle_que_de_ca/quand_carla_bruni_brisait_les_coeurs_91867 When Carla Bruni broke hearts] – Gala, Eliane Georges , 17 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Bruni later denied ever having an affair with Raphaël's father in an interview published in [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]], &quot;I never slept with him, not even a minute.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vanity fair 2008&quot;/&gt;

The affair and the end of her marriage inspired Justine's 2004 book ''Rien de Grave'' (published in English in 2005 as ''Nothing Serious'').&lt;ref&gt;John Follain, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article3087304.ece Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni: Coup de foudre], Times Online, 23 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruni and Raphaël had a son, Aurélien, in 2001. Bruni told ''Vanity Fair'' that the couple broke up in May 2007 because Raphaël thought their relationship did not have a commitment.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanity fair 2008&quot;/&gt;

==Background==
Cecilia Attias was born '''Cécilia María Sara Isabel Ciganer-Albéniz'''. Her elderly father, André Ciganer (born Aron Chouganov) was a Moldovan Jewish immigrant born in [[Bălţi]], [[Bessarabia]] in 1898 of [[Russians|Russian]] and [[Romanians|Romanian]] Jewish lineage, she believed that he was of [[Romani people|Roma]] origin, because of the &quot;Ciganer&quot; surname; however it was later revealed that he was not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/oct/24/france.angeliquechrisafis|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|author=Chrisafis, Angelique|title=The Sarkozys' News|date=24 October 2007|accessdate=2007-12-15 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/united-states/news/article.cfm?l_id=110&amp;objectid=10653900|publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|author=Verena Dobnik|title=Former first lady back in limelight after fresh start|accessdate=2010-06-24|deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left home at the age of 13, just before the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;indie&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2695281.ece| title=Cécilia Sarkozy: The First Lady vanishes |publisher=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2007-06-24|date=19 October 2007 | location=London |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=December 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ciganer moved to Paris, where he became a [[furrier]].&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=SNKICWL0BRPGRQFIQMGCFFWAVCBQUIV0?xml=/news/2005/08/28/wsark28.xml|title=The photographer, the minister, his wife and her 'lover'|author=Day, Elizabeth; Samuel, Henry|date=27 August 2005|accessdate=2007-10-19 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 he married [[Spaniards|Spanish]]-[[Belgians|Belgian]] Diane Albéniz de Swert,&lt;ref name=&quot;indie&quot; /&gt; a daughter of Alfonso Albéniz Jordana, a Spanish diplomat who played with [[Real Madrid]] in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genealogia.netopia.pt/pessoas/pes_show.php?id=595817|publisher=GeneALL.net|title=Genealogy|accessdate=2007-10-19| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929091553/http://genealogia.netopia.pt/pessoas/pes_show.php?id=595817| archivedate = September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realmadrid.com/articulo/rma37492.htm|title=Pre-history and first official title (1900-1910)|accessdate=2007-10-19|publisher=[[Real Madrid C.F.]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071013011406/http://www.realmadrid.com/articulo/rma37492.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her maternal great-grandfather was the Spanish composer [[Isaac Albéniz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Buck, Joan Juliet 2007, page 180&quot;&gt;Buck, Joan Juliet, &quot;Political Heartache&quot;, ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', December 2007, page 180&lt;/ref&gt;

*Ivan Antoine Ciganer-Albéniz

Born with a heart defect, she suffered from cardiac problems which hampered her growth. She underwent open [[cardiac surgery]] when she was 13, and she made up quickly for her growth delay. She stands 1.78 m (5' 10&quot;) tall.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailymail1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[The Daily Mail]]|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/femail/article.html?in_article_id=455411&amp;in_page_id=1879|title=Is Nicolas Sarkozy's wife his femme fatale?|author=Jones, David|date=18 May 2007|accessdate=2007-10-19 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She studied piano (first prize in piano at [[Conservatoire de Paris|Conservatoire]]), and obtained a baccalauréat B, after studying for 13 years in a French religious institution, Sœurs de Lübeck. She studied law in [[University of Paris II: Panthéon-Assas|Assas]]. She went on to become a parliamentary assistant to [[René Touzet (French politician)|René Touzet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcnews1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[BBC]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6656717.stm|title=Sarkozy soap opera grips Paris|date=15 May 2007|author=Wyatt, Caroline|accessdate=2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also was a fitting model for [[Elsa Schiaparelli|Schiaparelli]], the French fashion house, and worked for a public-relations company.&lt;ref name=&quot;indie&quot; /&gt;

==Private life==
Cécilia Ciganer-Albéniz moved in with the popular French TV host [[Jacques Martin (TV host)|Jacques Martin]] in 1983. They married on 10 August 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;indie&quot; /&gt; The wedding took place in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] at the town hall, and [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], then the mayor of Neuilly, conducted the wedding. The Martins had two daughters, Judith Martin (b. August 22, 1984) and Jeanne-Marie Martin (b. June 8, 1987). She has a grandson, Augustin and a granddaughter Diane Elizabeth, born of her daughter Jeanne-Marie.

Nicolas Sarkozy, who was married to his first wife at the time, met his future wife again three years later and has said he felt &quot;struck by lightning&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcnews1&quot; /&gt; Other sources, however, state that Sarkozy fell in love with the bride on her wedding day. In any case, Cécilia Martin would leave her husband to live with Sarkozy in 1988 and obtained a divorce three months later. Once Sarkozy had himself obtained a divorce in 1996, they married in Neuilly on October 23, 1996. The witnesses were [[Martin Bouygues]] and billionaire businessman [[Bernard Arnault]]. Six months later, on April 23, 1997, Cécilia Sarkozy gave birth to the couple's only child, Louis. Nicolas Sarkozy has two sons from his first marriage.

Nicolas Sarkozy once declared that his now-former wife was his &quot;strength and [his] [[Achilles' heel]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/05/28/sarkozy/|title=Sarkozy and his model wife|publisher=[[Salon.com]]|accessdate=2007-10-19|author=Simons, Stefan|date=May 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicolas Sarkozy wrote in his 2005 book, ''Testimony'', &quot;Today, Cécilia and I are reunited for good, for real, doubtless for ever ... [W]e are not able and do not know how to separate from each other.&quot; He has said his wife is his &quot;true soulmate&quot; and &quot;the person without whom nothing I do would be possible&quot;. In July 2007, he said, &quot;At the end of the day, my only real worry is Cécilia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Yahoo!]] News|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070812/ts_afp/franceuspolitics_070812182707;_ylt=AkdUvD7qTPQ4YAeZXI33i6.tOrgF|title=Bucking convention, French first lady snubs Bush invite|accessdate=2007-10-19}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political life==
When her husband was a Minister, Cécilia Sarkozy had an office next to his, serving as his close adviser.

Cécilia Sarkozy visited [[Libya]] twice in July 2007 to visit [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] and helped in securing the release of [[HIV trial in Libya|five Bulgarian nurses and one Palestinian doctor]] who had all spent years on [[Libya]]'s death row after allegedly being tortured into confessing to infecting Libyan babies with the [[HIV]] virus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6896305.stm &quot;Sarkozy's wife visits HIV medics&quot;] ''[[BBC]]'', 13 July 2007 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[French left]] asked for Cécilia Sarkozy to be heard by the Parliamentary Commission expected to be created in October 2007 concerning the terms of the release of the six, as she had played an &quot;important role&quot; in their liberation according to [[Pierre Moscovici]] ([[French Socialist Party|PS]]).&lt;ref name=Liberation_Cecilia&gt;&quot;[http://www.liberation.fr/actualite/politiques/272294.FR.php France-Libye: la gauche réclame des explications à Cécilia Sarkozy]&quot;, in ''[[Libération]]'' (with [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]), 14 August 2007 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divorce==
In October 2007, several French, American, and British media outlets published rumors that the Sarkozys had separated and expected to announce their plans to divorce shortly.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Journal 20 minutes du 15 octobre 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/10/17/europe/sarkozy.php Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife, Cécilia, are filing for divorce, French media reports - International Herald Tribune&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1672040,00.html | work=Time | title=The Sarkozy Soap Opera | date=2007-10-16 | accessdate=2010-04-28 | first=Vivienne | last=Walt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Associated Press]]'' and CNN.com reported on October 18, 2007, that a divorce announcement was imminent. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported  that same day that the Élysée Palace had released a statement declaring that the Sarkozys “announce their separation by mutual consent.” Shortly afterwards, the palace corrected the separation announcement by stating that the Sarkozys had actually officially divorced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/world/europe/19france.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | title=Sarkozy Faces Labor and Marital Crises | first=Elaine | last=Sciolino | date=2007-10-19 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 October 2007, an interview with Cécilia Sarkozy was published on the front page of ''[[L'Est Républicain]]'', a regional French newspaper. In it, she admitted that she had run away with her lover, Richard Attias, in 2005 (&quot;I met someone, I fell in love, I left&quot;) and that though she eventually returned to Sarkozy, they were unable to repair their marriage. &quot;What happened to me has happened to millions of people: one day you no longer have your place in the couple. The couple is no longer the essential thing of your life. It no longer functions; it no longer works.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/world/europe/20france.html?hp | work=The New York Times | title=France's Former First Lady Admits Affair and Says Life in Public Eye Isn't for Her | first=Elaine | last=Sciolino | date=2007-10-20 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Andorra}}

The '''Co-Princes of Andorra''' are the two rulers of the [[Andorra|Principality of Andorra]], a tiny landlocked nation lying in the [[Pyrenees]] mountains between [[France]] and [[Spain]].  Founded in 1278 through a treaty between the Spanish [[Bishop of Urgell]] and the French [[Count of Foix]], this unique monarchial arrangement has persisted through medieval times to the present day.  Currently, the Bishop of Urgell and the [[President of France]] serve as Andorra's co-princes, following the transfer of the Count of Foix's claims to the [[King of France|Crown of France]], and thence to the [[French Republic]].  

The Andorran [[principality]] has the unique distinction of being ruled by two non-Andorran sovereigns, one of whom (the French president) is the only [[monarch]] in the world to be elected by the people&amp;mdash;though not by the people of Andorra, but rather those of France.  He is also the only monarch to be the head of state of a [[republic]] at the same time.

==Origin and development of the co-principality==
Tradition holds that [[Charlemagne]] granted a charter to the Andorran people in return for their fighting against the [[Moors]].  The [[Feudalism|feudal overlord]] of this territory was at first the [[Count of Urgell]]; however in 988 the count, Borrell II, gave Andorra to the [[Diocese of Urgell]] in exchange for land in [[Cerdanya]].&lt;ref name=&quot;histo1&quot;&gt;{{Cite GREC|title=La formació d'Andorra|NDCHEC=0003864|en=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bishop of Urgell, based in [[la Seu d'Urgell|Seu d'Urgell]], has ruled Andorra ever since.&lt;ref name=elements&gt;[http://www.coprince-fr.ad/catala/elements.htm Things about the history of Andorra] French Co-prince {{ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{dead link|date=June 2011}}

Before 1095, Andorra did not have any type of military protection and since the Bishop of Urgell knew that the Count of Urgell wanted to reclaim the Andorran valleys,&lt;ref name=elements/&gt; he asked for help from the Lord of Caboet. In 1095, the Lord and the Bishop signed a declaration of their co-sovereignty over Andorra. Arnalda, daughter of Arnau of Caboet, married the Viscount of Castellbò and both became Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya. Their daughter, Ermessenda,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite GREC|title=Ermessenda de Castellbò|NDCHEC=0024413|en=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; married Roger Bernat II, the [[France|French]] [[Count of Foix]]. They became Roger Bernat II and Ermessenda I, Counts of Foix, Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya, and also co-sovereigns of Andorra (together with the Bishop of Urgell).

In the 11th century, a dispute arose between the Bishop of Urgell and the Count of Foix. The conflict mediated by [[Aragon]] in 1278 and led to the signing of the first [[Paréage of Andorra 1278|paréage]], which provided that Andorra's sovereignty be shared between the count&lt;ref name=elements/&gt; and the bishop. This gave the [[principality]] its territory and political form, and marked the formal commencement of Andorra's unique monarchial arrangement.

Over the years, the French co-title to Andorra passed from the Count of Foix to the kings of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]. After King Henry III of Navarre became King [[Henry IV of France]], he issued an edict in 1607 establishing the [[King of France]] and the Bishop of Urgell as co-princes of Andorra. In 1812–13, the [[First French Empire]] annexed [[Catalonia]] and divided it into four [[département]]s, with Andorra forming part of the district of [[Puigcerdà]] (département of [[Sègre]]).  Following the defeat of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]], this annexation was reversed and Andorra reverted to its former independence and political state.  French rulers&amp;mdash;whether king, emperor or president&amp;mdash;would continue to serve as co-princes of Andorra to the present day.

==Recent history==
On July 12, 1934, Andorra's monarchial system was challenged by an adventurer named [[Boris Skossyreff]], who issued a proclamation in Urgel declaring himself &quot;Boris I, King of Andorra&quot;.  Though initially enjoying some support within Andorra's political establishment, he was ultimately arrested by Spanish authorities on July 20 of that year after declaring war on the Bishop of Urgell (who had refused to relinquish his own claim to the principality).  Skossyfreff was expelled, and was never considered to have been the Andorran monarch in any legal sense.

Prior to 1993, Andorra had no written [[constitution]], and the exact prerogatives of the co-princes were not specifically defined in law.  This changed in March of that year, when a [[Constitution of Andorra|constitution]] was approved by a vote of the Andorran people and signed into law by the two co-princes at the time: President [[François Mitterrand]] and Bishop [[Joan Martí Alanis]].  It clarified the continuance of the unique Andorran monarchy, and also delineated the precise role and prerogatives of the two princes.  Prior to adoption of the constitution, Andorra paid in odd-numbered years a tribute of approximately $460 to the French ruler, while on even-numbered years, it paid a tribute of approximately $12 to the Spanish bishop, plus six hams, six cheeses, and six live chickens, though this medieval custom was abandoned in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,912223,00.html Andorra: Septicentennial for a Ministate], from Time, October 30, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, French president Nicholas Sarkozy threatened to resign his title of Andorran co-prince if the principality did not change its banking laws to eliminate its longstanding status as a tax haven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/19/27862 Sarkozy threatens to renounce Andorran title].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary political role==
The Constitution of Andorra carefully defines the exact role and prerogatives of the co-princes of Andorra today.  The constitution establishes Andorra as a &quot;parliamentary coprincipat&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Andorra, 1:4.&lt;/ref&gt; providing for the President of France and Bishop of Urgell to serve together as the joint heads of state.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Andorra, 43:1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  The constitution distinguishes between which powers they may exercise on their own (Article 46), and which require the countersignature of the head of the Andorran government, or the approval of the Syndic General, the Andorran legislature (Article 45).

Powers the princes may exercise on their own include:&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Andorra, Article 46.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Joint exercise of the &quot;prerogative of grace&quot; (the power to pardon);
*Each co-prince may appoint one member of the Superior Council of Justice and one member of the Constitutional Tribunal;
*Establishment of such services as they deem necessary to fulfil their constitutional prerogatives, and appointment of individuals to fulfil these services;
*Requesting a preliminary judgment about the constitutionality of proposed laws, or of international treaties;
*Agreeing to the text of any international treaty, prior to submitting it for parliamentary approval;
*Bringing a case before the Constitutional Tribunal in the event of any conflict over the exercise of their constitutional prerogatives.

Powers the princes may exercize in conjunction with the head of government include:&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Andorra, Article 45.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Calling for elections or referendums in accordance with constitutional provisions;
*Appointing the head of government in accordance with constitutional provisions;
*Dissolve the General Council (the Andorran legislature) prior to the expiration of its current term (but not until at least one year has passed since the prior election);&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Andorra:45:1:E and 71:1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Accrediting diplomatic representatives from Andorra to foreign states, and receive credentials of foreign representatives to Andorra;
*Appointing office-holders in accordance with appropriate constitutional provisions;
*Sanctioning and enacting laws in accordance with constitutional provisions;
*Granting formal consent to international treaties, once ratified by the General Council.

Each prince is granted an annual allowance by the General Council, which they may dispose of as he or she sees fit.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Andorra, 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each appoints a personal representative in Andorra,&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Andorra, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the case of incapacitation of one of them, the constitution provides for the other prince to govern in his or her absence, with the concurrence of the Andorran head of government and/or the General Council.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Andorra, 45:3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain treaties require the participation of the co-princes (or their designated representatives) in their negotiation process as well as their final approval; these are detailed in Articles 66 and 67 of the constitution.  

The co-princes jointly retain the right to propose amendments to the constitution; this same right rests with the General Council.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Andorra, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;  They have no veto power over legislation passed by the General Council, though they do retain a veto over certain international treaties, as described above.

'''Daniel Vaillant''' (born 19 July 1949 in [[Lormes]], Nièvre) is a French [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] politician.

==Biography==
Close to [[Lionel Jospin]], Vaillant held several ministerial portfolios in his cabinets: Minister of the Relations with Parliament from 1997 to 2000 and [[Interior Minister (France)|Interior Minister]] from 2000 to 2002. He also supported Jospin as candidate for the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] in the [[French presidential election, 2007|2007 presidential election]];&lt;ref&gt;Paul Quinio, [http://www.liberation.fr/politiques/010951801-jospin-se-retire-de-sa-retraite-politique Jospin se retire de sa retraite politique], ''Libération'', 29 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; a candidacy which eventually did not materialize.

As of 2009, he is mayor for the 18th district of Paris (first election 1995) and a member of the [[Assemblée Nationale]].

In October 2009, he proposed to decriminalize the personal use of cannabis through control of production and import, as is the case with alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2009/10/09/daniel-vaillant-propose-une-legalisation-controlee-du-cannabis_1251565_3224.html Daniel Vaillant (PS) propose une légalisation contrôlée du cannabis], Le Monde, October 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of France}}
'''Dominique Marie François René Galouzeau de Villepin''' {{IPA-fr|dɔminik də vilpɛ̃|-|Fr-Dominique de Villepin.ogg}} (born 14 November 1953) is a French politician who served as the [[Prime Minister of France]] from 31 May 2005 to 17 May 2007.

A career diplomat, Villepin rose through the ranks of the French right as one of [[Jacques Chirac]]'s protégés. He came into the international spotlight as [[Foreign Minister (France)|Foreign Minister]] with his opposition to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] which culminated with a speech to the UN ([[s:French address on Iraq at the UN Security Council|French address on Iraq at the UN Security Council]]).

Villepin was indicted in connection with the [[Clearstream affair]],&lt;ref name=&quot;charged&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/07/27/europe/EU-GEN-France-Political-Scandal.php Villepin faces charges in smear campaign in France]&quot;, ''International Herald Tribune'', 27 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;De Villepin likely to face conspiracy charges&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=De Villepin likely to face conspiracy charges|date=6 July 2007|accessdate=6 July 2007|work=The Times |location=UK |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article2033979.ece  | first=Charles | last=Bremner}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was subsequently cleared of charges of complicity in allowing [[false accusations]] to proceed against presidential rival [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] regarding bribes paid on a sale of warships to [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{citation | title = France ex-PM Villepin cleared of Sarkozy smear | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8484728.stm | date = 28 January 2010 |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Villepin has enjoyed a modest return to public favour for his public critique of President Sarkozy's style of &quot;imperial rule.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Top politicians warn of 'Sarkozy the monarch'&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Top politicians warn of 'Sarkozy the monarch' | date=18 February 2008 | accessdate=18 February 2008 |work=The Independent |location=UK |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/europe/top-politicians-warn-of-sarkozy-the-monarch-783553.html  | first=John | last=Lichfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has written poetry, a book about poetry, and several historical and political essays, along with a study of Napoleon Bonaparte.

Villepin is an Honorary Member of the [[International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation]].

One of the most vocal right-wing opponents of President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], on 8 September, he announced his candidature for [[President of France]] in [[French presidential election 2012|2012]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Villepin consider a presidential run'&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title= Dominique de Villepin souhaite pouvoir être candidat en 2012'|date=24 April 2009|accessdate=24 April 2009|work=[[NouvelObs]]|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/depeches/politique/20090424.FAP8396/presidentielle_dominique_de_villepin_souhaite_pouvoir_e.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 March 2010, he announced that he would form a new center-right political movement in order to offer an alternative to Sarkozy in the 2012 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/7521419/Dominique-de-Villepin-launches-new-party.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London  | title=Dominique de Villepin launches new party with swipe at Nicolas Sarkozy Dominique de Villepin, France's former prime minister, has officially launched a new political movement with a swipe at the &quot;failure&quot; his arch-rival, Nicolas Sarkozy. | first=Henry | last=Samuel | date=25 March 2010 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new party, named ''[[United Republic (France)|République solidaire]]'', was formally launched on 18 June 2010 on the 70th anniversary of General de Gaulle's &quot;Appeal of 18 June&quot; in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703409804575143902882127976.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=De Villepin Plans New Party | first=David | last=Gauthier-Villars | date=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Villepin was born in [[Rabat, Morocco]] and spent some time in [[Venezuela]], where his family lived for four years. He graduated from the [[Lycée Français de New York]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lfnyalumni.org Lycée Français de New York Alumni Association]&lt;/ref&gt; He has three children: [[Marie de Villepin|Marie]] (b. 1986), Arthur, and Victoire (b. 1989).

Villepin's family derives from the middle class (the family was never aristocratic, and was responsible for adding the particle &quot;de&quot; to their own name).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/6752087/Nicolas-Sarkozy-has-the-last-laugh-on-aristocratic-rivals.html &quot;Nicolas Sarkozy has the last laugh on 'aristocratic' rivals&quot;] by Henry Samuel,''The Daily Telegraph'', 8 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; His great-grandfather was a [[colonel]] in the French army, his grandfather was a board member for several companies, and his father [[Xavier de Villepin]], now retired, was a diplomat and a member of the [[French Senate|Senate]]. Villepin speaks French, English and Spanish.

==Career==
===Diplomat===
Villepin studied at the [[Paris Institute of Political Studies|Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris]] (Sciences-Po) and went on to the [[École nationale d'administration]] (ENA), France's highly selective post-graduate school which trains its top civil servants. Villepin also holds degrees in Civil law and French literature from the universities of [[Paris II Panthéon-Assas]] and [[Paris X Nanterre]]. At the end of his studies he completed his military service as a naval officer on board the Aircraft Carrier Clemenceau, Villepin then entered a career in diplomacy. His assignments were:
*Advising Committee on African affairs (1980–1984)
*The French embassy in Washington, D.C. (1984–1989), as ''premier secrétaire'' until 1987 and then ''deuxième conseiller''
*The embassy in New Delhi (1989–1992), as ''deuxième conseiller'' until 1990 and then ''premier conseiller''
*Foreign Ministry's top adviser on Africa (1992–1993)

===Politician===
Villepin was introduced to Jacques Chirac in the early 1980s and became one of his advisers on foreign policy. In 1993 he became chief of staff (''directeur de cabinet'') of [[Alain Juppé]], the [[Foreign Minister (France)|Foreign Minister]] in [[Édouard Balladur]]'s cabinet, who was Chirac's political [[heir apparent]].

Villepin then became director of Chirac's successful 1995 presidential campaign and was rewarded with the key job of Secretary-General of the [[Élysée Palace]] during Chirac's first term as [[president of France|President of the Republic]] (1995–2002). He advised the president to hold an early general election in 1997, while the [[French National Assembly]] was overwhelmingly dominated by the president's party. This was a risky gamble, and Chirac's party went on to lose the elections. Villepin offered Chirac his resignation afterwards, but it was turned down. Villepin's flawed advice on the election increased the perception among many politicians on the right that Villepin had no experience or understanding of grassroots politics, and owed his enviable position only to being Chirac's protégé.

Villepin has had an uneasy relationship with the members of his own political side. He has in the past made a number of demeaning remarks on members of parliament from his own party. In addition, the mutual distaste between Villepin and [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], head of the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP) majority party, is well-known.

===Foreign Minister===
He was appointed Foreign Minister by Chirac in the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] at the beginning of Chirac's second term in 2002.

During the [[2004 Haitian coup d'état|2004 coup d'état]] in Haiti, Villepin obtained the backing of the [[United States Secretary of State]], [[Colin Powell]], in his bid to oust [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]] from power.

Villepin's most famous assignment as Chirac's Foreign Minister was opposing the U.S. plan to [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invade]] [[Iraq]], giving France a leading role in the grouping of countries such as Germany, Belgium, Russia and China that opposed the invasion. The speech&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignpolicy.org.tr/documents/villepin_140203_p.htm |title=Statement by Dominique de Villepin to the UNSC |publisher=Foreignpolicy.org.tr |date=14 February 2003 |accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; he gave to the UN to block a second resolution allowing the use of force against [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime received loud applause.

During mid-2003 Villepin organized the [[Opération 14 juillet]] that attepted to rescue his former student, [[Ingrid Betancourt]], who was being held by [[FARC]] rebels in Colombia. The operation failed, and because he had neither informed Colombia, Brazil, nor President Chirac of the mission, it resulted in a political scandal.

===Interior Minister===
During the cabinet reshuffle that made [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] [[Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industry (France)|Finance Minister]], Villepin was appointed to replace him as [[List of Interior Ministers of France|Interior Minister]] on 31 March 2004.

His actions against radical Islam included mandatory courses for Muslim clerics, notably in the French language (a third of them may not be fluent in the national language), in moderate Muslim theology and in French secularism: ''[[laïcité]]'', [[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|Republican principles]] and the law. While Sarkozy created the [[French Council of the Muslim Faith]], an official body which is now dominated by Orthodoxes, Villepin would have preferred a &quot;Muslim foundation&quot;, in which mosque-based representatives would be balanced by secular Muslims.

He also cracked down on radical Muslim clerics, causing an uproar when he tried to expel [[Abdelkader Bouziane]], an [[imam]] alleged to have said to the press that, according to Ancient Islamic texts, adulterous people could be whipped or [[stoning|stoned]]. When the decision to expel him was overturned by the courts, because of the journalistic reporting of LyonMag was deemed biaised, Villepin pushed a change of the law through Parliament, and Bouziane was sent home.

===Prime Minister===
President Chirac was at one point thought to have turned his eye on Villepin as a possible successor, assuming that he himself would not enter the 2007 presidential contest. However, Nicolas Sarkozy was chosen to represent the centre-right UMP party.

On 29 May 2005, French voters in the [[French referendum on the European Constitution|referendum]] on the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]] turned down the proposed document by a wide margin. Two days later, Raffarin resigned and Chirac appointed Villepin as [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]].

====''Contrat Première Embauche'' (First Employment Contract)====
{{Main|First Employment Contract}}
On Thursday, 16 March 2006, tens of thousands of French university and school students marched to demand the government scrap a contentious youth jobs clause, known as First Employment Contract (CPE). The law, intended as a response to the [[2005 civil unrest in France|2005 riots]], was intended to stimulate job growth and arrest the 23% youth unemployment rate by allowing employers to fire employees aged under 26 within the first two years of their employment for any or no reason. Supporters of the law argued that such probationary arrangements are not unusual in Western countries and that the current system in France discourages employers from hiring people whom they may be unable to fire if they prove unsuitable for the job. Critics argue that it discriminates unnecessarily against the young and decreases job security. The union movement issued an ultimatum to Villepin to scrap the law by 20 March or face a general strike. This ultimatum expired without concession. A general strike was called for 28 March.

====General strike, demonstrations, and the fall of Villepin====
On 28 March, between one and three million people demonstrated across France. The protests were accompanied by some violence and 800 people were arrested, 500 of them in Paris. Prime Minister Villepin refused to withdraw the CPE but called for negotiations on adapting it. The demonstrators for the most part called for the complete withdrawal of the CPE.

The CPE was withdrawn by Jacques Chirac on 10 April.&lt;ref name=&quot;NZHerald&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10377013 |title=French students set for jobs law 'victory march' |date=11 April 2006 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====More unrest for Villepin====
On 20 June 2006, during the questions to government in the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]], Dominique de Villepin accused head of the Socialist Party [[François Hollande]] of [[cowardice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/cri/2005-2006/20060247.asp |title=Assemblée nationale ~ Deuxième séance du mardi 20 juin 2006 |publisher=Assemblee-nationale.fr |accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hollande had questioned the Prime Minister about the recent &quot;[[insider trading]]&quot; scandal involving the aerospace company [[EADS]] and executive [[Noël Forgeard]]. This triggered an incident in the Assembly, with Socialist deputies converging on the government benches until they were stopped by the Assembly ushers. Hollande demanded apologies and the resignation of the Prime Minister;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/page.php?Article=391985 Libération – Toute l'actualité monde, politique, société, culture, débats... sur Liberation.fr]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the next day, Dominique de Villepin apologized. This event resulted in criticism even from Villepin's own [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] party, with UMP parliamentarians including Assembly vice-president [[Yves Bur]] suggesting that president [[Jacques Chirac|Chirac]] should appoint another Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=e-TF1 |url=http://tf1.lci.fr/infos/france/0,,3311088,00.html |title=Assemblée : Villepin présente ses excuses à Hollande – France – LCI |publisher=Tf1.lci.fr |accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Clearstream affair====
In 2004, French judges were given a list by an anonymous source containing the names of politicians and others who, it was alleged, had deposited kickbacks from a 1991 arms sale to Taiwan into secret accounts at Clearstream, a private bank in Luxembourg. The most prominent name on the list was that of Nicolas Sarkozy, Villepin's rival for power in the UMP. The list was later shown to be fraudulent, a discovery Villepin kept from the public for 15 months at a time when the two men were vying for party supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/france/story/0,,2123207,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London  | title=De Villepin could face charges over smear plot against Sarkozy | first=Angelique | last=Chrisafis | date=11 July 2007 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the source of the list was later revealed to be a longtime associate of Villepin's, one Jean-Louis Gergorin, an executive at EADS. Critics claimed that Villepin, perhaps with the support of then-president Jacques Chirac, had tried to defame his rival. Sarkozy, in turn, filed a suit against whoever was behind the creation of the Clearstream list. An investigation continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/05/22/world/main1640276.shtml | work=CBS News | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=November 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidential bid===
There was speculation that Villepin might be a candidate in the [[French presidential election, 2007|2007 Presidential election]]; however, interior minister [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] was selected unopposed as the UMP's presidential candidate on 14 January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6260275.stm |work=BBC News   | title=Sarkozy nod for presidential run | date=14 January 2007 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 March 2007 Villepin formally endorsed Sarkozy for President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/13/world/europe/13france.html | work=The New York Times | title=French Premier Throws Support for Presidency to Political Rival | first=Elaine | last=Sciolino | date=13 March 2007 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Villepin's first cabinet===
In an address to the nation, Chirac had declared that the new cabinet's top priority would be to curb unemployment, which was consistently hovering above 10%, calling for a &quot;national mobilization&quot; to that effect.

Villepin's cabinet was marked by its small membership (for France), and its hierarchical unity: all members had the rank of Minister, and there were no Secretaries of State, the lowest cabinet member rank. The aim of this decision was for the cabinet to form a close-knit and more efficient team to combat unemployment.

The economy was growing sluggishly and a significant drop in unemployment was yet to be seen. Villepin's aim was therefore to restore the French people's trust in their government, an achievement for which he publicly set himself a deadline of a hundred days from the appointment of cabinet.

Another issue was the [[European Constitution]], rejected by France and the Netherlands in referenda.

Some had speculated that Villepin, with his diplomatic experience and the prestige associated with the job of Prime Minister, would negotiate a new treaty with the [[European Union]], while Sarkozy would run the country at home. However, Villepin obtained favorable reviews from the press and temporarily increased popularity in polls. In particular, he was increasingly cited as a possible [[French presidential election, 2007|presidential candidate for 2007]], although Nicolas Sarkozy had publicly stated that he himself was giving considerable attention to that election. Villepin and Sarkozy initially avoided any open division.

Villepin declared that lowering unemployment was the number one objective of his government (which had also been stated by other prime ministers before him, albeit to no avail). He, as well as the UMP party, believed that France's workforce rules were too rigid and discouraged employment, and that some liberalizing reforms were necessary in order to &quot;correct&quot; the French social model.

On 2 August 2005 he issued [[Ordonnance (French constitutional law)|ordinances]] establishing a new kind of work contract (called ''CNE'') for small enterprises, with fewer guarantees than ordinary contracts. While Villepin's measures would surely have been approved by his wide UMP majority in Parliament. Villepin said the government needed to act fast, especially when Parliament was going on its summer recess.

On 16 January 2006 he announced a similar kind of work contract (called ''[[Contrat première embauche]]'', or ''CPE'') for young people (under 26). The parliament approved on 8 February. Subsequently students started to [[2006 labor protests in France|protest]]. This wave of protest eventually forced the government to give in. Although the law on the ''CPE'' is formally still valid, the government promised to hinder its application and initiated a new legal initiative which will abolish the key points of the ''CPE''. During the protests, Villepin was widely perceived as stubborn and arrogant. As a consequence, his popularity rates went down rapidly and he was no longer regarded as a serious contender for the 2007 presidential election.

Another major issue in Villepin's government was the state of the national budget. France runs high deficits, which run afoul of the rules set in the EU [[Maastricht Treaty]]. Villepin's margin of maneuver in that respect was extremely slim.

===Resignation===
On 15 May 2007, the last full day of President [[Jacques Chirac]]'s term, Villepin tendered his resignation from the office of Prime Minister and it was accepted by the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais/salle_de_presse/communiques_de_la_presidence/2007/mai/demission_du_gouvernement_communique.76618.html |title=Démission du gouvernement: communiqué. – Présidence de la République |publisher=Elysee.fr |date=21 December 2009 |accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced two days later by [[François Fillon]].

==Post Prime Ministerial career==
===Context of Villepin's political career===
Villepin has never held elected office; the [[Constitution of France|French Constitution]] allows the president to appoint unelected ministers. This is a political liability for him, because he is periodically accused of being out of touch with the realities of ordinary citizens. He is also reported to despise elected officials, calling members of Parliament ''connards'' (an insult).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/page.php?Article=369569 Libération – Toute l'actualité monde, politique, société, culture, débats... sur Liberation.fr]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Villepin is not the first &quot;unelected&quot; prime minister, even in the relatively short history of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]]: notable predecessors include [[Georges Pompidou]], who was a banker before being called to office, and [[Raymond Barre]], who had a previous career as a professor and appointed official, and started an elected career only after being Prime minister.

===Clearstream trial===
On the first day of the civil trial for his part in the Clearstream Affair, Villepin accused Pres. Sarkozy of pursuing him for political reasons. Sarkozy has the status of a civil plaintiff in the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alalam.ir/english/detail.aspx?id=80490 &quot;Villepin Rejects Sarkozy Slander Charges&quot;]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Thursday, 28 January 2010 the judgement was finally handed down and Villepin was acquitted of every accusation against him in the affair.
The following morning the prosecution announced that it would file an appeal against this verdict, thus further dragging out the affair another year. Villepin was finally cleared by an Appeals Court in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2011/0915/1224304142392.html &quot;Appeals court clears de Villepin of smear charges'']
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== République Solidaire and Presidential Run===
In 2011, Villepin quit the UMP and set up a new party, [[United Republic (France)|République Solidaire]] and is considering running for president in the 2012 elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Guardian |location=UK |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/14/sarkozy-villepin-manifesto-president-2012|title= Sarkozy's arch-enemy Villepin outlines his political manifesto|date=14 April 2011|author=Angelique Chrisafis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Édouard Balladur''' ({{IPA-fr|edwaʁ baladyʁ}}; born 2 May 1929) is a French politician who served as [[Prime Minister of France]] from 29 March 1993 to 10 May 1995.

==Biography==
Balladur was born in [[İzmir]], Turkey, to an [[Armenians|Armenia]]n Catholic family with five children and long-standing ties to France. His family emigrated to [[Marseille]] in 1935.

In 1957, Balladur married Marie-Josèphe Delacour, with whom he had four sons.

Balladur started his political career in 1964 as an advisor to Prime Minister [[Georges Pompidou]]. After Pompidou's election as [[President of France]] in 1969, Balladur was appointed under-secretary general of the presidency then secretary general from 1973 to Georges Pompidou's death in 1974.

He returned to politics in the 1980s as a supporter of [[Jacques Chirac]]. A member of the Neo-Gaullist [[Gaullist Party|Rally for the Republic]] (RPR) party, he was the theoretician behind the &quot;[[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation government]]&quot; from 1986 to 1988, explaining that if the right won the legislative election, it could govern with Chirac as Prime Minister without [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] President [[François Mitterrand]]'s resignation. As [[Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industry (France)|Minister of Economy and Finance]], he sold off a large number of public companies and abolished the wealth tax. He appeared as an unofficial deputy Prime Minister in the cabinet led by Chirac. He took a major part in the adoption of liberal and pro-European policies by Chirac and the RPR. After Chirac's defeat at the [[French presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]], a part of the RPR held him responsible of the abandonment of [[Gaullism|Gaullist doctrine]] but he kept the confidence of Chirac.

===Prime Minister===
When the RPR/[[Union for French Democracy|UDF]] coalition won the [[French legislative election, 1993|1993 legislative election]], Chirac declined to become Prime Minister again in a second &quot;cohabitation&quot; with President Mitterrand, and Balladur became Prime Minister. He was faced with a difficult economic situation but he did not want to make the political errors of the previous cohabitation government. If he failed to impose his project of minimum income for youth, he led a moderate liberal policy in economy.&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, Mairi: Privatisation in France 1993–94: new departures, or a case of plus ca change? – In: West European Politics (London), 18 (April 1995) 2, S. 273 290&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- not sure about the meaning of the previous sentence --&gt; Conveying the image of a quiet conservative, he did not question the [[wealth tax]] (reestablished by the Socialists in 1988). Despite corruption affairs affecting some of his ministers, who he forced to resign (thus lending his name to the so-called &quot;[[Balladur jurisprudence]]&quot;), he became very popular and had the support of influential media.

===1995 Presidential Election===
When he became Prime Minister, Balladur had promised Chirac that he would not enter the [[French presidential election, 1995|1995 presidential election]], and that he would support Chirac's candidacy. However a number of right-wing politicians advised Balladur to run for the presidency in 1995. He went back on his promise to Chirac and entered the campaign. When he announced his candidacy, four months before the election, he was considered the favourite. In the polls, he led Chirac by almost 20 points. However from the position of an outsider, Chirac criticized Balladur as representing &quot;dominant ideas&quot;, and the difference between the two decreased quickly. The revelation of a bugging scandal which implicated Balladur also contributed to a drop in his popularity among voters. 

In the first round of the election, Balladur finished in third place with 18.6% of the vote behind the Socialist candidate [[Lionel Jospin]] and Chirac. He was thus eliminated from the final run-off election between the top two candidates which Chirac won.

Chirac immediately appointed [[Alain Juppé]] to replace Balladur as Prime Minister. Despite Chirac declaring that he and Balladur had been &quot;friends for 30 years&quot;, Balladur's decision to stand against him greatly strained their relationship. As a result, the &quot;Balladuriens&quot; who had supported him in the presidential election (such as [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]) were ostracized from the new Chirac administration.

===Later political career===
Balladur failed to win the elections for the presidency of the [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]] region in 1998, the RPR nomination for the mayoralty of Paris in 2001, and the Chair of the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] in 2002. He presided over the National Assembly's foreign affairs committee during his last parliamentary term (2002–2007). Since the 1980s, he had advocated the unification of the right-wing groupings into a single large party. Chirac realized this with the creation of the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] in 2002.

In 2007, when Nicolas Sarkozy was elected President of France, he nominated Balladur to the head of a committee for institutional reforms. The constitutional revision was approved by the Parliament in July 2008.

From 1968 to 1980, Balladur was president of the French company of the [[Mont Blanc Tunnel]], while occupying various other positions in ministerial staff. Following the 1999 deadly accident in the tunnel, he gave evidence to the court judging the case in 2005, about the security measures he had or had not taken. Balladur claimed that he always took security seriously, but that it was difficult to agree on anything with the Italian company operating the Italian part of the tunnel. From 1977 to 1986, he was president of ''Générale de Service Informatique'' (later merged into [[IBM Global Services]]), making him one of the few French politicians with business experience.

In 2006 he announced that he would not run again for re-election in 2007 as a member of Parliament for the 15th ''arrondissement'' of Paris, a conservative stronghold.

In 2008, Balladur visited the United States to speak at an event organized by the [[Streit Council|Streit Council for a Union of Democracies]], a [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]-based [[think tank|think-tank]]. Balladur presented his latest book, in which he outlined a concept for a &quot;Union of the West.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://streitcouncil.org/content/activities/events/balladur_08/balladur_bio.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Balladur is often caricatured as aloof, aristocratic and arrogant in media such as the ''[[Canard Enchaîné]]'' weekly or the ''[[Les Guignols de l'info]]'' TV show.

The '''Élysée Palace''' ({{lang-fr|Palais de l'Élysée}}, {{IPA-fr|palɛ də lelize|pron}}) is the [[official residence]] of the [[President of the French Republic]], containing his office, and is where the Council of Ministers meets. It is located near the [[Champs-Élysées]] in [[Paris]].

Important foreign visitors are hosted at the nearby [[Hôtel de Marigny]], a palatial residence. The Élysée has gardens, in which the president hosts a party on the afternoon of [[Bastille Day]]. [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], the President of France since 2007, is the current resident.

==History==

The architect Armand-Claude Mollet&lt;ref&gt;Armand Claude Mollet (1660-1742), from the [[Claude Mollet|Mollet dynasty of royal gardeners]], was the house architect for Henri-Louis, comte de Dreux. Sharing responsibilities for the [[Tuileries Garden]] with [[André Le Nôtre]]'s nephew [[Jean Le Nôtre]], he was accepted into the [[Académie royale d'architecture]] in 1699.&lt;/ref&gt; possessed a property fronting on the road to the village of Roule, west of Paris (now the [[Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré]]), and backing onto royal property, the ''Grand Cours'' through the [[Champs-Élysées]]. He sold this in 1718 to [[Louis Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne]], [[Évreux|comte d'Évreux]] (families: ducs and princes de Bouillon et Sedan: [[de la Marck]] | von der Marck), with the agreement that Mollet would construct an ''[[hôtel particulier]]'' for the count, fronted by an [[Cour d'honneur|entrance court]] and backed by a garden. The ''Hôtel d'Évreux'' was finished and decorated by 1722, and though it has undergone many modifications since, it remains a fine example of the French [[Classicism|classical]] style. At the time of his death in 1753, Évreux was the owner of one of the most widely admired houses in Paris, and it was bought by King [[Louis XV]] as a residence for the [[Marquise de Pompadour]], his mistress. Opponents showed their distaste for the regime by hanging signs on the gates that read: &quot;Home of the King's whore&quot;{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. After her death, it reverted to the crown.

In 1773, it was purchased by [[Nicolas Beaujon]], banker to the Court and one of the richest men in France, who needed a suitably sumptuous &quot;country house&quot; (for the city of Paris did not yet extend this far) to house his fabulous collection of great masters paintings. To this end, he hired the architect [[Étienne-Louis Boullée]] to make substantial alterations to the buildings (as well as  design an English-style garden). Soon on display there were such well-known masterpieces as [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein's]] ''The Ambassadors'' (now in the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]] in [[London]]), and [[Frans Hals]]' ''Bohemian'' (now at the [[Louvre]]). His architectural alterations and art galleries gave this residence international renown as &quot;one of the premier houses of Paris&quot;.

The palace and gardens were purchased from Beaujon by [[Bathilde d'Orléans|Bathilde, duchesse de Bourbon]] in 1787 for 1,300,000 ''livres''.&lt;ref&gt;C. Leroux-Cesbron, ''Le palais de l'Élysée, chronique d'un palais national'', 1925, deuxième édition, page 76.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the Duchess who named it the ''Élysée''.  She also built a group of cottages in the gardens which she named the [[Hameau de Chantilly (Paris)|Hameau de Chantilly]], after the [[Hameau de Chantilly|Hameau]] at her father-in-law's [[Château de Chantilly]].  With the [[French Revolution]], the Duchess fled the country and the Élysée was confiscated.  It was leased out. The gardens were used for eating, drinking, and dancing, under the name Hameau de Chantilly; and the rooms became gambling houses.&lt;ref name='haynie'&gt;Henry Haynie, ''Paris: Past &amp; Present'' '''2''', New York, 1902. [http://books.google.com/books?id=LUHoQHxR0MMC at Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1803, the Élysée was sold to [[Joachim Murat]], and in 1808, to [[Napoléon I|the Emperor]], and it became known as the Élysée-Napoléon.  After the [[Battle of Waterloo]], Napoléon returned to the Élysée, signed his [[abdication]] there on 22 June 1815, and left the Élysée on the 25th.&lt;ref name='haynie'/&gt;

Russian Cossacks camped at the Élysée when they occupied Paris in 1814. The property was then returned to it's previous owner, the Duchesse de Bourbon, who then sold it to her royal cousin, [[Louis XVIII]] in 1816.

Under the provisional government of the [[Second French Republic|Second Republic]], it took the name of the ''Élysée National'' and was designated the official residence of the President of the Republic. (The President also has the use of several other official residences, including the [[Château de Rambouillet]], forty five kilometres southwest of Paris, and the [[Fort de Brégançon]] near [[Marseille]].)
[[File:Palais elysee.jpg|thumb|right|250px| The palace seen from the gardens]]
In 1853, following his ''coup d'état'' that ended the Second Republic, [[Napoleon III of France|Napoléon III]] charged the architect Joseph-Eugène Lacroix with renovations; meanwhile he moved to the nearby [[Tuileries Palace]], but kept the Élysée as a discreet place to meet his mistresses, moving between the two palaces through a secret underground passage that has since been demolished.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Since Lacroix completed his work in 1867, the essential look of the ''Palais de l'Élysée'' has remained the same.

In 1873, during the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]], The Élysée became the official presidential residence.

In 1917, an [[orangutan]] escaped from a nearby ''[[menagerie|ménagerie]]'', entered the palace and was said to have tried to haul the wife of President [[Raymond Poincaré]] into a tree only to be foiled by Élysée guards. President [[Paul Deschanel]], who resigned in 1920 because of mental illness, was said to have been so impressed by the orangutan's feat that, to the alarm of his guests, he took to jumping into trees during state receptions.

The Élysée Palace was closed in June 1940, and remained empty during [[World War II]]. It was reoccupied only in 1946 by [[Vincent Auriol]], President of the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|Provisional Government]], then first President of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] from 1947 to 1954.

Between 1959 and 1969, the Élysée was occupied by [[Charles de Gaulle]], the first President of the [[Fifth French Republic|Fifth Republic]]. De Gaulle did not like its lack of privacy, and oversaw the purchase of the luxurious [[Hôtel de Marigny]] to lodge foreign State officials in visit to France, saying, &quot;I do not like the idea of meeting kings walking around my corridors in their pyjamas.&quot;
[[Image:Salon doré Palais de l'Élysée1.JPG|thumb|right|250px||The &quot;Salon doré&quot; (''Golden Room''), office of the [[President of the French Republic]].]]
Socialist President [[François Mitterrand]], who governed from 1981 to 1995, is said to have seldom used its private apartments, preferring the privacy of his own home on the more [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] [[Left Bank]]. A discreet flat in the Élysée housed his mistress [[Anne Pingeot]], mother of his illegitimate daughter [[Mazarine Pingeot]].

By contrast, his successor [[Jacques Chirac]] lived throughout his two terms in office (1995–2007) in the Élysée apartments with his wife [[Bernadette Chirac|Bernadette]].

Chirac increased the Palace's budget by 105% to 90 million euros per year, according to the book ''L'argent caché de l'Élysée''. One million euros per year is spent on drinks alone for the guests invited to the Élysée Palace, 6.9 million euros per year on bonuses for presidential staff and 6.1 million euros per year on the 145 extra employees Chirac hired after he was elected in 1995.&lt;!-- the President's salary does not come out of the budget of the Élysée Palace/FW --&gt;

Chirac's successor [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] prefers his wife [[Carla Bruni-Sarkozy]]'s house in Paris XVI to the Élysée palace.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The '''French Fourth Republic''' was the [[republicanism|republican]] government of [[France]] between 1946 and 1958, governed by the fourth republican [[Constitution of France|constitution]]. It was in many ways a revival of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]], which was in place before [[World War II]], and suffered many of the same problems. France adopted the constitution of the Fourth Republic on 13 October 1946.

The Fourth Republic saw an era of great economic growth in France and the rebuilding of the nation's social institutions and industry after the war, and played an important part in the development of the process of European integration which changed the continent permanently. The greatest accomplishments of the Fourth Republic were in social reform and economic development. In 1946, the government established a comprehensive social security system that assured unemployment insurance, disability and old-age pensions, and medical care to all citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;&quot;France&quot;, Microsoft® Encarta® Encyclopedia 2001. © 1993-2000 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some attempts were also made to strengthen the executive branch of government to prevent the unstable situation that had existed before the war, but the instability remained and the Fourth Republic saw frequent changes in government – there were 20 governments in ten years. Additionally, the government proved unable to make effective decisions regarding [[decolonization]]. As a result, the Fourth Republic collapsed and what some critics considered to be a de facto ''coup d'état'', subsequently legitimized by a referendum on 5 October 1958, led to the establishment of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] in 1959.

==Founding of the Fourth Republic (1944–47)==
{{Main|Three-parties |Third Force (France)}}

After the [[liberation of France]], the [[Vichy government]] was dissolved and the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] (GPRF) was instituted. With most of the political class discredited and containing many members who had more or less [[Collaborationism|collaborated]] with the enemy, Gaullism and Communism became the most popular political forces in France.

Charles de Gaulle led the GPRF from 1944 to 1946. Meanwhile, negotiations took place over the proposed new Constitution, which was to be put to a referendum. De Gaulle advocated a presidential system of government, and criticized the reinstatement of what he pejoratively called &quot;the parties system&quot;. He resigned in January 1946 and was replaced by [[Félix Gouin]] (SFIO). Ultimately only the PCF and the SFIO supported the draft Constitution, which envisaged a form of government based on [[unicameralism]]; but this was rejected in the [[French constitutional referendum, May 1946|referendum of 5 May 1946]].

For the 1946 elections, the [[Rally of the Republican Lefts|RGR]] (''Rassemblement des gauches républicaines''), which encompassed the [[Radical-Socialist Party]], the UDSR and other conservative parties, unsuccessfully attempted to oppose the MRP-SFIO-PCF alliance. The new [[Constituent Assembly]] included 166 MRP deputies, 153 PCF deputies and 128 SFIO deputies, giving the Tripartite alliance an [[absolute majority]]. [[Georges Bidault]] (MRP) replaced [[Félix Gouin]] as the head of government. 

A new draft of the Constitution was written, which this time proposed the establishment of a [[bicameral]] form of government. [[Léon Blum]] (SFIO) headed the GPRF from 1946 to 1947. After a new legislative election in June 1946, the Christian-Democrat [[Georges Bidault]] assumed leadership of the cabinet. Despite de Gaulle's so-called [[discourse of Bayeux]] of 16 June 1946 in which he denounced the new institutions, the new draft was approved by the [[French people]], with 53% of voters voting in favor (with an [[abstention]] rate of 31%) in the [[French constitutional referendum, October 1946|referendum held on 13 October 1946]]. This culminated in the establishment in the following year of the [[Fourth Republic]], an arrangement in which executive power essentially resided in the hands of the [[President of the Council]]. The [[President of the Republic]] was given a largely symbolic role, although he remained chief of the Army and as a last resort could be called upon to resolve conflicts.

==The failure of the rationalization of the parliamentary system==

The intention of Constitutional text's writers was to rationalize the parliamentary system. In this, the ministers were accountable to the legislative body, the [[French National Assembly]]), but some constitutional measures were introduced in order to protect the cabinet and to reinforce the authority of the [[Prime Minister of France|President of the Council]], who lead the cabinet. The goal of the constituents was to reconcile parliamentary democracy and ministerial stability.

For instance, according to the Constitution, the President of the Council was the leader of the executive branch. The [[President of the French Republic]], elected by the Parliament (the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] and the [[Council of the Republic]]), played a symbolic role. His main power was to propose a President of the Council. This one was elected by the National Assembly before to form his cabinet. In this, in the cabinet, only the President of the Council could invoke the legitimacy of the parliamentary vote.

Also, he was the only member of the executive power to provoke a vote of confidence in the National Assembly (in the Third Republic, any minister could provoke a vote of confidence). The cabinet could be dismissed if the absolute majority of National Assembly's members voted against the cabinet. Finally, the National Assembly could be dissolved after two ministerial crisis in the legislature.

However, these constitutional measures did not work. In January 1947, after his election by the National Assembly and the nomination of his ministers, President of the Council [[Paul Ramadier]] provoked a vote of confidence in order to verify the Assembly approved the composition of his cabinet. He introduced a custom: the double election, which weakened his authority over the cabinet. Besides, the cabinets dismissed but only a plurality (not the absolute majority) of the National Assembly voting against the cabinet. Consequently, these ministerial crisis were not take into account into the calculation for the release of the dissolution. The habits of the Third Republic were come back at full speed and the regime was characterized by a strong ministerial instability.

The Fourth Republic was victim of the political context. The split of the [[Three-parties]] alliance in spring 1947, the departure of Communist ministers, Gaullist opposition, and the new proportional representation did not create the conditions of a ministerial stability. Governmental coalitions were composed of a patchwork of undisciplined centre-left and centre-right parties. Finally, the Fourth Republic faced with the collapse of the French colonial empire.

==European Unity==

The creation of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC) was first proposed by French foreign minister &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;[[Robert Schuman]]&lt;/span&gt; and French economic theorist &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;[[Jean Monnet]]&lt;/span&gt; on 9 May 1950 as a way to prevent further war between France and Germany. Though the United Kingdom was invited, its Labour government, then preparing for a re-election fight, did not join the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Dell, Edmund (1995). ''The Schuman Plan and the British Abdication of Leadership in Europe''. Oxford: Clarendon Press. {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was formally established in 1951 by the [[Treaty of Paris (1951)|Treaty of Paris]], signed France, Italy and the three [[Benelux]] states: Belgium, [[Luxembourg]] and the Netherlands. Between these states the ECSC would create a common market for coal and steel. The ECSC was governed by a 'High Authority', checked by bodies representing governments, MPs and an independent judiciary.

The ECSC was superseded, on 25 March 1957, by the [[Treaty of Rome]], which established the [[European Economic Community]] (which would, in 1993, become the [[European Union]] through the [[Treaty of Maastricht]]).

==Decolonization and end of the Fourth Republic==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Algerian War]] --&gt;
[[Algerian War|Rebellion in Algeria]] began soon after [[French Indochina|Indochinese]] independence. The government was initially successful in containing the rebellion, but the [[torture during the Algerian War|torture]] methods used by French military and security forces caused an enormous scandal when made public.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} The use of [[conscription]] also made the war extremely socially divisive. While French forces were victorious from a strictly military point of view, a large section of the public questioned the morality of maintaining colonies by force.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

The instability and ineffectiveness of the Fourth Republic came to a head in the [[May 1958 crisis|Algiers crisis of 1958]], when the current government suggested that it would negotiate with the Algerian nationalists. Right-wing elements in the [[French Army]], led by General &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;[[Jacques Massu]]&lt;/span&gt;, seized power in [[Algiers]] and threatened to conduct a parachute assault on Paris unless &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;[[Charles de Gaulle]]&lt;/span&gt; was placed in charge of the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crozier |first=Brian |coauthors=Mansell, Gerard |year=1960 |month=July |title=France and Algeria |journal=[[International Affairs (journal)|International Affairs]]|volume=36 |issue=3|pages=310–321 |doi=10.2307/2610008|quote= |publisher=International Affairs (Royal Institute of International Affairs 1944–), Vol. 36, No. 3 |jstor= 2610008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;De Gaulle&lt;/span&gt; did so under the precondition that a new constitution would be introduced creating a powerful presidency in which a sole executive, the first of which was to be &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;De Gaulle&lt;/span&gt;, ruled for seven-year periods. These changes were introduced and the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] was born.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6653">{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}
'''Hervé Gaymard''' (born 31 May 1960 in [[Bourg-Saint-Maurice]], Savoie) is a French politician and a member of [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] conservative party. He served as the country's [[Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industry (France)|Minister of Finances]] from 30 November 2004 until his resignation on 25 February 2005.  

Gaymard attended the ''[[Paris Institute of Political Studies|Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris]] (Sciences Po)'' and then at the ''[[École nationale d'administration]]'', graduating from the latter in 1986. After that he worked as a civil servant in a number of finance-related positions.

He was elected as a local councillor in Savoie's [[canton de Moûtiers]] in 1994. He later served on the departmental council of Savoie, and in 1999, became [[President of the general council|its president]]. He was appointed to the finance ministry in November 2004, and was forced to resign barely 12 weeks later, on Friday, 25 Feb 2005.

He is married to [[Clara Lejeune]], daughter of geniticist [[Jérôme Lejeune]]. A Catholic, he is the father of eight children: Philothée, Bérénice, Thaïs, Amédée, Eulalie, Faustine, Jérôme-Aristide, Angélico.

==Scandal==
Gaymard's resignation as Minister of Finances came after the satirical and investigative newspaper ''[[Le Canard enchaîné]]'' disclosed on 16 Feb 2005 that the government was funding an exclusive apartment for Gaymard and his family (his wife and his 8 children). The [[duplex]] apartment, located in the exclusive &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; neighbourhood off Paris' [[Champs-Élysées]], reportedly had an area of 600&amp;nbsp;m² (6460 sq ft) and cost the state a monthly rental of €14,000. Aside from the luxuriously high rent, the state was also funding $3,300 a month for maintenance and three parking spaces, $42,000 to renovate the apartment and the parking area, and $16,000 in real estate fees.

== Resignation ==

While Gaymard's actions were not illegal, the exposure of Gaymard's accepting lavish, state-funded perks, then attempting to lie in interviews, was bad news for the government at a time when the French public was asked to accept more economic sacrifices while reeling from a staggering unemployment rate that reached 10% in January, the highest level in over five years. Gaymard himself had said that the French should become &quot;detoxified&quot; of public spending. Curbing spending has been at the fore-front of Gaymard's office, giving hope to voters that the economy there would soon improve. And, as it was part of his responsibilities to regulate the housing market, he could not be unaware of the difficulties facing families seeking affordable accommodations. 

He resigned less than 5 hours before he was to give a televised interview defending his actions. In his issued statement, he said, &quot;I am aware that I committed blunders and, above all, a serious error of judgement…&quot;

Following this scandal, Prime Minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] tightened up the rules for public officials using state-funded apartments. However, the ''Canard'' soon revealed that Budget Minister [[Jean-François Copé]] also enjoyed an expensive apartment paid for by the state while he owned an apartment in Paris.

There has been some controversy regarding how the ''Canard'' and ''Libération'' had obtained such information. It was at some point suggested that they were orchestrated by [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], a political rival of Gaymard from the same party.

On August 26, 2005, Hervé Gaymard was reintegrated into the [[French Civil Service|civil service]] corps of the ''administrateurs civils'', with a ''hors-classe'' rank, and assigned to the Ministry of Finances (direction of the budget). ([http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=PRMG0570796A ministerial decision] in ''[[Journal Officiel de la République Française|Journal Officiel]]'', 13 September 2005; ''[[Le Monde]]'', 20 September 2005) after refunding the state the €58,894 that the refurbishing of his apartment had cost. Hervé Gaymard has previously announced that he considered working in the private sector. It is unknown, at this point, whether he considers going back to politics in the future.

The '''''Institut d'études politiques de Paris''''' ({{lang-en|Paris Institute of Political Studies}}), simply referred to as '''''Sciences Po''''' ({{IPA-fr|sijɑ̃s po}}), is a [[Établissement public à caractère scientifique, culturel et professionnel|public research and higher education institution]] in [[Paris]], [[France]], specialised in the [[social sciences]]. It has the status of ''[[grand établissement]]'', which allows its admissions process to be highly selective. Established in 1872, Sciences Po has traditionally educated France's political and diplomatic elite.

Its name refers to the political sciences, in the plural. Accordingly, its academic scope includes political science, as well as economics, history, sociology, law, finance, business, communication, social and urban policy, management and journalism. It offers several dual master’s degrees, in partnership with such institutions as the [[London School of Economics]], the [[Free University of Berlin]], the [[Hertie School of Governance]] in Berlin, the [[School of International and Public Affairs]] at [[Columbia University]], the [[Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy]] at the [[National University of Singapore]], the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]] and [[ESADE]]. At the undergraduate level, it also offers a dual degree program with the School of General Studies at [[Columbia University]]. 

The campus is located near the [[Seine River]], between [[Boulevard Saint Germain]] and [[Boulevard Raspail]]; within walking distance of most major sights, such as ''[[Notre Dame de Paris]]'', the ''[[Grand Palais]]'', the ''[[Panthéon]]'', and the ''[[Assemblée Nationale]]''. It is housed primarily in 17th and 18th century mansions located on the [[Rive Gauche|left bank]], on and around [[Rue Saint-Guillaume]], [[Rue des Saints Pères]] and [[Rue de l'Université]] (in the [[VIIe arrondissement|7th arondissement]]).

==History==
The name ''Sciences Po'' refers to three distinct, yet complementary institutions:
* ''[[École Libre des Sciences Politiques]]'', which was replaced in 1945 by :
** ''[[Fondation nationale des sciences politiques]]'' (''FNSP''), a research foundation; and
** ''[[Institut d'études politiques de Paris]]'' (''IEP de Paris''), a teaching institution.

===1872–1945===
[[Image:Émile Boutmy.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sciences Po Founder, Émile Boutmy.]]
''Sciences Po'' was established in February 1872 as the ''[[École Libre des Sciences Politiques]]'' by a group of French intellectuals, politicians and businessmen led by [[Émile Boutmy]], and including [[Hippolyte Taine]], [[Ernest Renan]], [[Albert Sorel]], [[Pierre Paul Leroy-Beaulieu|Paul Leroy Beaulieu]], and [[François Guizot]]. Following defeat in the 1870 war, the demise of [[Napoleon III]], and the [[Paris Commune]], these men sought to reform the training of French politicians. Politically and economically, people feared France's international stature was waning due to inadequate teaching of its political and diplomatic corps. ''ELSP'' was meant to serve as “the breeding ground where nearly all the major, non-technical state commissioners were trained.”&lt;ref name=&quot;purpose&quot;&gt;“Sciences Po 1945–1979” ''[http://chevs.sciences-po.fr/archives/fonds/sciences_po_2_en.htm Centre d’histoire de Sciences Po]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The school developed a [[humanistic]] and pragmatic teaching program: instructors included academics as well as ministers, high civil servants, and businessmen. New discipines such as [[International Relations]], [[International Law]], [[Political Economy]] and [[Comparative Government]] were introduced. In August 1894, the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] spoke out for the need to advance the study of politics along the lines of ''ELSP''. [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]] used the purpose and curriculum of ''Sciences Po'' as part of their inspiration for creating the [[London School of Economics]] in 1895.{{ref|Dahrendorf}}

===The situation since 1945===
As per ordinance 45-2284, issued by [[Charles de Gaulle]] on 9 October 1945, two entities were created from ''ELSP'': ''[[Fondation nationale des sciences politiques]]'' ({{lang-en|National Foundation of Political Science}}) or ''FNSP'' and ''Institut d'études politiques de Paris'' ({{lang-en|Paris Institute of Political Studies}}) or ''IEP Paris''.{{ref|1945ordinance}}  Both entities were tasked by the French government to ensure “the progress and the diffusion, both within and outside France, of political science, economics, and sociology”&lt;ref name=&quot;purpose&quot; /&gt;

The epithet ''Sciences Po'' was applied to both entities, which inherited the reputation previously vested in ''ELSP''.{{ref|duality}} France's Legislature entrusted ''FNSP'' with managing ''IEP Paris'', its library, and budget, and an administrative council assured the development of these activities. The curriculum and methodology of the ''ELSP'' were also the template for creating an entire system of institutes of political studies (French: [[Institut d'études politiques]]) across France, namely in Strasbourg, Lyon, Aix, Bordeaux, Grenoble, Toulouse, and then in Rennes and Lille. They are not to be confounded with Sciences Po's satellite campuses.

''FNSP'' further strengthened its role as a scientific publication center with significant donations from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. ''FNSP'' periodicals such as ''la Revue française de science politique'', ''le Bulletin analytique de documentation'', ''la Chronologie politique africaine'', and the ''Cahiers de la Fondation'' as well as its seven research centres and main publishing house, ''Presses de Sciences Po'', contribute to the reputation attained by ''Sciences Po'' research.&lt;ref name=&quot;purpose&quot; /&gt;

===Recent reforms===
''Sciences Po'' has undergone myriad reforms under [[Richard Descoings]], Director of ''Sciences Po'' (1997–present). ''Sciences Po'' has introduced a compulsory year abroad component to its undergraduate degree, and now offers a multilingual curriculum in French, English, and other languages. New educational sites have been set up in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[Dijon]], [[Poitiers]], [[Menton]], [[Le Havre]] and [[Reims]]. ''Sciences Po'' also set the length of its undergraduate program to three years and its graduate program to two years in line with the [[Bologna Process]].

''Sciences Po'' also implemented reforms in its admissions process. Previously, ''Sciences Po'' recruited its students almost exclusively from elite schools (mostly state-funded) in France, but in March 2001, the school's governing council widened its admissions policy.{{ref|NYUsource}} From September 2002, ''Sciences Po'' began accepting a small batch of students from certain schools located in economically depressed suburbs of Paris on the basis of their school record and a 45-minute interview, rather than the name-blind examination all other students must pass to be admitted. The reform is intended to broaden the socio-economic characteristics of ''Sciences Po'' student-body, and gained national and international media attention for being the first [[affirmative action]] experience in France, despite the initial controversy it brought up it is now broadly accepted by the French and considered a relative success. Moreover, ''Sciences Po'' introduced an alternative recruitment method -the so-called ''procédure internationale''- for foreign students or students with an international background, as they are not well prepared for the French written examination. ''Sciences Po'' also accepts a large contingent of graduate students from abroad without written exams.

===Rankings===
In September 2007, Sciences Po was rated the 8th best university in the world by the annual higher education survey conducted by the École des Mines de Paris thus placing it above both [[Oxford university|Oxford]] and [[Yale university|Yale]]. In 2008 Sciences Po ranked 11th, below Oxford and just above Yale,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ensmp.fr/Actualites/PR/EMP-ranking.html#7 |title=Professional Ranking of World Universities 2008 by MINES ParisTech |publisher=Ensmp.fr |accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2009 it ranked 15th.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mines-paristech.fr/Actualites/PR/EMP-ranking.pdf ]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ranking by the École des Mines asks CEOs of the 500 biggest multinational companies where they did their studies.

There are more than 70 clubs and organizations, such as [[PIMUN|Paris International Model United Nations]] and Sciences Po Finance (Finance society).

==Undergraduate program==
===Description===
In 2000, ''Sciences Po'' set the length of its undergraduate program to three years and the length of its graduate program to two years in line with the Bologna Process. The first three years of study are referred to as the ''premiers cycles'', which focuses on the full-range of the [[social sciences]], particularly [[public policy]], [[International Relations]], economics and [[political economy]], management studies, finance, [[geography]], constitutional and administrative law, [[philosophy]], and [[sociology]]. Students generally spend their third year of the ''premier cycle'' abroad, at one of Sciences Po's nearly 300 partner schools around the world. Students are, however, also given the option of spending the year interning for an institution related to their field of study. In addition to academics, ''Sciences Po'''s curriculum incorporates more practice-oriented skills like teamwork, effective oral communication and presentation skills, and nurturing leadership potential. Sciences Po's student-body is active, with more than seventy student clubs, councils, and organizations.

As of 2010, almost half of the student body was foreign. In recent years, ''Sciences Po'' has adopted a multi-lingual education policy: students are expected to be proficient in at least two foreign languages. More than one-third of classes are provided in languages others than French, including English, Spanish, German, and Italian. Currently, however, fluency in French is required for admission to most ''Sciences Po'' degrees.

===Satellite Campuses===
While all of Sciences Po's graduate programs are taught in Paris, the school has six additional undergraduate campuses in France. Each of the six campuses has its own distinct cultural identity and academic focus. They are designed to widen the academic concentration of the wider Sciences Po community, and allow students enrolled in the three-year Sciences Po undergraduate program, the collège universitaire, to specialize in a given region. Students who wish to study at either of the six satellite campuses usually need to apply through the Sciences Po admission services. Upon completing their undergraduate studies by spending a year abroad, all students usually move to Paris for their graduate studies (Master).

As the satellite campuses are part of Sciences Po Paris, their official designations always include the word &quot;Paris&quot; in order to distinguish them from the so-called &quot;IEP de province&quot;. For instance, Sciences Po Paris' Dijon campus is officially named Sciences Po Paris in Dijon:

These are 6 regional campuses:
:* '''French-German Undergraduate Program''' / [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] (created in 2000) :
The French-German Undergraduate Program is located in Nancy, which is at the centre of the Lorraine region of France, and maintains close ties to the German-speaking world given its proximity to the German border. Strasbourg and the European Parliament are also located nearby. This premier cycle focuses on the history of Franco-German relations, and its relevance for the future integration of the European continent. The main languages of instruction on campus are English, German, and French, and the student body is primarily made up of students from France and German-speaking countries.
:* '''European Undergraduate Program''' / [[Dijon]] (created 2001) :
The European Undergraduate Program is located in Dijon, which is the capital of the Burgundy region of France. The area is renowned for its winemaking and gastronomic heritage. A real Europe in miniature, the European Campus of Sciences Po welcomes students of more than twenty nationalities for the bachelor with a specific focus on the European Union and on the East Central European studies. This premier cycle initiates students into the challenges of the widened European Union, and Central European politics and history. Courses are taught in English and French, but students may also study at least one Central-European language (either Czech, Hungarian, Polish), italian (with an initiation of romanian) or russian.
:* '''Euro-Latin American Undergraduate Program''' / [[Poitiers]] (created 2001) :
[[Image:Sciences Po Poiters.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sciences Po Poitiers Campus.]]
The Ibero-American Undergraduate Program is located in Poitiers, a small city in western France. This premier cycle specializes in the politics and history of Iberia and Latin America. Courses are taught in French, Spanish, Portuguese, and English. The majority of students come from Spain, Portugal, and Latin America.
:* '''Middle Eastern and Mediterranean Undergraduate Program''' / [[Menton]] (created 2005):
The Middle Eastern and Mediterranean Undergraduate Program is located in Menton, a town on the French Riviera minutes from Monaco and the Italian border. This premier cycle gathers students from North Africa, the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, Israel, and all European nations. In particular, it focuses on the study of relationships between the northern and southern sides of the Mediterranean, as well as the analysis of the links between Europe and the Middle East. Courses are taught in French, English, and Arabic.
:* '''Euro-Asian Undergraduate Program''' / [[Le Havre]] (created 2007) :
The Euro-Asian Undergraduate Program is located in Le Havre, a city in Haute Normandy in northern France. The biggest port city of France, Le Havre, is UNESCO world heritage city. French/European students can learn Chinese, Japanese, Hindi, and Korean, in addition to English; while Asian students have to study French and one of the Asian languages, other than their mother-tongue. All courses during first year are in English, flavored with French in the background, to put the students at ease; but gradually moves towards French as the medium of instruction by the end second semester. It is therefore important to be able to speak, write, read and effectively communicate in French, else it can become quite challenging, especially when learning an Asian language is manadatory for all.
:* '''Euro-American Undergraduate Program''' / [[Reims]] (created 2009) :
The Euro-American Undergraduate Program in Reims, housed in a former Jesuit College, has opened its doors in September 2010 and  focuses on transatlantic relations. 45 minutes from Paris by train, Reims is famous for being the coronation site of the Kings of France and for its impressive Gallo-Roman heritage. Its rich past, its architecture ans its ancient Champagne producing tradition put this city of the Champagne-Ardennes region at the very heart of European and French history.

===Third Year abroad===
[[Richard Descoings]] has decided in the reforms he engaged at Sciences Po that every student should spend his third year abroad. Thanks to 350 university partners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.sciences-po.fr/en/partner-universities |title=Partner Universities , Sciences-Po International |publisher=International.sciences-po.fr |accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; students at Sciences Po have multiple possibilities. Students can also do an internship in a company, a cultural association, an embassy, etc.

==Master's degrees==
===Description===
Upon completion of the third year of undergraduate studies, students return to Paris for a two-year graduate program of their choosing leading to a Master's degree. Students from the school's undergraduate programs make up about half of the graduate programs' student population, the remainder having completed undergraduate studies elsewhere in France or abroad. Most programs are taught in more than one language though English-only programs are also available. Students can choose from a wide array of programs designed either by Sciences Po alone or in conjunction with other universities.

===Single Master's degrees===
The school's traditional &quot;single&quot; Master's degrees are suited for those seeking to develop professional skills in a specific area without losing the benefits of a generalist education. The curriculum generally comprises a set of generalist courses known as the &quot;tronc commun,&quot; specific courses related to the chosen field of study, and an internship semester.
:* '''[[International relations|International Affairs]]'''
:* '''European Affairs'''
:* '''Public Affairs''' (with a focus on France)
:* '''Urban Planning and Regional Studies'''
:* '''[[Law School]]'''
:* '''[[Human Resource Management]]'''
:* '''Finance and Strategy'''
:* '''Marketing'''
:* '''[[Journalism School]]'''
:* '''School of Communication'''
:* '''Economics and Public Policy''' in association with the Polytechnique and the ENSAE (School of Statistics) with support of Nobel Prize laureates such as Edmund Phelps, Joseph Stiglitz and Amartya Sen.

Students eyeing with an academic career can apply for admission into '''research-based programs''' with an additional focus on scientific methods. The requirement to gain work experience during the internship semester is replaced with a requirement to write a Master's thesis. The school has offered ''Master recherche'' programs in such fields as economic governance, theory of organisations, political theory, sociology, and history. However, as of early 2009, the school is overhauling all of its research-based programs.

===Dual Master's degrees===
Alternatively, students can apply for admission into one of the school's double degree programs designed in conjunction with partner universities in France and abroad. Students are awarded two degrees upon studying one year at each university. As the writing of a Master's thesis is often part of the graduation requirements at partner universities, dual programs can also be suited for those interested in an academic career.

Most recently, instructors included or still include former French Prime Minister [[Dominique de Villepin]], current WTO president [[Pascal Lamy]], former French Prime Minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]], former French foreign minister [[Hubert Védrine]], Nobel Prize Laureate economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]], former Lebanese Minister of Culture [[Ghassan Salame]] and former Economics minister as well as former Managing Director of IMF [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]]. These instructors are anchored by around 800 tenured professors

==Global Public Policy Network==
''Sciences Po'' offers dual master’s degrees with the [[London School of Economics]], the [[School of International and Public Affairs]] at [[Columbia University]], the [[Hertie School of Governance]] in Berlin, and the [[Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy]] at the [[National University of Singapore]]. This collaboration has existed since the early 1990s, but was formalized in September 2005 with the official launch of the Global Public Policy Network in Beijing, China. The partnership is meant to foster greater academic collaboration between students, faculty, and research centers of four leading public policy schools in what could arguably be termed four [[Global city|world capital cities]].{{ref|GPPN}} The network is further intended to facilitate collaboration on public policy research, student and faculty exchanges, and international conferences and fora with policymakers from the USA, Germany, UK, France and [[Singapore]]. This alliance has produced five degree programs with LSE, including masters degrees in [[International Relations]], [[Negotiation]], [[International Political Economy]], [[Public administration|Public Affairs]], the Practice of International Affairs, and [[Urban Policy]], two degree programs with Columbia, specifically a Master in [[International relations|International Affairs]], dual [[Master of Public Policy]] and [[Master of Public Administration]] with the [[Hertie School of Governance]], and a Master in Public Affairs, and one degree program with LKS, a Master in [[Public Policy]].{{ref|joint-degrees}}

==Research==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Iep.jpg|thumb|School Gardens{{speedy-image-c|14 March, unless its copyright status can be clarified}}]] --&gt;

===Doctoral School===
The Doctoral School is currently directed by [[Hervé Crès]] and includes 175 faculty members and 600 doctoral students. It was created in 1988 and welcomes students for their Master and PhD studies.

===Research Master's===

The Research Master’s program entails two years of interdisciplinary instruction in four basic social sciences: political science, history, sociology and economics. This interdisciplinary approach is designed to reinforce and round out graduate-level training. The Research Master’s program prepares students for doctoral studies and subsequent careers in research and higher education. But it also opens out into a wider range of career options (work in consulting, expertise, public opinion polling, publishing etc.) thanks to the links between the Sciences Po Master’s degree and Research Master’s programs in the form of joint courses and degrees.

The Research Master’s program offers:
* an outstanding academic framework
* close administrative support all the way through to entry into professional life
* openness and close links to outside academic and professional domains at national and international levels.

Students in the Research Master’s program can choose from among six concentrations: History and Theory of Politics, International Relations, Politics and Society in Europe, Comparative Politics, Sociology of Action, Economic Governance.
* History and Theory of Politics, with two specialities:
** History
** Political philosophy
* Comparative Politics with four specialities:
** Asia
** Latin America
** Muslim world
** Russia and CIS
* International relations with three specialities:
** Political science of international relations
** History of the international relations
** Economy of the international relations
* Economic Governance
* Politics and Society in Europe proposes four specialities:
** Sociological analysis of change
** Europe
** Public policy
** Political sociology
* Sociology of Action

===PhD Program===
Sciences Po is accredited to confer PhD degrees in economics, history, political science and sociology.

The Sciences Po PhD Program counts roughly 600 doctoral candidates, a third of whom hail from abroad. About 40 defend their dissertations each year. The program has a long-standing tradition of multi-disciplinary scholarship.

The PhD Program covers 15 fields of study, which follow up on those offered in the Master’s program: Latin America, Sociological Analysis of Change, Asia, Economics of International Relations, United States, Europe, International Finance, Economic Governance, History, Muslim World, Political Thought, Russia/CIS, Political Science of International Relations, Sociology of Action, Political Sociology and Public Policy.

In addition to academic training, the PhD Program provides a number of student services, including financial aid for PhD studies as well as for research abroad, support and promotion for publications, and job placement guidance and assistance.

===Habilitation===
Sciences Po awards a French postdoctoral degree called Habilitation qualifying the holder to supervise doctoral research in economics, history, political science and sociology.

Habilitation is the crowning degree for university studies in France: it attests to the holder’s high level of scholarship, the originality of their approach, the ability to master a research strategy in a sufficiently broad field of inquiry and to supervise young scholars. It qualifies the holder, moreover, to join the corps of university professors.

===Research centres===
''FNSP'' manages the research faculty and facilities of ''Sciences Po'', and is one of the largest [[social sciences]] research bodies in Europe. ''FNSP'' manages research centres, a doctoral school, a library and a publishing house. The FNSP manages eight research centres (five jointly with [[CNRS]]). The foundation of ''Sciences Po'' predates by a few decades the creation of [[political science]], as such the Institute focuses on all the social sciences that study the political field.

* [[History]]
** CHSP (''Centre d’histoire de Sciences Po'') directed by [[Jean-François Sirinelli]]
* [[Sociology]]
** OSC (''Observatoire sociologique du changement'') directed by [[Alain Chenu]]
** CSO (''Centre de Sociologie des organisations'') directed by [[Christine Musselin]]
* [[Economics]]. The Department of Economics at Sciences Po is directed by [[Philippe Martin (economist)|Philippe Martin]]. It is constituted of two research centers:
** GEM (''Groupe d'économie mondiale'') directed by [[Patrick Messerlin]]
** OFCE (''Observatoire français des conjonctures économiques'') directed by [[Philippe Weil]]
* [[International Relations]]
** CERI (''Centre d’études et de recherches internationales'') directed by [[Christian Lequesne]]
** CEE (''Centre d’études européennes de Sciences Po'') directed by [[Renaud Dehousse]]
* [[Political Science]] in France and Europe
** CEVIPOF (''Centre d’étude de la vie politique française'') directed by [[Pascal Perrineau]]
** CDSP (''Centre de données sociopolitiques de Sciences Po'') directed by [[Alain Chenu]]

===Research networks===
* EUREDOCS : European Research &amp; Higher Education Doctoral Studies network:
Euredocs is a network run by Sciences Po made up of doctoral students and recent PhD recipients (who have defended their dissertations within the past three years). The network addresses the Europeanization of higher education and research, including such issues as the structure of academic curricula, evaluation/accreditation procedures, changes in national education policies and university governance, academic career patterns, the production of knowledge, the impact of internationalization/globalization etc.
* GARNET Network of Excellence : “Global Governance, Regionalisation and Regulation: The Role of the EU”
Funded under the European Commission’s 6th Framework Programme, the GARNET network gathers 42 leading research centres and universities in Europe and operates with a budget of 5,4 millions euros over 5 years (2005–2010). Sciences Po is represented in the network by CERI who runs a specific “dissemination of excellence” programme. A number of GARNET activities address doctoral students and finance their participation:
** PhD School Network develops interdisciplinary seminar programmes focusing on key theoretical and methodological issues on global governance and the role of the EU. These one-week seminars bring together professors and PhD students from all over Europe and the world;
** Research programmes are particularly welcoming participation of doctoral students, namely 18 Jointly Executed Research Projects, the “Capacity Building in Professional Training on Issues of Global Governance and Regulation” program and GARNET Annual Conferences;
** Mobility programme offers up to 1,500 Euros/ month allowance to doctoral students at the later stages of their dissertation wishing to participate in the research activities of GARNET partner institutions for short or long period.
* Connex Network of Excellence on Efficient and Democratic Governance in a Multi-level Europe:
CONNEX is a network set up under the 6th Framework Programme for European Research and Technological Development (2002–2006) to analyze various facets of democratic governance in Europe.

==Library and publishing==
===Library (Bibliothèque de Sciences Po)===
Founded in 1871, the nucleus of the school’s research is ''Bibliothèque de Sciences Po'', which &quot;houses&quot; 650,000 books about [[social sciences]] and 4,500 journals and annual publications, although only approximately one fifteenth of these is available to students at any given time. The ''Bibliothèque'' is also the hub of the Documentary Service which maintains 18,000 press dossiers on a wide range of sub-topics, and which each years abstracts and indexes some 10,000 articles from 1,200 periodicals each year.{{ref|Biblio}} In 1982, the [[National Ministry of Education (France)|National Ministry of Education]] made the ''Bibliothèque'' the Centre for Acquisition and Dissemination of Scientific and Technical Information in the field of [[political science]], and since 1994, it has been the antenna associated with ''[[Bibliothèque Nationale de France]]''.{{ref|Sciences-Po-Paris}} ''Bibliothèque de Sciences Po'' is also the main French partner in the [[International Bibliography of the Social Sciences]], which is based at the [[London School of Economics]].{{ref|IBSS}}

'''Jacques René Chirac''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ʒ|ɑː|k|_|ʃ|ɨ|ˈ|r|æ|k}}; {{IPA-fr|ʒɑk ʃiʁak}}; born 29 November 1932) is a French politician who served as [[President of France]] from 1995 to 2007. He previously served as [[Prime Minister of France]] from 1974 to 1976 and from 1986 to 1988 (making him the only person to hold the position of Prime Minister twice under the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]]), and as [[List of mayors of Paris|Mayor of Paris]] from 1977 to 1995.

Chirac was briefly a Communist in his late teens. After completing his studies of the [[DEA (former French degree)|DEA]]'s degree at the [[Institut d'études politiques de Paris]], a term at [[Harvard University]] and the [[École nationale d'administration]] (ENA), Chirac began his career as a high-level civil servant, and soon entered politics. He subsequently occupied various senior positions, including [[Minister of Agriculture (France)|Minister of Agriculture]], [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]], Prime Minister, [[Mayor of Paris]], and finally [[President of the French Republic]].

Chirac's internal policies included lower tax rates, the removal of [[price controls]], strong punishment for crime and terrorism, and business [[privatisation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/1997/07/15/chirac.t.php Privatization Is Essential, Chirac Warns Socialists: Resisting Global Currents, France Sticks to Being French], ''International Herald Tribune''&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued for more socially responsible [[economic policies]], and was elected in 1995 after campaigning on a platform of healing the &quot;social rift&quot; (''fracture sociale'').&lt;ref name=Bonjour&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonjourlafrance.net/france-history/jacques-chirac.htm |title=Jacques Chirac President of France from 1995–2007 |publisher=Bonjourlafrance.net |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After less statist policy when he was Prime Minister (1986–1988), he changed his method. Then, his economic policies, based on ''[[dirigisme]]'', state-directed ideals, stood in opposition to the ''[[laissez-faire]]'' policies of the United Kingdom, which Chirac famously described as &quot;[[Anglosphere|Anglo-Saxon]] [[neoliberalism|ultraliberalism]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite book|last=Giavazzi|first=Francesco|coauthors=Alberto Alesina|year=2006|title=The Future of Europe: Reform Or Decline|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chirac is the second-longest serving President of France (two full terms, the first of seven years and the second of five years), after [[François Mitterrand]]. As President, he also served as an ''[[ex officio]]'' [[Co-Prince of Andorra]] and Grand Master of the French [[Légion d'honneur]].

On 15 December 2011, the Paris court declared him guilty of diverting public funds and abusing public confidence, and gave Chirac a two-year suspended prison sentence.

==Family, early life, education, and early career==
Chirac, born in the Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire clinic ([[5th arrondissement of Paris|Paris V&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;]]), is the son of Abel François Chirac (1893–1968), a successful executive for an aircraft company,&lt;ref name=Bonjour /&gt; and Marie-Louise Valette (1902–1973), a housewife. His great grandparents on both sides were [[peasant]]s, but his two grandfathers were teachers from [[Sainte-Féréole]] in Corrèze. According to Chirac, his name &quot;originates from the [[langue d'oc]], that of the troubadours, therefore that of poetry&quot;. He is a Roman Catholic.

Chirac was an only child (his elder sister, Jacqueline, died in infancy before his birth), and was educated in Paris at the [[Lycée Carnot]] and at the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]]. After his [[baccalauréat]], he served for three months as a sailor on a coal-transporter.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Chirac played [[rugby union]] for [[CA Brive|Brive]]'s youth team, and also played at university level. He played no. 8 and second row.&lt;ref name=Famous&gt;[http://wesclark.com/rrr/famous.html Famous Ruggers by Wes Clark and others]. Retrieved 19 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, he married [[Bernadette Chirac|Bernadette Chodron de Courcel]], with whom he had two daughters: Laurence (born 4 March 1958) and Claude (14 January 1962).

[[File:Jacques chirac corrèze 2.jpg|thumb|left|Chirac (right) in the 1960s]]
Inspired by General [[Charles de Gaulle]], Chirac started to pursue a civil service career in the 1950s. During this period, he joined the [[French Communist Party]], sold copies of ''[[L'Humanité]]'', and took part in meetings of a communist cell.&lt;ref name=d&gt;''[[France 3]]'', 12 November 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, he signed the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-inspired [[Stockholm Appeal]] for the abolition of [[nuclear weapons]] – which led him to be questioned when he applied for his first visa to the United States.&lt;ref name=e&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080608185416/http://www.humanite.fr/1995-05-08_Articles_-Jacques-Chirac-sabre-au-clair Jacques Chirac, sabre au clair]. ''L'Humanité'' 8 May 1995 (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, after graduating from &quot;[[Sciences Po]]&quot; (more formally known as the [[Paris Institute of Political Studies]]), he attended [[Harvard University]]'s summer school, before entering the ENA, the [[Grandes écoles|Grande école]] [[École nationale d'administration|National School of Administration]], which trains France's top civil servants, in 1957.

Chirac trained as a reserve military officer in [[armoured warfare|armoured cavalry]] at [[Saumur]], where he was ranked first in his year.&lt;ref name=f&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20061123131215/http://gouvernement.fr/acteurs/premier_ministre/histoire_chefs_gouvernement_28/jacques_chirac_55/ La biographie de Jacques Chirac]. Portail du Gouvernement – site du Premier ministre. 27 July 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He then volunteered to fight in the [[Algerian War]], using personal connections to be sent despite the reservations of his superiors. His superiors did not want to make him an officer because they suspected he had communist leanings.&lt;ref name=g&gt;Emmanuel Hecht and François Vey ''Chirac de A à Z, dictionnaire critique et impertinent'', A. Michel, 1995, ISBN 2226076646&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving the ENA in 1959, he became a civil servant in the Court of Auditors.

==Early political career, Cabinet Minister==
In April 1962, Chirac was appointed head of the personal staff of Prime Minister [[Georges Pompidou]]. This appointment launched Chirac's political career. Pompidou considered Chirac his [[protégé]], and referred to him as &quot;my bulldozer&quot; for his skill at getting things done. The nickname &quot;Le Bulldozer&quot; caught on in French political circles. Chirac still maintains this reputation. In 1995 an anonymous British diplomat said Chirac &quot;cuts through the crap and comes straight to the point...It's refreshing, although you have to put your seat belt on when you work with him&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

At Pompidou's suggestion, Chirac ran as a [[Gaullist]] for a seat in the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] in 1967. He was elected deputy for his home [[Corrèze]] ''département'', a stronghold of the left. This surprising victory in the context of a Gaullist ebb permitted him to enter the government as [[Minister of Social Affairs (France)|Minister of Social Affairs]]. Although Chirac was well-situated in de Gaulle's entourage, being related by marriage to the general's sole companion at the time of the [[Appeal of 18 June]] 1940, he was more of a &quot;Pompidolian&quot; than a &quot;Gaullist&quot;. When student and worker unrest rocked France in [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]], Chirac played a central role in negotiating a truce. Then, as state secretary of economy (1968–1971), he worked closely with [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]], who headed the ministry of economy and finance.

After some months in the ministry of relations with Parliament, Chirac's first high-level post came in 1972 when he became [[Minister of Agriculture (France)|Minister of Agriculture]] and Rural Development under Pompidou, who had been elected president in 1969, after de Gaulle retired. Chirac quickly earned a reputation as a champion of French farmers' interests, and first attracted international attention when he assailed U.S., [[West German]], and [[European Commission]] agricultural policies which conflicted with French interests.

On 27 February 1974, after the resignation of [[Raymond Marcellin]], Chirac was appointed [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]]. On 21 March 1974, he cancelled the [[SAFARI]] project due to privacy concerns after its existence was revealed by ''[[Le Monde]]''. From March 1974, he was entrusted by President Pompidou with preparations for the presidential election then scheduled for 1976. These elections were moved forward because of Pompidou's sudden death on 2 April 1974.

Chirac vainly attempted to rally Gaullists behind Prime minister [[Pierre Messmer]]. [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]] announced his candidacy in spite of the disapproval of the &quot;Pompidolians&quot;. Chirac and others published the ''call of the 43'' in favour of Giscard d'Estaing, the leader of the non-Gaullist part of the parliamentary majority. Giscard d'Estaing was elected as Pompidou's successor after France's most competitive election campaign in years. In return, the new president chose Chirac to lead the cabinet.

==Prime Minister (1974–1976)==
When [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing|Giscard]] became president, he nominated Chirac as [[Prime Minister of France|prime minister]] on 27 May 1974, in order to reconcile the &quot;Giscardian&quot; and &quot;non-Giscardian&quot; factions of the parliamentary majority. At the age of 41, Chirac stood out as the very model of the ''jeunes loups'' (&quot;young wolves&quot;) of French politics, but he was faced with the hostility of the &quot;Barons of Gaullism&quot; who considered him a traitor for his role during the previous presidential campaign. In December 1974, he took the lead of the [[Gaullist Party|Union of Democrats for the Republic]] (UDR) against the will of its more senior personalities.

As prime minister, Chirac quickly set about persuading the Gaullists that, despite the social reforms proposed by President Giscard, the basic tenets of Gaullism, such as national and European independence, would be retained. Chirac was advised by [[Pierre Juillet]] and [[Marie-France Garaud]], two former advisers of Pompidou. These two organised the campaign against Chaban-Delmas in 1974. They advocated a clash with Giscard d'Estaing because they thought his policy bewildered the conservative electorate. Citing Giscard's unwillingness to give him authority, Chirac resigned as Prime Minister in 1976. He proceeded to build up his political base among France's several conservative parties, with a goal of reconstituting the Gaullist UDR into a neo-Gaullist group, the Rally for the Republic (RPR).

==Osirak controversy==
At the invitation of [[Saddam Hussein]] (then vice-president of [[Iraq]], but ''de facto'' dictator), Chirac made an official visit to [[Baghdad]] in 1975. Saddam approved a deal granting French oil companies a number of privileges plus a 23 per cent share of Iraqi oil.&lt;ref name=h&gt;Taheri, Amir, [http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-taheri110402.asp &quot;The Chirac Doctrine: France’s Iraq-war plan&quot;], ''National Review Online'', 4 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this deal, France sold Iraq the [[Osirak]] MTR [[nuclear reactor]], a type designed to test nuclear materials.

The [[Israeli Air Force]] alleged that the reactor's imminent commissioning was a threat to its security, and pre-emptively bombed the Osirak reactor on 7 June 1981, provoking considerable anger from French officials and the United Nations Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/7/newsid_3014000/3014623.stm &quot;1981: Israel bombs Baghdad nuclear reactor&quot;], ''On this day – 7 June'', BBC News, Retrieved: 5 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Osirak deal became a controversy again in 2002–2003, when an international [[Multi-National Force – Iraq|military coalition]] led by the United States [[rationale for the Iraq War|invaded Iraq]] and forcibly removed Hussein's government from power. France led several other European countries in an effort to prevent the invasion. The Osirak deal was then used by parts of the American media to criticise the Chirac-led [[opposition to the Iraq War|opposition to starting a war in Iraq]],&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Glenn, [http://www.boston.com/news/packages/iraq/globe_stories/030203_chirac.htm Rebuilding Iraq], ''[[Boston Globe]]'', 2 March 2003&lt;/ref&gt; despite French involvement in the [[Gulf War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/2007/MR629.pdf |title=Out of Area or Out of Reach? European Military Support for Operations in Southwest Asia |format=PDF |accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mayor of Paris (1977–1995)==
After his departure from the cabinet, Chirac wanted to gain the leadership of the political right, in order to gain the French presidency in the future. The RPR was conceived as an electoral machine against President Giscard d'Estaing. Paradoxically, Chirac benefited from Giscard's decision to create the office of mayor in Paris, which had been in abeyance since the 1871 [[Paris Commune|Commune]], because the leaders of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] (1871–1940) feared that having municipal control of the capital would give the mayor too much power. In 1977, Chirac stood as a candidate against [[Michel d'Ornano]], a close friend of the president, and he won. As mayor of Paris, Chirac's political influence grew. He held this post until 1995.

Chirac supporters point out that, as mayor, he provided programs to help the elderly, people with disabilities, and single mothers, and introduced the street-cleaning [[Motocrotte]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/apr/12/worlddispatch.jonhenley|title=Merde most foul|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=12 April 2002|accessdate=29 July 2010  | first=Jon | last=Henley}}&lt;/ref&gt; while providing incentives for businesses to stay in Paris. His opponents contend that he installed &quot;clientelist&quot; policies.

===Accused of corruption, convicted===
Chirac has been named in several cases of alleged corruption that occurred during his term as mayor, some of which have led to [[felony]] convictions of some politicians and aides. However, a controversial judicial decision in 1999 granted Chirac immunity while he was president of France. He refused to testify on these matters, arguing that it would be incompatible with his presidential functions. Investigations concerning the running of Paris's city hall, the number of whose municipal employees jumped by 25% from 1977 to 1995 (with 2,000 out of approximately 35,000 coming from the Corrèze region where Chirac had held his seat as deputy), as well as a lack of financial transparency (''marchés publics'') and the communal debt, were thwarted by the legal impossibility of questioning him as president. The conditions of the [[privatisation]] of the Parisian water network, acquired very cheaply by the [[Compagnie Générale des Eaux|Générale]] and the [[Suez Environnement|Lyonnaise des Eaux]], then directed by [[Jérôme Monod]], a close friend of Chirac, were also criticised. Furthermore, the satirical newspaper ''[[Le Canard enchaîné]]'' revealed the astronomical &quot;food expenses&quot; paid by the Parisian municipality (€15 million a year according to the ''Canard''), expenses managed by [[Roger Romani]] (who allegedly destroyed all archives of the period 1978–1993 during night raids in 1999–2000). Thousands of people were invited each year to receptions in the Paris city hall, while many political, media and artistic personalities were hosted in private flats owned by the city.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Guarrigues, professor at the University of [[Orléans]] (and author of ''Les Scandales de la République. De Panama à l'Affaire Elf'', Robert Laffon, 2004), &quot;La dérive des affaires&quot; in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n° 313, October 2006, pp. 66–71 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chirac's immunity from prosecution ended in May 2007, when he left office as president. In November 2007 a preliminary charge of misuse of public funds was filed against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/chirac-faces-investigation-into-misuse-of-public-cash-759026.html|title=Chirac faces investigation into 'misuse of public cash'|date=22 November 2007|work=The Independent |location=London  |accessdate=6 July 2008  | first=John | last=Lichfield}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chirac is said to be the first former French head of state to be formally placed under investigation for a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.capital.fr/Actualite/Default.asp?source=RE&amp;numero=270226&amp;Cat=GEN|title=Le dossier judiciaire de Jacques Chirac s'alourdit|date=22 February 2008|work=Capital.fr|accessdate=6 July 2008|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 October 2009, a judge ordered Chirac to stand trial on [[embezzlement]] charges, dating back to his time as mayor of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/31/world/europe/31chirac.html|title=Frances Chirac Ordered to Face Trial|date=30 October 2009|author=Alan Cowell|work=The New York Times|accessdate=30 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 December 2011, Chirac was found guilty in two related cases, involving 19 totally or partially fake jobs created for his benefit by the RPR Party, which he led as Paris mayor from 1977 to 1995. He was convicted of embezzling public funds, abuse of trust, and illegal [[conflict of interest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/french-ex-president-chirac-convicted-of-corruption/2011/12/15/gIQAfp97vO_story.html|author=Edward Cody|title=Former French leader Jacques Chirac convicted of corruption for his Paris mayor days|date=16 December 2011|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Struggle for the right-wing leadership==
In 1978, he attacked the [[pro-European]] policy of [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] (VGE), and made a nationalist turn with the December 1978 [[Call of Cochin]], initiated by his counsellors [[Marie-France Garaud]] and [[Pierre Juillet]], which had first been called by Pompidou. Hospitalised in Cochin hospital after a crash, he declared that &quot;as always about the drooping of France, the pro-foreign party acts with its peaceable and reassuring voice&quot;. He appointed [[Ivan Blot]], an intellectual who would later join the [[National Front (France)|National Front]], as director of his campaigns for the [[European Parliament elections, 1979|1979 European election]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Slama&quot;&gt;[[:fr:Alain-Gérard Slama|Alain-Gérard Slama]], &quot;Vous avez dit bonapartiste?&quot; in ''L'Histoire'' n°313, October 2006, pp.60–63 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the poor results of the election, Chirac broke with Garaud and Juillet. His rivalry with Giscard d'Estaing intensified. Although it has been often interpreted by historians as the struggle between two rival French right-wing families (the [[Bonapartist]]s, represented by Chirac, and the [[Orleanist]]s, represented by VGE), both figures in fact were members of the Liberal, Orleanist tradition, according to historian Alain-Gérard Slama.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slama&quot;/&gt; But the eviction of the Gaullist Barons and of President VGE convinced Chirac to assume a strong neo-Gaullist stance.

Chirac made his first run for president against Giscard d'Estaing in the [[French presidential election, 1981|1981 election]], thus splitting the centre-right vote. He was eliminated in the first round with 18% of the vote. He reluctantly supported Giscard in the second round. He refused to give instructions to the RPR voters but said that he supported the incumbent president &quot;in a private capacity&quot;, which was almost like a ''de facto'' support of the [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]]'s (PS) candidate, [[François Mitterrand]], who was elected by a broad majority.

Giscard has always blamed Chirac for his defeat. He was told by Mitterrand, before his death, that the latter had dined with Chirac before the election. Chirac told the Socialist candidate that he wanted to &quot;get rid of Giscard&quot;. In his memoirs, Giscard wrote that between the two rounds, he phoned the RPR headquarters. He passed himself off as a right-wing voter by changing his voice. The RPR employee advised him &quot;certainly do not vote Giscard!&quot;. After 1981, the relationship between the two men became tense, with Giscard, even though he was in the same government coalition as Chirac, criticising Chirac's actions openly.

After the May 1981 presidential election, the right also lost the subsequent [[French legislative election, 1981|legislative election]] that year. However, as Giscard had been knocked out, Chirac appeared as the principal leader of the right-wing opposition. Due to his attacks against the economic policy of the Socialist government, he gradually aligned himself with prevailing economic liberal opinion, even though it did not correspond with Gaullist doctrine. While the far-right National Front grew, taking advantage of a [[proportional representation]] electoral law, he signed an electoral platform with the Giscardian (and more or less Christian Democrat) party [[Union for French Democracy]] (UDF).

==First &quot;cohabitation&quot; (1986–1988) and &quot;desert crossing&quot;==
[[File:Jacques Chirac mid-eighties.jpg|thumb|Chirac during his second term as Prime Minister]]
When the RPR/UDF right-wing coalition won a slight majority in the National Assembly in the [[French legislative election, 1986|1986 election]], Mitterrand (PS) appointed Chirac prime minister (though many in Mitterrand's inner circle lobbied him to choose [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]] instead). This unprecedented power-sharing arrangement, known as [[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]], gave Chirac the lead in domestic affairs. However, it is generally conceded that Mitterrand used the areas granted to the President of the Republic, or &quot;reserved domains&quot; of the Presidency, Defense and Foreign Affairs, to belittle his Prime Minister.

===Chirac's second ministry===
(20 March 1986 – 12 May 1988)
*'''Jacques Chirac''' – Prime Minister
*[[Jean-Bernard Raimond]] – Minister of Foreign Affairs
*[[André Giraud]] – Minister of Defence
*[[Charles Pasqua]] – Minister of the Interior
*[[Édouard Balladur]] – Minister of Economy, Finance, and Privatisation
*[[Alain Madelin]] – Minister of Industry, Tourism, Posts, and Telecommunications
*[[Philippe Séguin]] – Minister of Employment and Social Affairs
*[[Albin Chalandon]] – Minister of Justice
*[[René Monory]] – Minister of National Education
*[[François Léotard]] – Minister of Culture and Communications
*[[François Guillaume]] – Minister of Agriculture
*[[Bernard Pons]] – Minister of Overseas Departments and Territories
*[[Pierre Méhaignerie]] – Minister of Housing, Equipment, Regional Planning, and Transport
*[[André Rossinot]] – Minister of Relations with Parliament
*[[Michel Aurillac]] – Minister of Cooperation

Chirac's cabinet sold many public companies, renewing with the [[liberalisation]] initiated under [[Laurent Fabius]]'s Socialist government (1984–86 – in particular with Fabius' privatisation of the audiovisual sector, leading to the creation of [[Canal +]]), and abolished the [[solidarity tax on wealth]] (ISF), a symbolic tax on very high resources championed by Mitterrand's government. Elsewhere, the plan for university reform (plan Devaquet) caused a crisis in 1986 when a young man named [[Malik Oussekine]] (1964–1986) was killed by the police, leading to massive demonstrations and the proposal's withdrawal. It has been said during other student crises that this event strongly affected Jacques Chirac, who was hereafter careful about possible [[police violence]] during such demonstrations (i.e. maybe explaining part of the decision to &quot;promulgate without applying&quot; the [[First Employment Contract]] (CPE) after [[2006 labor protests in France|large student demonstrations against it]]).

One of his first acts concerning foreign policy was to call back [[Jacques Foccart]] (1913–1997), who had been de Gaulle's and his successors' leading counsellor for African matters, called by journalist [[Stephen Smith (journalist)|Stephen Smith]] the &quot;father of all &quot;networks&quot; on the continent, at the time [in 1986] aged 72.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;&quot;Naufrage de la [[Françafrique]] – Le président a poursuivi une politique privilégiant les hommes forts au pouvoir.&quot;, [[Stephen Smith (journalist)|Stephen Smith]] in ''L'Histoire'' n°313, October 2006 (special issue on Chirac), p.70 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacques Foccart, who had also co-founded the Gaullist ''[[Service d'Action Civique]]'' (SAC, dissolved by Mitterrand in 1982) along with Charles Pasqua, and who was a key component of the &quot;[[Françafrique]]&quot; system, was again called to the [[Elysée Palace]] when Chirac won the 1995 presidential election. Furthermore, confronted by [[anti-colonialism|anti-colonialist movements]] in [[New Caledonia]], Prime Minister Chirac ordered a military intervention against the separatists in the Ouvéa cave, leading to several tragic deaths. He allegedly refused any alliance with [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]'s ''Front National''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/04/24/1019441263037.html |title=Chirac labels 'racist' Le Pen as threat to nation's soul |work=The Age |location=Australia |date=25 April 2002 |accessdate=20 April 2010 | first=Harry | last=de Quetteville}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1988 presidential elections and afterwards===
Chirac ran against Mitterrand for a second time in the [[French presidential election, 1988|1988 election]]. He obtained 20 percent of the vote in the first round, but lost the second with only 46 percent. He resigned from the cabinet and the right lost the [[French legislative election, 1988|next legislative election]].

For the first time, his leadership over the RPR was challenged. [[Charles Pasqua]] and [[Philippe Séguin]] criticised his abandonment of Gaullist doctrines. On the right, a new generation of politicians, the &quot;renovation men&quot;, accused Chirac and Giscard of being responsible for the electoral defeats. In 1992, convinced a man could not become President whilst advocating anti-European policies, he called for a &quot;yes&quot; vote in the referendum on the [[Maastricht Treaty]], against the opinion of Pasqua, Séguin and a majority of the RPR voters, who chose to vote &quot;no&quot;.

While he still was mayor of Paris (since 1977), Chirac went to [[Abidjan]] (Côte d'Ivoire) where he supported [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny|President Houphouët-Boigny]] (1960–1993), although the latter was being called a &quot;thief&quot; by the local population. Chirac then declared that [[multiparty democracy|multipartism]] was a &quot;kind of luxury.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;&quot;Naufrage de la Françafrique – Le président a poursuivi une politique privilégiant les hommes forts au pouvoir.&quot;, Stephen Smith in ''L'Histoire'' n°313, October 2006 (special issue on Chirac), p.70 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the right won the [[French legislative election, 1993|1993 legislative election]]. Chirac announced that he did not want to come back as prime minister, suggesting the appointment of [[Edouard Balladur]], who had promised that he would not run for the presidency against Chirac in 1995. However, benefiting from positive polls, Balladur decided to be a presidential candidate, with the support of a majority of right-wing politicians. Chirac broke at that time with a number of friends and allies, including Charles Pasqua, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], etc., who supported Balladur's candidacy. A small group of &quot;fidels&quot; would remain with him, including [[Alain Juppé]] and [[Jean-Louis Debré]]. When Nicolas Sarkozy became President in 2007, Juppé was one of the few &quot;chiraquiens&quot; to serve in François Fillon's government.

==First term as President (1995–2002)==
[[Image:Clintonchirac.jpg|thumb|left|Chirac with [[Bill Clinton]] outside the [[Élysée Palace]] in Paris, June 1999]]

During the [[French presidential election, 1995|1995 presidential campaign]], Chirac criticised the &quot;sole thought&quot; (''[[pensée unique]]'') of [[neoliberalism]] represented by his challenger on the right and promised to reduce the &quot;social fracture&quot;, placing himself more to the center and thus forcing Balladur to [[Political radicalism|radicalise]] himself. Ultimately, he obtained more votes than Balladur in the first round (20.8 percent), and then defeated the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] candidate [[Lionel Jospin]] in the second round (52.6 percent).

Chirac was elected on a platform of tax cuts and job programs, but his policies did little to ease the labor strikes during his first months in office. On the domestic front, neo-liberal economic austerity measures introduced by Chirac and his conservative prime minister [[Alain Juppé]], including budgetary cutbacks, proved highly unpopular. At about the same time, it became apparent that Juppé and others had obtained preferential conditions for public housing, as well as other perks. At the year's end Chirac faced [[1995 strikes in France|major workers' strikes]] which turned itself, in November–December 1995, into a [[general strike]], one of the largest since May 1968. The demonstrations were largely pitted against Juppé's plan on the reform of pensions, and led to the dismissal of the latter.

Shortly after taking office, Chirac{{ndash}} undaunted by international protests by environmental groups{{ndash}} insisted upon the resumption of [[nuclear weapons and France|nuclear tests at Mururoa Atoll]] in [[French Polynesia]] in 1995, a few months before signing the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acronym.org.uk/a09comp.htm |title=Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty |publisher=Acronym.org.uk |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reacting to criticism, Chirac said, &quot;You only have to look back at 1935...There were people then who were against France arming itself, and look what happened.&quot; On 1 February 1996, Chirac announced that France had ended &quot;once and for all&quot; its nuclear testing, intending to accede to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

Elected as President of the Republic, he refused to discuss the existence of French military bases in Africa, despite requests by the Ministry of Defence and the ''[[Quai d'Orsay]]'' (Ministry of Foreign Affairs).&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot; /&gt; The French Army thus remained in Côte d'Ivoire as well as in [[Omar Bongo]]'s [[Gabon]].

[[Image:Bush and Chirac.jpg|thumb|Chirac and [[George W. Bush]] during the [[27th G8 summit]], 21 July 2001.]]

In 1997, Chirac dissolved parliament for early legislative elections in a gamble designed to bolster support for his conservative economic program. But instead, it created an uproar, and his power was weakened by the subsequent backlash. The Socialist Party (PS), joined by other parties on the left, soundly defeated Chirac's conservative allies, forcing Chirac into a new period of cohabitation with Jospin as prime minister (1997–2002), which lasted five years.

Cohabitation significantly weakened the power of Chirac's presidency. The French president, by a [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]], only controls foreign and military policy— and even then, allocation of funding is under the control of Parliament and under the significant influence of the prime minister. Short of dissolving parliament and calling for new elections, the president was left with little power to influence public policy regarding crime, the economy, and public services. Chirac seized the occasion to periodically criticise Jospin's government.

Nevertheless, his position was weakened by [[Corruption scandals in the Paris region|scandals about the financing of RPR by Paris municipality]]. In 2001, the left, represented by [[Bertrand Delanoë]] (PS), won over the majority in the town council of the capital. [[Jean Tiberi]], Chirac's successor at the Paris townhall, was forced to resign after having been put under investigations in June 1999 on charges of ''[[influence peddling|trafic d'influences]]'' in the [[HLM]]s of Paris affairs (related to the illegal financing of the RPR). Tiberi was finally expelled from the [[Rally for the Republic|RPR]], Chirac's party, on 12 October 2000, declaring to the ''[[Le Figaro|Figaro magazine]]'' on 18 November 2000: &quot;Jacques Chirac is not my friend anymore&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Rien ne va plus entre Chirac et Tiberi&quot;, ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 18 November 2000 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the publication of the [[Jean-Claude Méry|Méry video-tape]] by ''[[Le Monde]]'' on 22 September 2000, in which Jean-Claude Méry, in charge of the RPR's financing, directly accused Chirac of organizing the network, and of having been physically present on 5 October 1986, when Méry gave in cash 5 millions [[Franc]]s, which came from companies who had benefited from state deals, to [[Michel Roussin]], personal secretary (''directeur de cabinet'') of Chirac,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=101715 &quot;Un témoignage pour l'histoire&quot;], ''Le Monde'', 22 September 2000 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/recherche_breve/1,13-0,37-101887,0.html La suite du testament de Jean-Claude Méry], ''Le Monde'', 23 September 2000 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chirac refused to follow up his summons by judge [[Eric Halphen]], and the highest echelons of the French justice declared that he could not been inculpated while in functions.

During his two terms, he increased the Elysee Palace's total budget by 105 percent (currently €90&amp;nbsp;million, whereas 20 years ago it was the equivalent of €43.7&amp;nbsp;million). He doubled the number of presidential cars – nowadays there are 61 cars and seven scooters in the Palace's garage. He has hired 145 extra employees – the total number of the people he employed simultaneously was 963.

===Defence policy===
As the Supreme Commander of the French armed forces, he has reduced the French military budget, as did his predecessor.

==Second term as president (2002–2007)==
{{Main|Jacques Chirac's second term as President of France}}

At the age of 69, Chirac faced his fourth presidential campaign in 2002. He received just 20% of the vote in the first ballot of the [[French presidential elections, 2002|presidential elections]] in April 2002. It had been expected that he would face incumbent prime minister [[Lionel Jospin]] (PS) in the second round of elections; instead, Chirac faced controversial far right politician [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] of [[National Front (France)|National Front]] (FN) who came in 200,000 votes ahead of Jospin. All parties outside the National Front (except for ''[[Lutte ouvrière]]'') called for opposing Le Pen, even if it meant voting for Chirac. The 14-day period between the two rounds of voting was marked by demonstrations against Le Pen and slogans such as &quot;Vote for the crook, not for the fascist&quot; or &quot;Vote with a clothespin on your nose&quot;. Chirac won re-election by a landslide, with 82 percent of the vote on the second ballot. However, Chirac became increasingly unpopular during his second term. According to a July 2005 poll,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000085&amp;sid=aXp5XEjdZ3_k&amp;refer=europe |title=Europe |publisher=Bloomberg  |date=2 June 2005 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 32 percent judged Chirac favorably and 63 percent unfavorably. In 2006, ''[[The Economist]]'' wrote that Chirac &quot;is the most unpopular occupant of the Elysée Palace in the fifth republic's history.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;economistneeds&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8080753|title=What France needs|accessdate=5 August 2007|date=26 October 2006|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early term===
As the left-wing Socialist Party was in thorough disarray following Jospin's defeat, Chirac reorganised politics on the [[right-wing|right]], establishing a new party – initially called the Union of the Presidential Majority, then the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP). The RPR had broken down; A number of members had formed [[Eurosceptic]] breakaways. While the Giscardian liberals of the Union of French Democracy ([[Union for French Democracy|UDF]]) had moved to the right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080512001044/http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/archives.php?id=8465 More conservative infighting over links to French far right] [[Associated Press]] via ''Turkish Daily News''. 15 August 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The UMP won the [[French legislative election, 2002|parliamentary elections]] that followed the presidential poll with ease.

During an official visit to [[Madagascar]] on 21 July 2005, Chirac described the repression of the 1947 [[Malagasy uprising]], which left between 80,000 and 90,000 dead, as &quot;unacceptable&quot;.

Despite past opposition to state intervention the Chirac government approved a 2.8&amp;nbsp;billion euro aid package to troubled manufacturing giant [[Alstom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080509043726/http://www.iht.com/articles/2003/08/08/alstom_1.php|author=Eric Pfanner |title=France's §2.8&amp;nbsp;billion aid package unlikely to bring quick fix : Alstom bailout may be long haul |work=International Herald Tribune |date=8 August 2003 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2004, Chirac signed a [[trade agreement]] with PRC President [[Hu Jintao]] where Alstom was given one billion euro in contracts and promises of future investment in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200410/10/eng20041010_159619.html |title=People's Daily Online – France's Alstom, China ink $1.3b contracts |work=People's Daily  |date=10 October 2004 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assassination attempt===
On 14 July 2002, during [[Bastille Day]] celebrations, Chirac survived an assassination attempt by a lone gunman with a rifle hidden in a guitar case. The would-be assassin fired a shot toward the presidential [[motorcade]], before being overpowered by bystanders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/europe/newsid_2127000/2127946.stm Chirac escapes lone gunman's bullet], ''BBC'', 15 July 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The gunman, [[Maxime Brunerie]], underwent psychiatric testing; the violent far-right group with which he was associated, [[Unité Radicale]], was then administratively dissolved.

===Stroke===
In early September 2005, he suffered an event that his doctors described as a 'vascular incident'. It was reported as a 'minor stroke'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Willsher |first=Kim |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/1497612/Minor-stroke-puts-Chirac-in-hospital-but-he-hangs-on-to-reins-of-government.html |title=Minor stroke puts Chirac in hospital but he hangs on to reins of government |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London   |date=4 September 2005 |accessdate=20 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or a mini-stroke (also known as a [[transient ischemic attack]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-10722229.html |title=Belfast Telegraph |publisher=Highbeam.com |date=6 September 2005 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recovered and returned to his duties soon after.

===2005 referendum on the TCE===
{{See|Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe}}

On 29 May 2005, a [[referendum]] was held in France to decide whether the country should ratify the proposed treaty for a [[Constitution of the European Union]] (TCE). The result was a victory for the No campaign, with 55 percent of voters rejecting the treaty on a turnout of 69 percent, dealing a devastating blow to Chirac and the [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] party, as well as to part of the center-left which had supported the TCE.
&lt;!-- In an address to the nation, Chirac has declared that the new cabinet's top priority would be to curb the unemployment level, which consistently hovers above 10 percent, calling for a &quot;national mobilisation&quot; to that effect. WHICH ADRESS? No sources, and that is a rather usual statement for politicians --&gt;

===Foreign policy===
Along with [[Vladimir Putin]] (Chirac called Vladimir Putin &quot;a personal friend&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/15578042 |title=Europe's bear problem |date=25 February 2010 |work=The Economist }}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Hu Jintao]], and [[Gerhard Schröder]], Chirac emerged as a leading voice against [[George W. Bush]] in 2003 during the organization and deployment of the United States led [[Coalition of the willing|military coalition]] to [[Deposition (politics)|forcibly remove]] the then current government of [[Iraq]] controlled by the [[Ba'ath Party]] under the leadership of [[Saddam Hussein]] and resulted in the 2003–2011 [[Iraq War]]. Despite intense US pressure, Chirac threatened to veto, at that given point, a resolution in the [[UN Security Council]] that would authorise the use of military force to rid Iraq of alleged [[weapons of mass destruction]], and rallied other governments to his position. &quot;Iraq today does not represent an immediate threat that justifies an immediate war&quot;, Chirac said on 18 March 2003. Chirac was then the target of various American and British commentators supporting the decisions of Bush and [[Tony Blair]]. Future Prime Minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] acquired much of his popularity for his speech against the war at the United Nations (UN). However, following controversies concerning the CIA's [[black sites]] and [[Extraordinary rendition by the United States|extraordinary rendition]] program, the press revealed that French special services had cooperated with [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] at the same time that Villepin was countering [[US foreign policy]] at the UN headquarters in New York.

After [[Togo]]'s leader [[Gnassingbé Eyadéma]]'s death on 5 February 2005, Chirac gave him tribute and supported his son, [[Faure Gnassingbé]], who has since succeeded to his father.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot; /&gt;

On 19 January 2006, Chirac said that France was prepared to launch a [[nuclear warfare|nuclear strike]] against any country that sponsors a [[List of terrorist incidents|terrorist attack]] against French interests. He said his country's [[Force de frappe|nuclear arsenal]] had been reconfigured to include the ability to make a tactical strike in retaliation for terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/19/AR2006011903311.html Chirac: Nuclear Response to Terrorism Is Possible], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 20 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2006, the [[G8]] met to discuss international energy concerns. Despite the rising awareness of [[global warming]] issues, the G8 focuses on &quot;[[energy security]]&quot; issues. Chirac continues to be the voice within the G8 summit meetings to support international action to curb global warming and [[climate change]] concerns. Chirac warns that &quot;humanity is dancing on a [[volcano]]&quot; and calls for serious action by the world's leading industrialised nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cutco2.org/2006/07/chirac-is-not-in-favor-of-dancing-on.html Chirac is Not in Favor of Dancing on Volcanoes], on &quot;CutC02&quot;'s website, 17 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005 civil unrest and CPE protests===
{{See|2005 civil unrest in France |2006 labour protests in France}}

Following major [[2006 labour protests in France|student protests in spring 2006]], which followed [[2005 civil unrest in France|civil unrest]] in autumn 2005 after the death of two young boys in [[Clichy-sous-Bois]], one of the poorest French commune located in Paris' suburbs, Chirac retracted the proposed [[First Employment Contract]] (CPE) by &quot;promulgating [it] without applying it&quot;, an unheard-of – and, some claim, illegal – move destined to appease the protests while giving the appearance not to retract himself, and therefore to continue his support towards his Prime Minister [[Dominique de Villepin]].

===Flight tax===

Chirac requested the ''[http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/IMG/pdf/LandauENG1.pdf Landau-report]'' (published in September 2004) and combined with the ''[http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/IMG/pdf/rapportdugroupequadripartite.pdf Report of the Technical Group on Innovative Financing Mechanisms]'' formulated upon request by the Heads of State of Brazil, Chile, France and Spain (issued in December 2004), these documents present various opportunities for innovative financing mechanisms while equally stressing the advantages (stability and predictability) of tax-based models. [[UNITAID]] project was born. Today the organisation executive board is chaired by [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]].

===The Clearstream affair===
{{See|Clearstream}}

During April and May 2006, Chirac's administration was beset by a crisis as his chosen Prime Minister, Dominique de Villepin, was accused of asking [[Philippe Rondot]], a top level French [[espionage|spy]], for a secret investigation into Villepin's chief political rival, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], in 2004. This matter has been called the second [[Clearstream Affair]]. On 10 May 2006, following a Cabinet meeting, Chirac made a rare television appearance to try to protect Villepin from the scandal and to debunk allegations that Chirac himself had set up a Japanese bank account containing 300&amp;nbsp;million francs in 1992 as Mayor of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,542-2174662,00.html French farce], ''[[The Times]]'', 11 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Chirac said that &quot;The Republic is not a dictatorship of rumors, a dictatorship of calumny.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-2174839,00.html Caught in deep water: Chirac swims against a tide of scandal], ''The Times'', 11 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Announcement of intention not to seek a third term===
In a pre-recorded television broadcast aired on 11 March 2007, Jacques Chirac announced, in a widely predicted move, that he would not choose to seek a third term as France's President. &quot;My whole life has been committed to serving France, and serving peace&quot;, Chirac said, adding that he would find new ways to serve France after leaving office. He did not explain the reasons for his decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/03/12/europe/EU-POL-France-Chiracs-Future.php France's Chirac says he will not run for re-election] Associated Press, 11 March 2007. Retrieved: 11 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Chirac did not, during the broadcast, endorse any of the candidates running for election, but did devote several minutes of his talk to a plea against extremist politics that was considered a thinly disguised invocation to voters not to vote for [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] and a recommendation to [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] not to orient his campaign so as to include themes traditionally associated with Le Pen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/11/AR2007031101091.html Chirac Leaving Stage Admired and Scorned] by John Leicester, Associated Press, 11 March 2007. Retrieved: 11 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy over hijab==

French President Jacques Chirac declared his complete rejection of the wearing of the Islamic headscarf, or [[hijab]], by female Muslims in French schools and public corporations. He adds that he perceives a kind of hostility in the wearing of the hijab. Chirac stated that with banning the hijab, there will be more integration in French society. He has contributed in establishing a law that prohibits wearing the hijab and other religious symbols and manifestations in schools and public corporations. This has created a great controversy in France as some Muslims believe they are being discriminated against.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arabwestreport.info/?q=node/12158 (Arab West Report: Art. 28, Week 50/2003, 10 – 15 December)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life after presidency==
Shortly after leaving office, he launched the [[Fondation Chirac]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jyHbiQwT8A2VnasPh30A3G8kbt3w |title=Chirac launches foundation 'to awaken consciences' |agency=AFP   |date=8 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in June 2008. Since then it has been striving for peace through advocacy on five main programmes: 
conflict prevention, access to water and sanitation, access to quality medicines and healthcare, access to land resources, and preservation of cultural diversity. It supports field projects that involve local people and provide concrete and innovative solutions. Chirac chairs the jury for the [[Fondation Chirac Prize for Conflict Prevention|Prize for Conflict Prevention]] awarded every year by his foundation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondationchirac.eu/en/the-fondation-chirac-prize-for-conflict-prevention/ The Fondation Chirac Prize for Conflict Prevention]&lt;/ref&gt;.

He also became a lifetime member of the [[Constitutional Council of France]]. He sat for the first time in the Council on 15 November 2007, six months after leaving the French Presidency. Immediately after Sarkozy's victory, Chirac moved into a 180 square meters duplex on the Quai Voltaire in Paris lent to him by the family of former [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] Prime Minister [[Rafik Hariri]]. During the [[Didier Schuller]] affair, the latter accused Hariri of having participated to the illegal funding of the [[Rally for the Republic|RPR]]'s political campaigns, but the justice closed the case without further investigations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/actualite/politiques/250314.FR.php Chirac trouve un point de chute à Paris chez la famille Hariri], ''[[Libération]]'', 27 April 2007 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 April 2008, Chirac's office announced that he had undergone successful surgery to fit a [[pacemaker]]. In January 2009, it was reported that Chirac had been hospitalised after being attacked by his pet [[Maltese (dog)|Maltese]] poodle. According to Chirac's wife Bernadette, the dog, named Sumo, had a history of unpredictable and vicious behavior, and had previously been medicated with antidepressants in an attempt to control it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=President Chirac hospitalised after mauling by his clinically depressed poodle |publisher=[[Daily Mail]]'' (London) |date=21 January 2009 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1126136/Former-French-President-Chirac-hospitalised-mauling-clinically-depressed-poodle.html?ITO=1490 |first=Ian |last=Sparks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 March 2011, he went on trial for charges of corruption (the first former French head of state to stand trial since [[Philippe Pétain]], who surrendered and collaborated with Nazi Germany) involving the misuse of public money during his time as [[mayor of Paris]] (1977–1995).&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc trial opens&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12661446 | title=France: Jacques Chirac corruption trial opens | accessdate=8 March 2011 | date=7 March 2011 |publisher=BBC News   | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5x1Fr7GjO | archivedate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was accused of paying cronies and political allies for 28 jobs that did not exist.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc trial opens&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tele&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/8366721/Jacques-Chirac-trial-faces-further-delays.html | title=Jacques Chirac trial faces further delays | accessdate=8 March 2011 | date=7 March 2011 | publisher=The Telegraph | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5x1FyQ5W1 | archivedate=8 March 2011 | first=Henry | last=Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Chirac, nine others stood trial in two separate cases, one dealing with fictional jobs for 21 people and the other with jobs for the remaining seven.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc trial opens&quot; /&gt; France's current Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[Alain Juppé]], was sentenced to a 14-month suspended prison sentence for the same case in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC guilty 15 December&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=French ex-President Jacques Chirac guilty of corruption|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16194089|publisher=BBC  |accessdate=15 December 2011|date=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memoirs and popularity===
In Volume 2 of his memoirs published in June 2011, Chirac mocked his successor [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] as &quot;irritable, rash, impetuous, disloyal, ungrateful, and un-French&quot;.&lt;ref name=FE&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13710626 &quot;France election 2012: Chirac mocks Sarkozy in memoirs&quot;], BBC. 9 June 2011.

==In culture==
===Impact on French popular culture===
Because of Jacques Chirac's long career in visible government positions, he has often been parodied or caricatured: Young Jacques Chirac is the basis of a young, dashing bureaucrat character in the 1976 [[Asterix]] comic strip album ''[[Obelix and Co.]]'', proposing methods to quell Gallic unrest to elderly, old-style Roman politicians. Chirac was also featured in ''[[Le Bêbête Show]]'' as an overexcited, jumpy character.

Jacques Chirac is a favorite character of ''[[Les Guignols de l'Info]]'', a satiric latex [[puppet show]]. He was once portrayed as a rather likable, though overexcited, character; however, following the corruption allegations, he has been shown as a kind of dilettante and incompetent who pilfers public money and lies through his teeth. His character for a while developed a [[superhero]] alter ego, ''Super Menteur'' (&quot;Super Liar&quot;) in order to get him out of embarrassing situations. Because of his alleged improprieties, he was lambasted in a song ''Chirac en prison'' (&quot;Chirac in jail&quot;) by French punk band [[Les Wampas]], with a video clip made by the ''Guignols''.

===Portrayals in film===
His role is played by [[Charles Fathy]] in the [[Oliver Stone]] film ''[[W. (film)|W.]]''

'''Jean Sarkozy de Nagy-Bocsa''' (born 1 September 1986) is the son of the [[President of France]], [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] from his first marriage, to [[Nicolas Sarkozy#Marie-Dominique Culioli|Marie-Dominique Culioli]]. Jean is a regional councillor in the city of Neuilly-sur-Seine, France and registered as a 1st year Law student at [[Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne University]] in 2007. He is a backroom activist for his father's [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP), a center-right party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080306.wwfrance06/BNStory/International Globe and Mail], &quot;Setting his own course where his dad once trod, Jean Sarkozy, 21, has the instincts of a seasoned politician&quot;, Anita Elash, 6 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neuilly-sur-Seine mayorship==
Nicolas Sarkozy attempted to parachute David Martinon, his protégé  and presidential spokesman, into the mayorship of Neuilly-sur-Seine, the richest town in France, where the president had formerly served as mayor. It was seen as one of the UMP's safest seats because 86% of the voters supported Sarkozy in the 2007 presidential election.  Jean Sarkozy was asked to persuade the voters to support his father's choice. After a poll showed that Martinon was so unpopular that he would lose the election, Jean publicly broke rank and said it was impossible to continue backing his father's mayoral choice. He and other politicians from the president's centre-right UMP party decided to campaign on their own ticket.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/feb/12/france The Guardian 12 February 2008], &quot;Turmoil as 'Sarkoville' turns against French president in mayoral race: Sarkozy's choice offers to quit as he is so unpopular&quot;, Angelique Chrisafis, 12 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Martinon stepped down as the party's candidate for mayor. Jean Sarkozy announced he was running for office himself as the UMP candidate for regional councillor in the electoral district of Neuilly-Sud. He was born, brought up and now lives in Neuilly-Sud, which includes the Bagatelle quarter, a neighbourhood of 27,000 people, the richest part of Neuilly. He faced three other candidates, Marie Brannens from the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]], and candidates from the [[Democratic Movement (France)|Democratic Movement]] (MoDem) and the [[National Front (France)|Front National]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=lefigaro.fr |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2008/03/03/01002-20080303ARTFIG00428-jean-sarkozy-fils-de-president-en-campagne.php |title='&amp;#39;Le Figaro'&amp;#39;, &quot;Jean Sarkozy, Fils de President en Campagne&quot;, 3 March 2008 |publisher=Lefigaro.fr |date= |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==La Défense controversy==

In 2009 Jean was offered to become head of Epad, the development agency for [[La Défense]], just west of Paris. La Défense is an important office centre, with 43 high-rise buildings, and its development agency controls an annual budget of more than 1 billion euros. French and many international newspapers reported this as a new case of [[nepotism]]. Much criticism has been made about the obvious lack of academic qualities and professional experience for such a high position. An online petition against the nomination has been diffused in all of the major news outlets and receives some 10,000 signatures a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Auteur : Des habitants de La D&amp;eacute;fense inquiets |url=http://www.mesopinions.com/Jean-Sarkozy--renoncez-a-postuler-au-poste-de-president-de-l-EPAD-petition-petitions-fdc75d89c604d782a5b2198681c67f26.html |title=Pétition sur &quot;Jean Sarkozy, renoncez à postuler au poste de président de l'EPAD&quot; : Site de pétitions en ligne |publisher=Mesopinions.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009, a survey found that 64% of French people oppose the arrival of Sarkozy at the Epad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fr.reuters.com/article/topNews/idFRPAE59F05620091016 |title=64% des Français contre l'arrivée de Jean Sarkozy à l'Epad &amp;#124; À la Une &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Fr.reuters.com |date=2009-02-09 |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy prompted various ironic comments from the international press. The Daily Mail noted that &quot;when asked whether the President's son might be a bit young for such a relatively prestigious job, [EPAD's current president] responded using the traditional French political foil of quoting classic literature: 'In souls nobly born, valour does not depend upon age.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mail Foreign Service |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1219289/Sarkozy-criticised-keeping-family-giving-son-Jean-government-job.html |title=Sarkozy criticised for keeping it in the family after giving his son Jean a top government job &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2009-10-09 |accessdate=2011-04-17 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Times calls the nomination an &quot;astonishing act of nepotism by Nicolas Sarkozy&quot; and reminds that &quot;[Jean], who is repeating his second year of undergraduate law at the Sorbonne, after having repeated the first year, was elected to a Neuilly seat on the notoriously sleaze-ridden department council last year. He was immediately given the job of heading Dad's Union for a Popular Movement on the body.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://timescorrespondents.typepad.com/charles_bremner/2009/10/sarkozy-rules-okay.html ]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The President of [[Medef]] replied to these criticisms saying she believed it was &quot;fantastic that a young and motivated man&quot; may want to be at the head of the largest business district in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fr.reuters.com/article/topNews/idFRPAE59C06F20091013?pageNumber=3&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 |title=Jean Sarkozy reçoit l'appui de son père et de la droite &amp;#124; À la Une &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Fr.reuters.com |date=2009-02-09 |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Nicolas Sarkozy defended his son by saying that &quot;it's never good when someone is attacked in an excessive manner for no reason,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fr.reuters.com/article/topNews/idFRPAE59C06F20091013?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 |title=Jean Sarkozy reçoit l'appui de son père et de la droite &amp;#124; À la Une &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Fr.reuters.com |date=2009-02-09 |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; not long however after having been mocked by some French media for having fiercely underlined during an unrelated speech on high school reform that &quot;what matters in France to succeed no longer relates to birth privileges, rather, to succeed, it is important to work hard and to have demonstrated significant skills at school, at work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=liberation |url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xaspb1_sarkozy-pour-reussir-il-ne-faut-plu_news |title=Sarkozy: &quot;Pour réussir, il ne faut plus être bien né&quot; - une vidéo Nieuws &amp; Politiek |publisher=Dailymotion |date=2009-10-10 |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Sarkozy said he is not going to give up the position,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2009/10/14/pourquoi-jean-sarkozy-s-accroche-malgre-l-ampleur-de-la-polemique_1253690_823448.html |title=Pourquoi Jean Sarkozy s’accroche, malgré l’ampleur de la polémique |publisher=LeMonde.fr |date= |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and demanded on French television not to be judged on his name, but on his acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qc4gkj9PZc&amp;feature=fvw |title=Jean Sarkozy : first time in TV |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received the support of [[David Douillet]], a former champion of the world of [[Judo]], newly elected as a [[Chamber of Deputies of France|député]] under the banner of the UMP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualites/politique/20091020.OBS5183/david_douillet_defend_jean_sarkozy_et_le_maintien_du_bo.html |title=David Douillet défend Jean Sarkozy et le maintien du bouclier fiscal - Politique - Nouvelobs.com |publisher=Tempsreel.nouvelobs.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, finally due to mounting pressure, Jean Sarkozy had to renounce.

==Personal life==
Jean Sarkozy was born in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] and educated at the [[Lycée Pasteur]]. He married [[Jessica Sebaoun-Darty]] on 10 September 2008 at the Neuilly-sur-Seine city hall. She gave birth to their first child—a son, Solal Nicolas Marc-Andre—on 13 January 2010. His wife is the daughter of Marc-André Sebaoun and Isabelle Maruani (née Darty). Maruani is heiress to a major [[consumer electronics]] company, the [[Darty]] group.  He has denied reports that he intends to convert from Catholicism to Judaism, Sebaoun's religion.  The cartoonist [[Siné]] came under sharp criticism and was sacked from his magazine after accusing Jean Sarkozy of converting out of ambition and being sued by the [[International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism]] (LICRA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/05/world/europe/05france.html New York Times],&quot;A Scooter, a Sarkozy and Rancor Collide&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, ''[[Le Canard enchaîné]]'', a satirical weekly newspaper, reported that French police had gone to extraordinary lengths to try to find his scooter when it was stolen, including taking DNA samples from his helmet. The scooter was recovered in ten days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Anita Elash |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080306.wwfrance06/BNStory/International |title=Globe and Mail.

'''Jean-Pierre Raffarin''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃ pjɛʁ ʁafaʁɛ̃|-|Fr-Jean-Pierre_Raffarin.ogg}}; born 3 August 1948 in [[Poitiers]], Vienne) is a French conservative politician and [[French Senate|senator]] for [[Vienne]].

Jean-Pierre Raffarin served as the [[Prime Minister of France]] from 6 May 2002 to 31 May 2005, resigning after France's rejection of the [[French referendum on the European Constitution|referendum]] on the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Union draft constitution]]. However, after Raffarin resigned, he said that his decision was not based on the outcome of the vote. Opinion polls following his resignation suggested that Raffarin was one of France's least popular prime ministers since the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] was established in 1958. However, according to the book &quot;France: 1815–2003&quot;, written by Martin Evans and Emmanuel Godwin, Raffarin was &quot;a remarkably popular prime minister&quot; despite his ability &quot;to state the obvious and to make empty statements&quot;.

Raffarin is married to Anne-Marie Perrier (b. 1952 in Chamalières) and has a daughter, Fleur.

==Early life==
Born 3 August 1948, Raffarin grew up in [[Poitiers]] as the son of a prominent national figure: his father [[Jean Raffarin]] was a vice-minister of Agriculture in the government of [[Pierre Mendes-France]] (1954–1955).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Man in the News; A Leader to Lean On; Jean-Pierre Raffarin |first=John |last=Tagliabue |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/07/world/man-in-the-news-a-leader-to-lean-on-jean-pierre-raffarin.html |newspaper=New York Times |date=7 May 2002 |accessdate=8 November 2010 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied law at the [[University of Paris II: Panthéon-Assas|University of Paris II Panthéon-Assas]] and later graduated from [[ESCP Europe]] business school. He started his professional career in marketing.

In the 1970s, his first political commitment was in the association of [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]]'s young supporters. Defining himself as a &quot;''giscardien''&quot;, he joined the staff of [[Lionel Stoléru]], Secretary of state for Manual Workers and Immigration, and the [[Republican Party (France)|Republican Party]], the liberal-conservative component of the centre-right confederation the [[Union for French Democracy]] (UDF).

==Political career==

In the 1980s, he started a career in local politics in [[Poitou-Charentes]] region. With the support of [[René Monory]], the local political leader, he took the chair of the regional council in 1988.
Seven years later, he was elected senator of [[Vienne]] ''département''.

'''Political functions'''

===In government===
During the [[French presidential election, 1995|1995 presidential campaign]], while most UDF politicians supported [[Édouard Balladur]], he chose the winning candidacy of [[Jacques Chirac]]. In return, he was nominated Minister of Small and Medium-sized Companies, Commerce and Craft Industry in [[Alain Juppé]]'s cabinet (1995–1997).

At the same time, the pro-Chirac UDF members founded the [[Popular Party for French Democracy]]. Then, he returned in the Republican Party, became [[Liberal Democracy (France)|Liberal Democracy]] (DL) in 1997. He was vice-president of DL until 2002.

===Prime minister===
During the [[French presidential election, 2002|2002 presidential campaign]], he advocated the union of the right behind the incumbent President Chirac. After his re-election, Chirac wished to give a sign of political renewal. Furthermore, elected in a special second round by a majority of left-wing voters, he searched for a moderate to lead the cabinet and the [[French legislative election, 2002|June 2002 legislative campaign]]. Raffarin participated in the formation of the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP).

His political policies combined [[authority]] and moderate economical liberalism – that is, the support of [[laissez-faire]] economic policies. In 2003 he launched reforms of the public retirement scheme and of [[decentralisation]], which led to many strikes. During the summer of 2003 the country experienced an unusual [[European Heat Wave of 2003|heat wave]] which caused the death of nearly 15,000 people. The perceived late reaction of the government was blamed on his administration. In 2004 he began a reform of the French state-run health-care system.

Raffarin's governments were known for their internal quarrels with various ministers taking opposite positions in public. The alleged lack of authority of the Prime Minister was mocked by the media.

On 28 March 2004 the ruling [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] party suffered an important defeat during the [[French regional elections, 2004|regional elections]], with all but one ''[[List of regions in France|région]]'' out of 22 of mainland France going to the opposition ([[French Socialist Party|PS]], [[French Communist Party|PCF]], [[Les Verts]]). This was generally interpreted, including by Raffarin himself in his post-election speech, as &quot;a sign of distrust against the government from the electorate&quot;. On 30 March 2004 Jean-Pierre Raffarin tendered the resignation of his government to president Jacques Chirac, who immediately re-appointed him prime minister, with the delegation to form a new government. This major cabinet reshuffle removed some of its most controversial ministers like [[Luc Ferry]] (education) or [[Jean-François Mattei]] (health).

===Resignation===
Raffarin's resignation was accepted by President Chirac on 30 May 2005, after the &quot;no&quot; victory at the [[European Constitution]] referendum, and he was replaced as Prime Minister by [[Dominique de Villepin]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4595423.stm |title=De Villepin appointed French PM  |date=31 May 2005 |publisher=BBC News   |accessdate=8 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 September 2005, he was elected Senator in the Vienne ''département''. Speculation were that he could eventually try to become [[List of Presidents of the French Senate|President of the Senate]] or President of the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] if Nicolas Sarkozy won the [[French presidential election, 2007|2007 presidential election]]. He became one of the Vice Presidents of the UMP in 2007. In September 2008, he sought the Senate UMP fraction’s investiture to become President of the Senate, but was defeated by [[Gérard Larcher]].

Raffarin is Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur ([[Legion of Honour]]) and Grand-Croix de l'ordre national du Mérite (National Order of Merit).

===International policies===
In September 2004 the US conservative [[blogosphere]] erupted with criticism of France when a [[New York Post]] opinion piece claimed that ''[[Le Figaro]]'' reported that Raffarin said &quot;the Iraqi insurgents are our best allies&quot;. There is no trace of this quote in ''Le Figaro'', and the opinion piece is no longer available from the NYP website.
During a state visit to China on 21 April 2005 he avoided opposing the new [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China|&quot;anti-secession&quot; law on Taiwan]], stating that &quot;The anti-secession law is completely compatible with the position of France&quot; and &quot;The position of France has always been to 'one China' and we will remain attached to this position&quot;. On the embargo on weapons, he stated that &quot;France continues to ask for a lifting of the embargo, and does not see what could lead the European Council to change position on that question&quot;. [http://sg.news.yahoo.com/050423/1/3s3pn.html] [http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=9677&amp;t=1&amp;c=1]

==Raffarinades==
Jean-Pierre Raffarin was often teased for his optimistic [[aphorism]]s, known colloquially and ironically as ''raffarinades'', the best known being ''La route est droite, mais la pente est forte'' (&quot;The road is straight, but the slope is steep&quot;). Some consider that the word ''raffarinade'' was created in reference to the other French word ''mazarinade''. However, ''mazarinade'' refers to the songs that the ''frondeurs'' (French revolutionaries during the ''Régence'' of Queen Anne – Archduchess of Austria – and chief minister [[Cardinal de Mazarin]], before king Louis XIV's personal reign) sang to mock the unpopular chief minister.

Raffarin also tried his English prior to the referendum on the European draft Constitution but this turned out to be an ill-advised idea, as shown in this famous excerpt [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4118142947508150872&amp;q=raffarin&amp;pl=true] from his speech: &quot;Win the yes need the no to win against the no.&quot; The referendum itself was enventually nicknamed ''le Raffarindum'' by its opponents while ''[[Journée de solidarité envers les personnes âgées]]'' (''Day of solidarity with the elderly'') is sometimes referred to as ''la Saint-Raffarin'' by discontented workers (following a decision by Raffarin, French workers are supposed to work on [[Whit Monday]] for free).

The '''Minister for the Economy, Industry and Employment''' (''Ministre de l'économie, de l'industrie et de l'emploi''), or '''Minister of Finance''' for short, is one of the most prominent positions in the [[French government ministers|cabinet]] of France after the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]].

It now has a colleague of equal rank: the '''Minister for the Budget, Public Accounts, the Civil Service and State Reform''' (''Ministre du budget, des comptes publics, de la fonction publique et de la réforme de l'État''). This ministry is responsible for the government real estate strategy through [[Service France Domaine]].

The exact title of the minister has varied throughout time; it may not always include &quot;economy&quot;, &quot;industry&quot;, or &quot;finances&quot;.

The Minister oversees:
* the drafting of taxation laws by exercising direct authority over the Tax Policy Board (''Direction de la législation fiscale'') of the Department of Revenue (''[[:fr:Direction générale des impôts]]'');
* national funds and financial and economic system, especially with the Office of the Treasurer and Receiver General (''Direction générale du Trésor et de la politique économique''), not to be confused with the Public Treasury (''Trésor Public''), that is the Office of the Comptroller-General (''Direction générale de la comptabilité publique'') under the authority of the Minister of Budget);
* the development, regulation and control of economy including industry, tourism, small business, competition, and consumer security, and other matters excluding energy, industrial security, environmental affairs and transportations which are under the authority of the Ministre d’Etat, [[Minister for Ecology and Sustainable Planning and Development]];
* employment policies and career education.

By her authority above the financial assets of the State, the financial and economic national system and the taxation rules, the Minister is allowed to represent France in the European Union council of the minister of the Economy and Finance (ECOFIN).

See: http://www.minefi.gouv.fr/directions_services/sircom/ministere/organigramme_minefe.htm

The current Minister for the Economy, Industry and Employment is [[Francois Baroin]].

== The Minister for the Budget, Public Accounts, the Civil Service and State Reform ==

The Minister for the Budget, Public Accounts, the Civil Service and State Reform supervises:
* the preparation of the finance law ([[budget]]) (with the help of his colleague '''Minister for the Economy, Industry and Employment''' in taxation ruling matters, he requires the Board for Tax Policy of the ''[[Direction générale des impôts]]''), which is then submitted to [[Parliament of France|Parliament]] for [[law|amendment]] and final approval;
* the [[taxation]] system :
* the accounting of the State and all public bodies (by the ''[[Trésor public|''Direction générale de la comptablilité publique]]'').

See: http://www.budget.gouv.fr/

The [[Taxation in France|French taxation]] system is supervised by three separate board:
* the ''[[Direction générale des impôts]]'' for tax evaluation and collecting some taxes such as [[VAT]] or [[corporate tax]];
* the ''[[Direction générale de la comptablilité publique]]'' (or ''[[Direction générale de la comptablilité publique|Trésor Public]]'') for collecting some other taxes calculated by the ''[[Direction générale des impôts]]'' including [[income tax]] or local taxes based on Estate locative value.
* the ''[[Direction générale des douanes et des droits indirects]]'' for [[customs]], for tax on petrol and fuels and for [[indirect tax|special indirect taxes]] such as taxes on alcohol, tobacco, etc.);
The taxation [[information system]] are being modernised by the so-called [[Copernic tax project]].


By delegation of the Prime Minister, he supervises also the Public Services (essentially statutes and salaries of the State, local and hospital Public Services) and the modernisation of the State (including computing means).

He is responsible with their colleagues for Health, Youth and Sport and for Labour, Labour Relations and Solidarity of the equilibrium of social accounts.

See: http://www.minefi.gouv.fr/directions_services/sircom/ministere/organigramme_mbcpfp.htm

The current Minister for the Budget, Public Accounts, the Civil Service and the Reform of the State is [[François Baroin]].

==Location==
The Ministry of Finances is situated in [[Bercy]], a district in [[Paris]] (in the [[XIIe arrondissement|12th arrondissement]]). The building extends to the [[Seine River]], where there is an embarcadero with fast river boats for faster liaisons to other government agencies.

That is why the French media often refer to it as simply &quot;Bercy&quot;. The sentence ''the Bercy Fortress'' (''la forteresse de Bercy'') refers to the Ministry as a dark department with obtuse [[civil servants]], especially of high rank. That is emphasized by the impressive look of the building.

For evident practical reasons, the two ministers share the building and some common services that were under the former ministry of Economy, Finances and Industry.

* The general interior security of the country, with respect to criminal acts or natural catastrophes
** including the major law-enforcement forces (see [[Police in France]])

* relations between the central government and local governments;
* [[logistics]] and organization of political [[election]]s, at the national and prefectoral levels (but the results of the elections are overseen by the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] or the administrative courts);
* regulation of immigration and preventing illegal immigration;
* integration of legal immigrants (professionally, linguistically, housing, etc.);
* all [[département]]al ''[[préfet]]s'' and sub-prefects are subordinate to the Minister of the Interior.

[[Image:Place Beauvau entrance dsc00801.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The entrance to the Ministry in Place Beauvau is guarded by one gendarme (to the left) and one policewoman (to the right). Joint gendarmerie/police guard duty was seen as a way to bridge the differences between the services.]]

While the ministry of the Interior supervises police forces, it does not supervise criminal enquiries; criminal enquiries are conducted under the supervision of the [[judiciary]].

The Ministry's headquarters are located on the '''place Beauvau''', facing the [[Élysée Palace]]. &quot;Place Beauvau&quot; is often used as a metonym for the ministry.

The current Minister of the Interior is [[Claude Guéant]].

'''Neuilly-sur-Seine''' ({{IPA-fr|nøji syʁ sɛn}}) is a [[Communes of France|''commune'']] in the western suburbs of [[Paris]], [[France]]. It is located {{convert|6.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the [[Kilometre Zero|center of Paris]].

Although Neuilly is technically a [[banlieue|suburb]] of [[Paris]], it is immediately adjacent to the city and directly extends it.  The area is composed of mostly wealthy, select residential neighbourhoods, as well as the [[headquarter]]s of many [[corporation]]s. It is often lumped together with some areas of the neighbouring [[XVIe arrondissement|16th arrondissement]] of [[Paris]] as [[Auteuil-Neuilly-Passy]], a compendium of &quot;[[bourgeois]]&quot; (i.e., upscale) neighbourhoods in Paris.

==History==
The origins of Neuilly-sur-Seine's name are quite confused and controversial. Originally, Neuilly was a small hamlet under the jurisdiction of Villiers, a larger settlement mentioned in medieval sources as early as 832 and now absorbed by the commune of [[Levallois-Perret]]. It was not until 1222 that the little settlement of Neuilly, established on the banks of the [[Seine]], was mentioned for the first time in a [[charter]] of the [[Saint-Denis Basilica|Abbey of Saint-Denis]]: the name was recorded in [[Medieval Latin]] as ''Portus de Lulliaco'', meaning &quot;Port of Lulliacum&quot;. In 1224 another charter of Saint-Denis recorded the name as ''Lugniacum''. In a sales contract dated 1266 the name was also recorded as ''Luingni''.

In 1316, however, in a ruling of the ''[[parlement]]'' of [[Paris]], the name was recorded as ''Nully'', quite a different name from those recorded before. In a document dated 1376 the name was again recorded as ''Nulliacum'' (the Medieval Latin version of ''Nully''). Then in the following centuries the name recorded alternated between ''Luny'' and ''Nully'', and it is only after 1648 that the name was definitely set as ''Nully''. The name spelt ''Neuilly'' after the [[Académie française|French Academy]] standard of pronunciation of the ''ill'' as a ''y'' (See IPA at the top).

Various explanations and etymologies have been proposed to explain these discrepancies in the names of Neuilly recorded over the centuries. It seems most plausible to consider that the original name of Neuilly was ''Lulliacum'' or ''Lugniacum'', and that it was only later corrupted into ''Nulliacum'' / ''Nully''. Some interpret ''Lulliacum'' or ''Lugniacum'' as meaning &quot;estate of Lullius (or Lunius)&quot;, probably a [[Gallo-Roman]] landowner. This interpretation is based on the many placenames of France made up of the names of Gallo-Roman landowners and suffixed with the traditional placename suffix &quot;-acum&quot;. However, other researchers object that it is unlikely that Neuilly owes its name to a Gallo-Roman [[patronym]], because during the Roman occupation of [[Gaul]] the area of Neuilly was inside the large [[Forest of Rouvray]], of which the [[Bois de Boulogne]] is all that remains today, and was probably not settled yet.

These researchers contend that it is only after the fall of the Roman Empire and the Germanic invasions that the area of Neuilly was deforested and settled. Thus, they think that the name ''Lulliacum'' or ''Lugniacum'' comes from the ancient Germanic word ''lund'' meaning &quot;forest&quot;, akin to [[Old Norse]] ''lundr'' meaning &quot;grove&quot;, to which the placename suffix &quot;-acum&quot; was added. The Old Norse word ''lundr'' has indeed left many placenames across Europe, such as the city of [[Lund]] in Sweden, the Forest of the Londe in [[Normandy]], or the many English placenames containing &quot;lound&quot;, &quot;lownde&quot;, or &quot;lund&quot; in their name, or ending in &quot;-land&quot;. However, this interesting theory fails to explain why the &quot;d&quot; of ''lund'' is missing in ''Lulliacum'' or ''Lugniacum''.

Concerning the discrepancy in names over the centuries, the most probable explanation is that the original name ''Lulliacum'' or ''Lugniacum'' was later corrupted into ''Nulliacum'' / ''Nully'' by inversion of the consonants, perhaps under the influence of an old Celtic word meaning &quot;swampy land, boggy land&quot; (as was the land around Neuilly-sur-Seine in ancient times) which is found in the name of many French places  anciently covered with water, such as Noue, Noë, Nouan, Nohant, etc. Or perhaps the consonants were simply inverted under the influence of the many settlements of France called Neuilly (a frequent placename whose etymology is completely different from the special case of Neuilly-sur-Seine).

Until the [[French Revolution]], the settlement was often referred to as ''Port-Neuilly'', but at the creation of [[commune in France|French communes]] in 1790 the &quot;Port&quot; was dropped and the newly born commune was named simply ''Neuilly''.

On 1 January 1860, the city of Paris was enlarged by annexing neighboring communes. On that occasion, a part of the territory of Neuilly-sur-Seine was annexed by the city of Paris, and forms now the neighborhood of [[Ternes]], in the [[XVIIe arrondissement|17th arrondissement]] of Paris.

On 11 January 1867, part of the territory of Neuilly-sur-Seine was detached and merged with a part of the territory of [[Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine|Clichy]] to create the commune of [[Levallois-Perret]].

On 2 May 1897, the commune name officially became Neuilly-sur-Seine (meaning &quot;Neuilly upon [[Seine]]&quot;), in order to distinguish it from the many communes of France also called Neuilly. However, most people continue to refer to Neuilly-sur-Seine as simply &quot;Neuilly&quot;. During the [[1900 Summer Olympics]], it hosted the [[Basque pelota at the 1900 Summer Olympics|basque pelota]] events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1900/PEL/mens-two-man-teams-with-cesta.html Sports-reference.com Summer Olympics Paris 14 June 1900 men's basque pelota two-teams results.] Accessed 14 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Hospital of Paris]] was founded in 1906.

In 1919, the [[Treaty of Neuilly]] was signed with [[Bulgaria]] in Neuilly-sur-Seine to conclude its role in [[World War I]].

In 1929, the [[Bois de Boulogne]], which was hitherto divided between the communes of Neuilly-sur-Seine and [[Boulogne-Billancourt]], was annexed in its entirety by the city of Paris.

==Personal life==
===Family background===
{{Main|Family history of Nicolas Sarkozy}}
Sarkozy is the son of Pál István Ernő Sárközy de Nagy-Bócsa&lt;ref&gt;It is the &quot;westernised&quot;, or &quot;internationalised&quot;, version of his Hungarian name, in which the given name is put first (whereas in Hungarian given names come last), and the French aristocratic particle &quot;de&quot; is used instead of the Hungarian aristocratic ending &quot;-i&quot;. This &quot;westernisation&quot; of Hungarian names is frequent, particularly for people with an aristocratic name.  Check for example the leader of Hungary from 1920 to 1944, whose Hungarian name is nagybányai Horthy Miklós, but who is known in English as [[Miklós Horthy|Miklós Horthy de Nagybánya]]. The French name of Pál Sárközy de Nagy-Bócsa from 1948 is Paul Étienne Arnaud Sarközy de Nagy-Bocsa, where the given name Pál has been translated into Paul in French, and the acute accents on the &quot;a&quot; of Sarközy and the &quot;o&quot; of Bocsa were dropped as these letters never carry an acute accent (''accent aigu'') in French.  The [[diaeresis (diacritic)|trema]] on the &quot;o&quot; of Sárközy was kept, probably because French typewriters allow this combination, whereas it is impossible to write &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot; with an acute accent using a French typewriter.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-hu|&lt;!--Leave the lower case 'n' please, it's not an error!--&gt;nagybócsai Sárközy Pál}} {{IPA-hu|nɒɟ͡ʝboːt͡ʃɒi ʃaːrkøzi paːl||Pal_sarkozy.ogg}}; in some sources ''Nagy-Bócsay Sárközy Pál István Ernő''),&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/15/opinion/15tue4.html?_r=2&amp;th&amp;emc=th&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin | title = The New French President's Roots Are Worth Remembering | date =15 May 2007 | accessdate=28 September 2008 | work=The New York Times | first=Serge | last=Schmemann}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[aristocracy|aristocrat]], and Andrée Jeanne &quot;Dadu&quot; Mallah (b.

===Early life===
During Sarkozy's childhood, his father allegedly refused to give his wife's family any financial help, even though he had founded his own advertising agency and had become wealthy.  The family lived in a mansion owned by Sarkozy's grandfather, Benedict Mallah, in the [[17th Arrondissement]] of Paris. The family later moved to [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], one of the wealthiest [[Commune in France|communes]] of the [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]] ''[[Régions in France|région]]'' immediately west of the 17th Arrondissement just outside of Paris.  According to Sarkozy, his staunchly [[Gaullist]] grandfather was more of an influence on him than his father, whom he rarely saw.  Sarkozy was, accordingly, raised Catholic.&lt;ref name=BBCProf/&gt;

Sarkozy said that being abandoned by his father shaped much of who he is today. He also has said that, in his early years, he felt inferior in relation to his wealthier and taller classmates.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''see Catherine Nay's semi-official biography''&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;What made me who I am now is the sum of all the humiliations suffered during childhood&quot;, he said later.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Education===
Sarkozy was enrolled in the ''Lycée Chaptal'', a well regarded public middle and high school in Paris's [[8th arrondissement of Paris|8th arrondissement]], where he failed his ''[[Education in France#Secondary education|sixième]]''. His family then sent him to the ''Cours Saint-Louis de Monceau'', a private Catholic school in the 17th arrondissement, where he was reportedly a mediocre student,&lt;ref&gt;''Un pouvoir nommé désir'', Catherine Nay, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; but where he nonetheless obtained his ''[[baccalauréat]]'' in 1973. He enrolled at the ''[[University of Paris X: Nanterre|Université Paris X Nanterre]]'', where he graduated with an MA in [[Private law]], and later with a [[DEA (former French degree)|DEA]] degree in Business law. Paris X Nanterre had been the starting place for the [[May '68]] student movement and was still a stronghold of [[leftist]] students. Described as a quiet student, Sarkozy soon joined the right-wing student organization, in which he was very active. He completed his military service as a part time Air Force cleaner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsnours.com/2008/07/le-service-mili.html |title=Le service militaire de Sakozy|publisher=Nousnours |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating, he entered the ''[[Paris Institute of Political Studies|Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris]]'', better known as Sciences Po, (1979–1981) but failed to graduate&lt;ref&gt;Augustin Scalbert, [http://www.rue89.com/2007/09/18/un-soupcon-de-vantardise-sur-les-cv-ministeriels Un soupçon de vantardise sur les CV ministériels], ''[[Rue 89]]'', 18 September 2007 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to an insufficient command of the English language.&lt;ref name=&quot;cath_nay&quot;&gt;See Catherine Nay's semi-official biography&lt;/ref&gt; After passing the [[bar (law)|bar]], he became a lawyer specializing in [[business law|business]] and [[family law]],&lt;ref name=&quot;cath_nay&quot;/&gt; and was one of [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s top French advocates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualites/international/europe/20090629.OBS2316/berlusconi__le_bon_nicolas_sarkozy_a_ete_mon_avocat.html |title=Berlusconi : le &quot;bon Nicolas Sarkozy&quot; a été mon avocat |work=Le Nouvel Observateur |location=France |date=29 June 2009|accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2009/06/sezioni/politica/berlusconi-varie-2/berlusconi-russia/berlusconi-russia.html |title=Corfù, il vertice del disgelo &quot;Riparte collaborazione Nato-Russia&quot; Il Cavaliere: &quot;Mandai il mio avvocato Sarkozy da lui per la Georgia...&quot; |publisher=Repubblica |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unionesarda.ilsole24ore.com/Articoli/Articolo/131694 |title=Berlusconi al vertice Nato-Russia &quot;Quando mandai l'avvocato Sarkozy&quot; |publisher=L'UNIONE SARDA.it|date=20 November 1948 |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriages===
====Marie-Dominique Culioli====
Sarkozy married his first wife, Marie-Dominique Culioli, on 23 September 1982; her father was a [[pharmacist]] from [[Vico, Corse-du-Sud|Vico]] (a village north of [[Ajaccio]], Corsica). They had two sons, Pierre (born in 1985), now a hip-hop producer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Indrisek |first=Scott |url=http://blog.rhapsody.com/2008/01/pierre-sarkozy-hip-hop-producer.html |title=Pierre Sarkozy: Hip-Hop Producer|publisher=Rhapsody Blog|date=7 January 2008|accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jean Sarkozy|Jean]] (born in 1986) now a local politician in the city of Neuilly-sur-Seine where Sarkozy started his own political career. Sarkozy's best man was the prominent right-wing politician [[Charles Pasqua]], later to become a political opponent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,476255-2,00.html Sarkozy Closes in on his Goal: Ambition and Honesty on the French Campaign Trail] Spiegel.de, 4 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Sarkozy divorced Culioli in 1996, after they had been separated for several years.

====Cécilia Ciganer-Albéniz====
As mayor of [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], Sarkozy met former fashion model and public relations executive [[Cécilia Attias|Cécilia Ciganer-Albéniz]] (great-granddaughter of composer [[Isaac Albéniz]] and daughter of a Moldovan father), when he officiated at her wedding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cécilia Sarkozy: The First Lady vanishes|date=24 June 2007|work=The Independent |location=UK |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/europe/ccilia-sarkozy-the-first-lady-vanishes-454247.html | location=London | accessdate=31 March 2010 |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=December 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; to television host [[Jacques Martin (TV host)|Jacques Martin]]. In 1988, she left her husband for Sarkozy, and divorced Martin one year later. Sarkozy married her in October 1996, with witnesses [[Martin Bouygues]] and [[Bernard Arnault]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netglimse.com/celebs/pages/cecilia_sarkozy/index.shtml |title=Cecilia Sarkozy Biography|publisher=NetGlimse.com |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have one son, Louis, born 23 April 1997.

Between 2002 and 2005, the couple often appeared together on public occasions, with Cécilia Sarkozy acting as the chief aide for her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wyatt |first=Caroline |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6656717.stm |title=Sarkozy soap opera grips Paris |publisher=BBC News  |date=15 May 2007 |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 May 2005, however, the Swiss newspaper ''[[Le Matin (Switzerland)|Le Matin]]'' revealed that she had left Sarkozy for French-Moroccan national [[Richard Attias]], head of [[Publicis]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huliq.com/38585/nicolas-sarkozy-divorce-official |title=Nicolas Sarkozy divorce official|publisher=HULIQ|date=18 October 2007 |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were other accusations of a private nature in ''Le Matin'', which led to Sarkozy [[lawsuit|suing]] the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaljournalist.org/stories/2005/12/01/french-roast-served-up-american-style/ |title=Globaljournalist.org |publisher=Global Journalist |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, he was said to have had an affair with a journalist of ''[[Le Figaro]]'', [[Anne Fulda]].&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph3&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=The Daily Telegraph |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=SNKICWL0BRPGRQFIQMGCFFWAVCBQUIV0?xml=/news/2006/02/19/wsark19.xml&amp;page=2|title=The Sarkozy saga|accessdate=12 August 2007 | location=UK | first=Kim | last=Willsher | date=19 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarkozy and Cécilia ultimately divorced on 15 October 2007, soon after his election as President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.forbes.com/afxnewslimited/feeds/afx/2007/10/18/afx4234519.html |title=French president Sarkozy separation is 'divorce' – official UPDATE|author=AFX News Limited|work=Forbes magazine |date=18 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal wealth===
Sarkozy declared to the [[Constitutional Council (France)|Constitutional Council]] a [[net worth]] of €2&amp;nbsp;million, most of the assets being in the form of [[life insurance]] policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |coauthor=AFP |title=L'homme qui valait 2 millions |trans_title=The man worth 2 million |work=Libération |location=France |language=French |date=11 May 2007 |url=http://www.liberation.fr/politiques/010119057-l-homme-qui-valait-2-millions  |accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the French President, one of his first actions was to give himself a pay rise: his yearly salary went from €101,000 to €240,000 (to match his European/French peers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jon Boyle |title=Jokes and anger in France over Sarkozy pay rise |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKL3132522020071031 |agency=Reuters   UK |date=31 October 2007 |accessdate=12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also entitled to a mayoral pension as a former mayor of [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]].

==Member of National Assembly==
Sarkozy is recognised by both the right and left's French parties as a skilled politician and striking [[orator]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;French Populism&quot;, by Ignacio Ramonet, [[Le Monde Diplomatique]], June 2007 Edition, [http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2007/06/RAMONET/14842 French version] {{Fr icon}}, [http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/053107G.shtml English translation] {{En icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His supporters within France emphasize his [[charisma]], political innovation and willingness to &quot;make a dramatic break&quot; amid mounting disaffection against &quot;politics as usual&quot;. Overall, he is considered more pro-United States and pro-Israeli than most French politicians.

Since November 2004, Sarkozy has been president of the [[Union for a Popular Movement|Union pour un Mouvement Populaire]] (UMP), France's major right-wing political party, and he was [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]] in the government of [[Dominique de Villepin]], with the honorific title of [[Minister of State]], making him effectively the number three official in the French State after President [[Jacques Chirac]] and the prime minister. His ministerial responsibilities included law enforcement and working to co-ordinate relationships between the national and local governments, as well as [[Minister of Worship (France)|Minister of Worship]] (in this role he created the [[French Council of the Muslim Faith|CFCM]], French Council of Muslim Faith). Previously, he was a deputy to the [[French National Assembly]]. He was forced to resign this position in order to accept his ministerial appointment. He previously also held several ministerial posts, including [[Finance Minister]].

===In government===
Sarkozy's political career began when he was 23, when he became a city councillor in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]]. A member of the [[Neo-Gaullist]] party RPR, he went on to be elected mayor of that town, after the death of the incumbent mayor [[Achille Peretti]]. Sarkozy had been close to Peretti, as his mother was Peretti's secretary. The senior RPR politician at the time, [[Charles Pasqua]], wanted to become mayor, and asked Sarkozy to organize his campaign. Instead Sarkozy profited from Pasqua's short illness to propel himself into the office of mayor.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Le Parisien]]'', 11 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He was the youngest mayor of any town in France with a population of over 50,000. He served from 1983 to 2002. In 1988, he became a deputy in the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]].

In 1993, Sarkozy was in the national news for personally negotiating with the &quot;Human Bomb&quot;, a man who had taken small children hostage in a [[kindergarten]] in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine|Neuilly]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesWin&quot;&gt;{{cite news

|date = 7 May 2007
|accessdate=8 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Human Bomb&quot; was killed after two days of talks by [[French National Police|policemen]] of the [[Recherche Assistance Intervention Dissuasion|RAID]], who entered the school stealthily while the attacker was resting.

At the same time, from 1993 to 1995, he was Minister for the Budget and spokesman for the executive in the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Édouard Balladur]]. Throughout most of his early career, Sarkozy had been seen as a protégé of [[Jacques Chirac]]. During his tenure, he increased France's public debt more than any other French Budget Minister, by the equivalent of €200&amp;nbsp;billion (USD260&amp;nbsp;billion) (FY 1994–1996). The first two budgets he submitted to the parliament (budgets for FY1994 and FY1995) assumed a yearly budget deficit equivalent to six percent of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Dette publique de la France|Dette publique de la France]] {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Maastricht Treaty]], the French yearly budget deficit may not exceed three percent of France's GDP.

In 1995, he spurned Chirac and backed [[Édouard Balladur]] for [[President of France]]. After Chirac won the election, Sarkozy lost his position as Minister for the Budget, and found himself outside the circles of power.

However, he returned after the right-wing defeat at the [[French legislative election, 1997|1997 parliamentary election]], as the number two candidate of the RPR. When the party leader [[Philippe Séguin]] resigned, in 1999, he took the leadership of the Neo-Gaullist party. But it obtained its worst result at the [[European Parliament election, 1999 (France)|1999 European Parliament election]], winning 12.7% of the votes, less than the dissident [[Rally for France]] of Charles Pasqua. Sarkozy lost the RPR leadership.
[[Image:Sarkozy-congres-ump.jpg|thumb|Nicolas Sarkozy speaking at the congress of his party, 28 November 2004]]
In 2002, however, after his re-election as President of the French Republic (see [[French presidential election, 2002]]), Chirac appointed Sarkozy as French Minister of the Interior in the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]], despite Sarkozy's support of Edouard Balladur for French President in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouthindependent.com/archives/2007/10/french-presiden.html Sauced Sarkozy] Felice E. Baker, The Dartmouth Independent, 31 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Following Chirac's 14 July keynote speech on road safety, Sarkozy as interior minister pushed through new legislation leading to the mass purchase of speed cameras and a campaign to increase the awareness of dangers on the roads.

In the cabinet reshuffle of 30 April 2004, Sarkozy became Finance Minister. Tensions continued to build between Sarkozy and Chirac and within the UMP party, as Sarkozy's intentions of becoming head of the party after the resignation of [[Alain Juppé]] became clear.

In party elections of 10 November 2004, Sarkozy became leader of the UMP with 85% of the vote. In accordance with an agreement with Chirac, he resigned as Finance Minister. Sarkozy's ascent was marked by the division of UMP between ''sarkozystes'', such as Sarkozy's &quot;first lieutenant&quot;, [[Brice Hortefeux]], and Chirac loyalists, such as [[Jean-Louis Debré]].

Sarkozy was made Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur (Knight of the [[Legion of Honour]]) by President Chirac in February 2005. He was re-elected on 13 March 2005 to the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]] (as required by the constitution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/english/8ab.asp#TITLE%20III |title=French Constitution, article 23 |publisher=Assemblee Nationale|accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; he had to resign as a deputy when he became minister in 2002).

On 31 May 2005 the main French news radio station ''[[France Info]]'' reported a rumour that Sarkozy was to be reappointed Minister of the Interior in the government of [[Dominique de Villepin]] without resigning from the UMP leadership. This was confirmed on 2 June 2005, when the members of the government were officially announced.

===First term as Minister of the Interior===

Towards the end of his first term as Minister of the Interior, in 2004, Sarkozy was the most divisive conservative politician in France, according to polls conducted at the beginning of 2004.

Sarkozy has sought to ease the sometimes tense relationships between the general French population and the [[Islam in France|Muslim community]]. Unlike the Catholic Church in France with their official leaders or Protestants with their umbrella organisations, the French Muslim community had a lack of structure with no group that could legitimately deal with the French government on their behalf. Sarkozy supported the foundation in May 2003 of the private non-profit [[French Council of the Muslim Faith|Conseil français du culte musulman]] (&quot;French Council of the Muslim Faith&quot;), an organisation meant to be representative of French Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Journal Officiel de la République Française|JO associations]]'', 28 May 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Sarkozy has suggested amending the [[1905 French law on the separation of Church and State|1905 law on the separation of Church and State]], mostly in order to be able to finance mosques and other Muslim institutions with public funds&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=19272&amp;sec=59&amp;con=2 WorldWide Religious News]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that they are less reliant on money from outside of France. It was not followed by any concrete measure.

===Minister of Finance===
During his short appointment as [[Minister of Finance (France)|Minister of Finance]], Sarkozy was responsible for introducing a number of policies. The degree to which this reflected ''libéralisme'' (a hands-off approach to running the economy) or more traditional French state ''dirigisme'' (intervention) is controversial. He resigned the day following his election as president of the [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]].

* In September 2004, Sarkozy oversaw the reduction of the government ownership stake in [[France Télécom]] from 50.4 percent to 41 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Thorel |first=Jerome |title=Le gouvernement finalise la privatisation de France Télécom |language=French |publisher=ZDNet France |date=1 September 2004 |url=http://www.zdnet.fr/actualites/business/0,39020715,39169571,00.htm |accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sarkozy backed a partial [[nationalisation]] of the large engineering company [[Alstom]] decided by his predecessor when the company was exposed to bankruptcy in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bruxelles valide le sauvetage d'Alstom |work=[[L'Expansion]] |publisher=[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]] |location=France |language=French |date=22 September 2003 |url=http://www.lexpansion.com/art/17.363.70036.0.html |accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In June 2004, Sarkozy reached an agreement with the major retail chains in France to concertedly lower prices on household goods by an average of two percent; the success of this measure is disputed, with studies suggesting that the decrease was close to one percent in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Grande distribution&amp;nbsp;: l'accord Sarkozy à moitié appliqué |work=L'Expansion |publisher=L'Express |location=France |language=French |date=30 September 2004 |url=http://www.lexpansion.com/art/2576.78716.0.html |accessdate=18 March 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Taxes: Sarkozy avoided taking a position on the ISF ([[solidarity tax on wealth]]). This is considered an ideological symbol by many on the [[political left|left]] and [[political right|right]]. Some in the business world and on the liberal right, such as [[Alain Madelin]], wanted it abolished. For Sarkozy, that would have risked being categorised by the left as a gift to the richest classes of society at a time of economic difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Martine |first=Gilson |title=ISF, la tentation des députés |trans_title=press review |work=Le Nouvel Observateur |location=France |language=French |date=20 May 2004 |url=http://www.nouvelobs.com/articles/p2063/a241461.html |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20050208204557/http://www.nouvelobs.com/articles/p2063/a241461.html |archivedate=8 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Villepin government===
===Second term as Minister of the Interior===
[[Image:2006 09 12 sarkozy 600.jpg|thumb|Sarkozy as Minister of the Interior with then U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]], after their bilateral meeting in Washington, D.C., 12 September 2006]]
During his second term at the Ministry of the Interior, Sarkozy was initially more discreet about his ministerial activities: instead of focusing on his own topic of law and order, many of his declarations addressed wider issues, since he was expressing his opinions as head of the UMP party.

{{Main|Response to the 2005 civil unrest in France}}
However, the [[2005 civil unrest in France|civil unrest in autumn 2005]] put law enforcement in the spotlight again. Sarkozy was accused of having provoked the unrest by calling young delinquents from [[housing project]]s &quot;rabble&quot; ''(&quot;[[racaille]]&quot;)'' in [[Argenteuil]] near Paris, and controversially suggested [[ethnic cleansing|cleansing]] the minority suburbs with a [[Kärcher]]. After the accidental death of two youths, which sparked the riots, Sarkozy first blamed it on &quot;hoodlums&quot; and gangsters. These remarks were sharply criticised by many on the left wing and by a member of his own government, Delegate Minister for Equal Opportunities [[Azouz Begag]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=921072 Azouz Begag, principal opposant à Nicolas Sarkozy], ''[[Le Monde]]'', 2 November 2005 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the rioting, he made a number of announcements on future policy: selection of immigrants, &lt;!--better/worse--&gt; greater tracking of immigrants, and a reform on the 1945 ordinance government justice measures for young delinquents.

===UMP leader===
Before he was elected President of France, Sarkozy was president of [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]], the French conservative party, elected with 85 percent of the vote. During his presidency, the number of members has significantly increased. In 2005, he supported a &quot;yes&quot; vote in the [[French referendum on the European Constitution]], but the &quot;No&quot; vote won.

Throughout 2005, Sarkozy called for radical changes in France's economic and social policies. These calls culminated in an interview with ''[[Le Monde]]'' on 8 September 2005, during which he claimed that the French had been misled for 30 years by false promises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sarkozyblog.free.fr/index.php?2005/09/07/170-le-meilleur-pour-la-france |title=Interview with ',Le Monde',, 8 September 2005 |publisher=Sarkozy Blog|date=19 September 2004 |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other issues:
* he called for a simplified and &quot;fairer&quot; [[tax code|taxation system]], with fewer loopholes and a maximum taxation rate (all ''direct'' taxes combined) at 50 percent of revenue;
* he approved measures reducing or denying social support to [[unemployment|unemployed]] workers who refuse work offered to them;
* he pressed for a reduction in the [[budget deficit]], claiming that the French state has been living off [[credit (finance)|credit]] for some time.

Such policies are what are called in France ''libéral'' (that is, in favour of [[laissez-faire]] economic policies) or, with a pejorative undertone, ''ultra-libéral''. Sarkozy rejects this label of ''libéral'' and prefers to call himself a pragmatist.

Sarkozy opened another avenue of controversy by declaring that he wanted a reform of the immigration system, with [[:wikt:quota|quota]]s designed to admit the skilled workers needed by the French economy. He also wants to reform the current French system for foreign students, saying that it enables foreign students to take open-ended curricula in order to obtain residency in France; instead, he wants to select the best students to the best curricula in France.

In early 2006, the [[French parliament]] adopted a controversial bill known as [[DADVSI]], which reforms [[French copyright law]]. Since his party was divided on the issue, Sarkozy stepped in and organised meetings between various parties involved. Later, groups such as the Odebi League and EUCD.info alleged that Sarkozy personally and unofficially supported certain amendments to the law, which enacted strong penalties against designers of [[peer-to-peer]] systems.

[[Image:Segolene Royal Arcueil 18 septembre 2010 6.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Ségolène Royal]] was Sarkozy's opponent during the presidential election.]]
Sarkozy was a likely candidate for the presidency in 2007; in an often-repeated comment made on television channel [[France 2]], when asked by a journalist whether he thought about the presidential election when he shaved in the morning, Sarkozy commented, &quot;not just when I shave&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtl.fr/rtlinfo/article.asp?dicid=159060 Broadcast of &quot;France 2&quot;], 19 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 January 2007, Sarkozy was chosen by the [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] to be its candidate in the 2007 presidential election. Sarkozy, who was running unopposed, won 98 percent of the votes. Of the 327,000 UMP members who could vote, 69 percent participated in the online ballot.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6260275.stm Sarkozy nod for presidential run]&quot;, ''BBC News'', 14 January 2007. Retrieved 14 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, Sarkozy appeared on a televised debate on [[TF1]] where he expressed his support for [[affirmative action]] and the freedom to work overtime. Despite his opposition to [[same-sex marriage]], he advocated [[civil unions]] and the possibility for same-sex partners to inherit under the same regime as married couples. The law was voted in July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;It was included in the ''paquet fiscal'' that has been one of the first laws passed in Parliament&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 February, Sarkozy decided in favour of a projected second, non-[[nuclear power|nuclear]], [[Future French aircraft carrier|aircraft carrier]] for the national Navy (adding to the nuclear [[Charles de Gaulle (R 91)|''Charles de Gaulle'']]), during an official visit in [[Toulon]] with Defence Minister [[Michèle Alliot-Marie]]. &quot;This would allow permanently having an operational ship, taking into account the constraints of maintenance&quot;, he explained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marianne2007.info/index.php?id_plugin=266&amp;path=newsAFP/page2News.php&amp;ftpUrl=070207164849.bmmbl7vt.txt&amp;pos=1&amp;action=plugin Sarkozy pour un deuxième porte-avions français] (AFP)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 March, President Jacques Chirac announced his support for Sarkozy. Chirac pointed out that Sarkozy had been chosen as presidential candidate for the ruling UMP party, and said: &quot;So it is totally natural that I give him my vote and my support.&quot; To focus on his campaign, Sarkozy stepped down as interior minister on 26 March.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/3/21/92845.shtml?s=os France's Jacques Chirac Backs Nicolas Sarkozy]. 21 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the campaign, rival candidates had accused Sarkozy of being a &quot;candidate for brutality&quot; and of presenting hard-line views about France's future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6566649.stm French confused over the real Sarkozy]. 18 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents also accused him of courting conservative voters in policy-making in a bid to capitalise on right-wing sentiments among some communities. However, his popularity was sufficient to see him polling as the frontrunner throughout the later campaign period, consistently ahead of rival Socialist candidate, Ségolène Royal.

The first round of the presidential election was held on 22 April 2007. Sarkozy came in first with 31.18 percent of the votes, ahead of [[Ségolène Royal]] of the Socialists with 25.87 percent. In the second round, Sarkozy came out on top to win the election with 53.06 percent of the votes ahead of [[Ségolène Royal]] with 46.94 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Élection présidentielle de 2007—[http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/PR2007/FE.html résultats définitifs] French Ministry of the Interior&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech immediately following the announcement of the election results, Sarkozy stressed the need for France's modernisation, but also called for national unity, mentioning that Royal was in his thoughts. In that speech, he claimed &quot;The French have chosen to break with the ideas, habits and behaviour of the past. I will restore the value of work, authority, merit and respect for the nation.&quot;

==Presidency==
{{Main|Presidency of Nicolas Sarkozy}}

On 6 May 2007, Nicolas Sarkozy became the sixth person to be elected President of the Fifth Republic (which was established in 1958), and the 23rd president in French history. He is the first French president to have been born after World War II.

The official transfer of power from Jacques Chirac took place on 16 May at 11:00&amp;nbsp;am (9:00 UTC) at the [[Élysée Palace]], where he was given the authorization codes of the [[Force de Frappe|French nuclear arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Samuel |first=Henry |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/05/17/wfra17.xml |title=Radiant Cécilia puts Sarkozy in the shade |work=Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=17 May 2007 |accessdate=9 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the afternoon, the new President flew to Berlin to meet with German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]].

Under Sarkozy's government, [[François Fillon]] replaced [[Dominique de Villepin]] as Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais_attente/salle_de_presse/communique_concernant_la_nommination_du_premier_ministre.76689.html Communiqué de la Présidence de la République concernant la nomination du Premier ministre.] ''[[Élysée Palace]]'', 17 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Sarkozy appointed [[Bernard Kouchner]], the left-wing founder of [[Médecins Sans Frontières]], as his foreign minister, leading to Kouchner's expulsion from the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]]. In addition to Kouchner, three more Sarkozy ministers are from the left, including [[Eric Besson]], who served as [[Ségolène Royal]]'s economic adviser at the beginning of her campaign. Sarkozy also appointed seven women to form a total cabinet of 15; one, Justice Minister [[Rachida Dati]], is the first woman of Northern African origin to serve in a French cabinet. Of the 15, two attended the elite [[École nationale d'administration]] (ENA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9226982 France's New Government – A study in perpetual motion], ''[[The Economist]]'', 23 June 2007 {{En icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ministers were reorganised, with the controversial creation of a 'Ministry of Immigration, Integration, National Identity and Co-Development'—given to his right-hand man [[Brice Hortefeux]]—and of a 'Ministry of Budget, Public Accounts and Civil Administration'—handed out to [[Éric Wœrth]], supposed to prepare the replacement of only a third of all civil servants who retire. However, after the 17 June parliamentary elections, the Cabinet has been adjusted to 15 ministers and 16 deputy ministers, totalling 31 officials.

Shortly after taking office, Sarkozy began negotiations with Colombian president [[Álvaro Uribe]] and the left-wing [[guerrilla]] [[FARC]], regarding the release of hostages held by the rebel group, especially Franco-Colombian politician [[Ingrid Betancourt]]. According to some sources, Sarkozy himself asked for Uribe to release FARC's &quot;chancellor&quot; [[Rodrigo Granda]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacronica.com/EdicionEnLinea/Notas/Internacional/08062007/244942.aspx Llama G8 a FARC contribuir a liberación de rehenes], ''La Cronica'', 8 June 2007 {{Es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he announced on 24 July 2007, that French and European representatives had obtained the extradition of the [[HIV trial in Libya|Bulgarian nurses detained in Libya]] to their country. In exchange, he signed with [[Muammar Gaddafi]] security, health care and immigration pacts—and a $230&amp;nbsp;million (168&amp;nbsp;million euros) [[MILAN]] antitank missile sale.&lt;ref name=&quot;WP Moore&quot;&gt;Molly Moore, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/03/AR2007080301950.html France's Sarkozy Off to a Running Start], ''[[Washington Post]]'', 4 August 2007 {{En icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contract was the first made by Libya since 2004, and was negotiated with [[MBDA]], a subsidiary of [[EADS]].

On 8 June 2007, during the [[33rd G8 summit]] in [[Heiligendamm]], Sarkozy set a goal of reducing French [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] emissions by 50 percent by 2050 in order to prevent [[global warming]]. He then pushed forward Socialist [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]] as European nominee to the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/economie/20070710.WWW000000271_fmi_strauss_kahn_candidat_officiel_de_lunion_europeenne.html FMI: Strauss-Kahn candidat officiel de l'Union européenne], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 10 July 2007 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics alleged that Sarkozy proposed to nominate Strauss-Kahn as managing director of the IMF to deprive the Socialist Party of one of its more popular figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSPAB00331220070707 France's Sarkozy wants Strauss-Kahn as IMF head] [[Reuters]], 7 July 2007 {{En icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP), Sarkozy's party, won a majority at the [[French legislative election, 2007|June 2007 legislative election]], although by less than expected. In July, the UMP majority, seconded by the ''[[Nouveau Centre]]'', ratified one of Sarkozy's electoral promises, which was to partially revoke the [[inheritance tax]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/pratique-patrimoine/20070713.FIG000000211_les_deputes_votent_la_quasi_suppression_des_droits_de_succession.html Les députés votent la quasi-suppression des droits de succession], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 13 July 2007 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/actualite/politiques/266891.FR.php Les droits de succession (presque) supprimés], ''[[Libération]]'', 13 July 2007 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inheritance tax formerly brought eight billion euros into state coffers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanite.fr/2007-06-07_Politique_Droits-de-succession-pour-une-minorite-de-menages-aises Droits de succession: pour une minorité de ménages aisés], ''[[L'Humanité]]'', 7 June 2007 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:G8 summit in L'Aquila, family photo.jpg|thumb|Sarkozy (at left) attending the [[35th G8 summit|G-8 Summit]] in 2009]]
Sarkozy's UMP majority prepared a budget that reduced taxes, in particular for [[upper middle-class]] people, allegedly in an effort to [[Supply-side economics|boost GDP growth]], but did not reduce state expenditures.&lt;!-- The vote of the budget hasn't taken place yet !! --&gt; He was criticised by the European Commission for doing so.

Sarkozy broke with the custom of [[amnesty]]ing traffic tickets and of releasing thousands of prisoners from overcrowded jails on [[Bastille Day]], a tradition that [[Napoleon]] had started in 1802 to commemorate the [[storming of the Bastille]] during the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WP Moore&quot; /&gt;

Sarkozy's government issued a [[decree]] on 7 August 2007 to generalise a voluntary [[biometric]] profiling program of travellers in airports. The program, called 'Parafes', was to use fingerprints. The [[governmental databases|new database]] would be interconnected with the [[Schengen Information System]] (SIS) as well as with a national database of wanted persons ([[FPR]]). The Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés ([[CNIL]]) protested against this new decree, opposing itself to the recording of fingerprints and to the interconnection between the SIS and the FPR.&lt;ref name=Parafes&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-942808@51-931629,0.html Généralisation du fichage biométrique volontaire des voyageurs dans les aéroports français], ''[[Le Monde]]'', 8 August 2007 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 July 2008, the French parliament passed constitutional reforms which Sarkozy had made one of the key pledges of his presidential campaign. The vote was 539 to 357, one vote over the three-fifths majority required; the changes are not yet finalized. They would introduce a two-term limit for the presidency, and end the president's right of collective pardon. They would allow the president to address parliament in-session, and parliament, to set its own agenda. They would give parliament a veto over some presidential appointments, while ending government control over parliament's committee system. He has claimed that these reforms strengthen parliament, while some opposition socialist lawmakers have described it as a &quot;consolidation of a monocracy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;France backs constitution reform; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7517505.stm France backs constitution reform] BBC News, 21 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 July 2008, parliament voted the &quot;loi de modernisation de l'économie&quot; (Modernization of the Economy Law) which loosened restrictions on retail prices and reduced limitations on the creation of businesses. The Government has also made changes to long-standing French work-hour regulations, allowing employers to negotiate overtime with employees and making all hours worked past the traditional French 35-hour week tax-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displayStory.cfm?source=hptextfeature&amp;story_id=11792306|title=France—The reformist president|date=24 July 2008|accessdate=27 July 2008|work=The Economist }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as a result of the [[global financial crisis of 2008|global financial crisis]] that came to a head in September 2008, Sarkozy has returned to the [[state interventionism]] of his predecessors, declaring that &quot;laissez-faire capitalism is over&quot; and denouncing the &quot;[[dictatorship]] of the market&quot;.

France wielded special international power when Sarkozy held the rotating EU Presidency from July 2008 through December 2008. Sarkozy has publicly stated his intention to attain EU approval of a [[progressivism|progressive]] energy package before the end of his EU Presidency. This energy package would clearly define climate change objectives for the EU and hold members to specific reductions in emissions. In further support of his collaborative outlook on climate change, Sarkozy has led the EU into a partnership with China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eubusiness.com/China/climate-change.23 New chapter opens in EU-China Climate Change Partnership] EUbusiness.com, 29 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 December 2008, Nicolas Sarkozy, current Chairman of the European Union, met the [[Tenzin Gyatso|Dalai Lama]] in Poland and outraged China, which has announced that it would postpone the China-EU summit indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hm4uz6lCdhPdwJhNTl63SxPrkKhA |title=France's Sarkozy meets Dalai Lama as China fumes |publisher=Google |date=6 December 2008 |accessdate=9 March 2010|agency=AFP}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 April 2009, at the [[NATO]] Summit in [[Strasbourg]], Sarkozy announced that France would offer [[Right of asylum|asylum]] to a former [[Guantanamo captive]].&lt;ref name=HoustonChronicle2009-04-02&gt;

===Involvement in Libya===
[[File:Nicolas Sarkozy addresses the E-G8 Forum.jpg|thumb|Nicolas Sarkozy address the E-G8 Forum in Paris in 2011]]
In March 2011, after having been criticized for his unwillingness to support the Egyptian and Tunisian revolutions, and persuaded by the philosopher [[Bernard-Henri Levy]] to have France actively engage against the forces of the Libyan leader, [[Muammar Gaddafi]], Nicolas Sarkozy was amongst the first Heads of State to demand the resignation of Gaddafi and his government, which was then fighting a civil war in [[Libya]]. On 10 March 2011, Nicolas Sarkozy welcomed to the Elysee Palace, three emissaries from the Libyan Transitory Rebel Council (CNTT), brought to him by Bernard-Henri Levy who mediated at the meeting. Nicolas Sarkozy promised them a no-fly zone would be imposed on Gaddafi's aeroplanes. He also promised them France's military assistance. On 17 March 2011, at the behest of France, resolution 1973 was adopted by the Security Council of the United Nations, permitting the creation of a &quot;no fly&quot; zone over Libya, and for the undertaking of &quot;necessary measures&quot; for the protection of the country's civilian population. On 19 March 2011, Nicolas Sarkozy officially announced the beginning of a military intervention in Libya, with France's participation. These actions of Nicolas Sarkozy were favorably received by the majority of the French political class and public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lejdd.fr/International/Actualite/La-Libye-un-veritable-succes-diplomatique-pour-Sarkozy-285403/ |title=La Libye, un véritable succès diplomatique pour Sarkozy? |publisher=leJDD.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=2011-12-12#folio=CV1] &quot;No Exit&quot; by Philip Gourevitch, 12 December 2011, New Yorker&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/02/world/africa/02levy.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Steven | last=Erlanger | title=In His Telling, One Man Made Libya a French Cause | date=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' journalist Colin Randall has highlighted Sarkozy's tighter control of his image and frequent interventions in the media: &quot;he censors a book, or fires the chief editor of a weekly.&quot;&lt;ref name=Leprince/&gt; Sarkozy is reported by Reuters to be sensitive about his height (believed to be {{convert|165|cm|ftin|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Socialists say Sarkozy has &quot;small man syndrome&quot; | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL2186523220070921 |agency=Reuters   | date=21 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The French media have pointed out that [[Sarkosy#Carla Bruni|Carla Bruni]] frequently wears flats when in public with him. In 2009, this was the subject of a political row, when a worker at a factory where Sarkozy gave a speech said she was asked to stand next to him because she was of a similar height (this story was corroborated by some trade union officials). The president's office called the accusation &quot;completely absurd and grotesque&quot;, while the Socialist Party mocked his fastidious preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8243486.stm#graphic|title=Sarkozy height row grips France |publisher=BBC News |date=8 August 2009|accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarkozy lost a suit against a manufacturer of Sarkozy [[voodoo doll]]s, in which he claimed that he had a right to his own image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/10/30/europe/france.php &quot;France enjoys Sarkozy's voodoo doll setback&quot;] by Katrin Bennhold, [[International Herald Tribune]], 30 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
{{Criticism section|date=May 2011}}
Generally, Sarkozy is strongly disliked by the Left, and is also criticised by some on the Right, most vocally by supporters of [[Jacques Chirac]] and [[Dominique de Villepin]], such as [[Jean-Louis Debré]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marianne2007.info/Cette-droite-qui-dit-non-a-Sarkozy_a313.html|title=Cette droite qui dit &quot;non&quot; à Sarkozy|publisher=Marianne2007.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la-croix.com/article/index.jsp?docId=2288253&amp;rubId=4076|title=Boutin renonce à se présenter et soutient Sarkozy|work=La Croix |location=France}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine ''[[Marianne (magazine)|Marianne]]'' accused Sarkozy of changing opinion in an [[Airbus]] affair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:kUwVpYZ23QMJ:www.marianne2.fr/Le-retournement-de-Sarkozy-sur-Airbus_a884.html Marianne – Le retournement de Sarkozy sur la recapitulisation de la société Airbus], 5 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[French Communist Party|communist]]-leaning magazine ''[[L'Humanité]]'' accused Sarkozy of being a [[populism|populist]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[L'Humanité]]'', [http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/2005-06-11/2005-06-11-808328 Humanite.presse.fr], 11 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Anti Sarko 480342767 8b13c8532f o d.jpg|thumb|Many on the Left have a particular distrust for Nicolas Sarkozy; specific &quot;anti-Sarko&quot; movements have been started]]

In 2004 Sarkozy co-authored a book, ''La République, les religions, l'espérance'' (''The Republic, Religions, and Hope''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|coauthors=Thibaud Collin, Philippe Verdin|last=Sarkozy|first=Nicolas|title=La République, les religions, l'espérance|publisher=[[Les éditions du Cerf]]|year=2004|isbn=2204072834}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he argued that the young should not be brought up solely on secular or [[republicanism|republican]] values. He advocated reducing the [[separation of church and state]], arguing for the government [[subsidy]] of mosques in order to encourage Islamic integration into French society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=L'Etat Doit-Il Financer La Construction de Mosquées&amp;nbsp;?|publisher=Libres.org|language=French|date=2 July 2007|url=http://www.libres.org/francais/actualite/archives/actualit%E9_1004/mosquees_a5_4504.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opposes financing of religious institutions with funds from outside France. After meeting with [[Tom Cruise]], Sarkozy was criticised by some for meeting with a member of the [[Church of Scientology]], which is seen as a cult in France (see [[Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Worldwide Religious News'', 2 September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Sarkozy stated that &quot;the roots of France are essentially Christian&quot; at December 2007 speech in Rome. He called [[Islam]] &quot;one of the greatest and most beautiful civilizations the world has known&quot; at a speech in [[Riyadh]] in January 2008. Both comments drew criticism from Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=French President's religious mixing riles critics|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/french.presidents.religious.mixing.riles.critics/16423.htm|date=23 January 2008|work=Christianity Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the midst of a tense period and following the accidental death of an 11-year-old boy in the Paris suburb of [[La Courneuve]] in June 2005, Sarkozy quoted a local resident and vowed to clean the area out &quot;with a [[Kärcher]]&quot; (''nettoyer la cité au Kärcher'', referring to a well-known German brand of pressure-cleaning equipment), and two days before the [[2005 civil unrest in France|2005 Paris riots]] he referred to the criminal youth of the housing projects as ''voyous'' (thugs) and ''racaille'', a slang term which can be translated into English as ''rabble'', ''scum'' or ''riff-raff'';&lt;ref&gt;answering to a resident who addressed Sarkozy with &quot;''Quand nous débarrassez-vous de cette racaille ?''&quot; (When will you rid us of these dregs?) – {{cite news|title=Banlieues&amp;nbsp;: filmer et raconter avec Françoise Laborde, Claude Dilain, Nicolas Comte, Guillaume Biet (Les videos)|work=Arrêt sur images|language=French|publisher=[[France 5]]|date=6 November 2005|url=http://www.france5.fr/asi/007548/10/129836.cfm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070703031423/http://www.france5.fr/asi/007548/10/129836.cfm|archivedate=3 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[French Communist Party]]'s publication ''L'Humanité'' branded this language as inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nicolas Sarkozy pompier pyromane|work=L'Humanité |location=France|date=2 November 2005|url=http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/2005-11-02/2005-11-02-817109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005 Sarkozy was accused of pushing for a hasty inquiry into an arson attack on a police station in [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]], of which the alleged perpetrators were [[acquittal|acquitted]] for lack of proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Incendie de Pau&amp;nbsp;: les 8 accusés acquittés|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=Le Nouvel Observateur |location=France|language=French|date=1 October 2005|url=http://permanent.nouvelobs.com/societe/20051001.OBS0822.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080529212216rn_1/archquo.nouvelobs.com/cgi/articles?ad=societe/20051001.OBS0822.html&amp;host=http://permanent.nouvelobs.com/|archivedate=29 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 June 2005 Sarkozy told law enforcement officials that he had questioned the Minister of Justice about the future of &quot;the judge&quot; who had freed a man on [[parole]] who had later committed a murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicolas Sarkozy veut faire &quot;&amp;nbsp;payer&amp;nbsp;&quot; un juge pour &quot;&amp;nbsp;sa faute&amp;nbsp;&quot;|work=Le Monde|language=French|format=Fee required for full article|date=23 June 2005|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-665357@51-660372,0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarkozy opposed the U.S.-led [[Iraq War|invasion of Iraq]]. However, he was critical of the way Jacques Chirac and his foreign minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] expressed France's opposition to the war. Talking at the French-American Foundation in Washington, D.C. on 12 September 2006, he denounced what he called the &quot;French arrogance&quot; and said: &quot;It is bad manners to embarrass one's allies or sound like one is taking delight in their troubles.&quot;&lt;ref name=Iraq_speech&gt;{{Fr icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/actualite/politiques/205032.FR.php|title=Chirac juge &quot;lamentable&quot; l'atlantisme de Sarkozy|author=[[Libération]]|date=18 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added: &quot;We must never again turn our disagreements into a crisis.&quot; Jacques Chirac reportedly said in private that Sarkozy's speech was &quot;appalling&quot; and &quot;a shameful act&quot;.&lt;ref name=Iraq_speech/&gt;

Even though his former foreign minister [[Bernard Kouchner]] (excluded from the Socialist party after his inclusion in [[François Fillon]]'s government) had been one of the few supporters in France of removal of [[Saddam Hussein]] from power, Sarkozy's stance on the war has not changed.

A few weeks before the first round of the 2007 presidential elections, Sarkozy said during an interview with philosopher [[Michel Onfray]]&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophie Magazine'', nr 8, April 2007; [http://philomag.com/article,dialogue,nicolas-sarkozy-et-michel-onfray-confidences-entre-ennemis,288.php online extracts]&lt;/ref&gt; that he thinks disorders such as [[paedophilia]] and depression have a [[gene]]tic as well as social basis, saying &quot;I don't agree with you, I'd be inclined to think that one is born a paedophile, and it is actually a problem that we do not know how to cure this disease&quot;; he also claimed that suicides among youth were linked to genetic predispositions by stating, &quot;I don't want to give parents a complex. It's not exclusively the parents' fault every time a youngster commits suicide.&quot; These statements were criticised by some scientists, including controversial geneticist [[Axel Kahn]].&lt;ref&gt;[[L'Humanité]], 4 April 2007, ''[http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/2007-04-04/2007-04-04-848961 « Un gène ne commande jamais un destin humain »]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Le Monde]], 11 April 2007, ''[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-823448,36-894367@51-893376,0.html Tollé dans la communauté scientifique après les propos de Nicolas Sarkozy sur la génétique]''&lt;/ref&gt; Sarkozy later said, &quot;What part is innate and what part is acquired? At least let's debate it, let's not close the door to all debate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'', 10 April 2007, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/france/story/0,,2053956,00.html &quot;Row over Sarkozy's paedophilia comment refuses to go away&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 July 2007, Sarkozy delivered a speech in Senegal, written by Henri Guaino, in which he made reference to &quot;African [[peasant]]s&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;news24Africa&quot;&gt;''News24.com''; 28 July 2007; [http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_2154961,00.html Sarkozy's Africa vision under fire]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardianAfrica&quot;&gt;Chris McGreal;''The Guardian'' (UK) 27 August 2007 [http://www.guardian.co.uk/france/story/0,,2156809,00.html Mbeki criticised for praising 'racist' Sarkozy]&lt;/ref&gt;  The controversial remarks were widely condemned by Africans, who viewed them as racist.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardianAfrica&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Agier, [http://www.vacarme.eu.org/article1493.html l'Afrique en France après le discours de Dakar], ''Vacarme'' n°42 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mgAfrica&quot;&gt;[[Achille Mbembe]]; ''Mail and Guardian (South Africa)''; 27 August 2007; [http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=317571&amp;area=/insight/insight__comment_and_analysis/ Sacré bleu! Mbeki and Sarkozy?]&lt;/ref&gt; South African president [[Thabo Mbeki]] praised Sarkozy's speech, which raised criticism by some in the South African media.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardianAfrica&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mgAfrica&quot;/&gt;

On 23 February 2008, Sarkozy was filmed by a reporter for French newspaper ''[[Le Parisien]]'' having the following exchange while visiting the [[Paris International Agricultural Show]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Premiers pas mouvementés de Sarkozy au salon de l'agriculture|work=vidéos|work=Le Parisien |location=France|language=French|format=[[SWF]]|date=23 February 2008|url=http://videos.leparisien.fr/video/iLyROoaftL1D.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
While quickly crossing the hall Saturday morning, in the middle of the crowd, Sarkozy encounters a recalcitrant visitor who refuses to shake his hand. &quot;Ah no, don't touch me!&quot;, said the man. The president retorted immediately: &quot;Get lost, then.&quot; &quot;You're making me dirty&quot;, yelled the man. With a frozen smile, Sarkozy says, his teeth glistening, a refined &quot;Get lost, then, poor dumb-ass, go.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;In French: ''Lors de sa traversée éclair du salon samedi matin, en plein bain de foule, Sarkozy croise un visiteur récalcitrant qui refuse sa poignée de main. «Ah non, touche-moi pas», prévient-il. Le chef de l'État rétorque sans détour : «Casse-toi, alors.» «Tu me salis», embraye l'homme. Le sourire se crispe. Sarkozy lâche, desserrant à peine les dents, un raffiné «Casse-toi alors, pauv'con, va».''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This exchange has been cause for much humour and debate regarding its propriety in the French press. It should also be noted that a precise translation into English has many possible variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldhammer|first=Arthur|url=http://artgoldhammer.blogspot.com/2008/02/found-on-web.html|title=Found on the web|work=French Politics|publisher=An American observer comments on French politics|date=25 February 2008|accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=713778 &quot;French supporters defend Sarkozy&quot;] [[Agence France-Presse]], 25 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=334307|title=Sarkozy runs afoul of critics with rank reply|author=Crispian Balmer|agency=[[Reuters]]|location=[[Toronto]]|work=National Post |location=Canada |page=A2|date=26 February 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;br&gt;&amp;bull; Article noted at [http://www.fpinfomart.ca/news/ar_results.php?q=1136115&amp;sort=pubd&amp;page=1&amp;n%5Bdb%5D%5B%5D=ntnp&amp;n%5Bby%5D%5B%5D=Crispian+Balmer fpinfomart.ca], but is not available.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 August 2008, Hervé Eon, from [[Laval, Mayenne|Laval]] came to an anti-Sarkozy demonstration with a sign bearing the words ''Casse-toi pov' con'', the exact words Sarkozy had uttered. Eon was arrested for causing offence to the presidential function and the prosecutor, who in France indirectly reports to the president, requested a fine of 1000€.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Poignard |first=Anne-Claire|title=&quot;&amp;nbsp;Casse-toi, pauvre con&amp;nbsp;!&amp;nbsp;&quot;&amp;nbsp;: quatre mots à 1&amp;nbsp;000 euros|work=Le Monde|language=French|format=Fee required for full article|date=24 October 2008|url= http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2008/10/24/casse-toi-pauvre-con-quatre-mots-a-1-000-euros_1110685_823448.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Eon|title=&quot;&amp;nbsp;Casse-toi pov'con&amp;nbsp;&quot;&amp;nbsp;: au tribunal pour outrage au Président|language=French|publisher=[[Rue 89]]|date=4 September 2008|url=http://www.rue89.com/2008/09/04/casse-toi-povcon-au-tribunal-pour-outrage-au-president}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The court eventually imposed a symbolic 30€ suspended fine, which has generally been interpreted as a defeat for the prosecution side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rue89.com/2008/11/06/casse-toi-povcon-30-euros-avec-sursis-pour-herve-eon |title=&quot; Casse-toi pov'con &quot; : 30 euros avec sursis pour Hervé Eon |publisher=Rue89 |date=2008-11-14 |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident was widely reported on, in particular as Sarkozy, as president of the Republic, is [[Sovereign immunity|immune from prosecution]], notably restricting Eon's rights to sue Sarkozy for defamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Raphaëlle Besse Desmoulières|title=Le délit d'outrage est une infraction obsolète|work=Le Monde|language=French|date=23 October 2008|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2008/10/23/le-delit-d-outrage-est-une-infraction-obsolete_1110460_3224.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 November 2009, Sarkozy posted on his Facebook page a picture supposedly showing him chipping away at the [[Berlin Wall]] during its fall. However, the dates were inconsistent and the picture was proven to be fake – and later archived footage confirmed this. This news of forgery spread in France, and later evolved into a meme, &quot;Sarkozy Was There&quot;, where Sarkozy is photoshopped into historical events.

On 5 July 2010, following its investigations on the [[Bettencourt affair]], online newspaper [[Mediapart]] ran an article in which Claire Thibout, an ex-accountant working for [[Liliane Bettencourt]], accused Nicolas Sarkozy and [[Eric Woerth]] of receiving illegal campaign donations in 2007, in cash.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediapart.fr/ ''L'ex-comptable des Bettencourt accuse: des enveloppes d'argent à Woerth et à Sarkozy''], original report, in French&lt;!-- right now on the main page, no other URL --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e72598de-88d5-11df-8925-00144feab49a.html?ftcamp=rss|title=Financial Times article|work=Financial Times |date=6 July 2010|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 July 2010, Sarkozy suggested a new policy of security, and he proposed &quot;stripping foreign-born French citizens who opted to acquire their nationality at their majority of their citizenship if they are convicted of threatening the life of a police officer or other serious crimes&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Casting Out the Un-French&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/06/opinion/06fri2.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nicolas_sarkozy|work=The New York Times|title=Casting Out the Un-French|date=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy has been criticized for example by the US newspaper ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Casting Out the Un-French&quot;/&gt; by Sarkozy's political opponents, including the leader of the [[Socialist Party (France)|PS]], [[Martine Aubry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/politique/securite-aubry-denonce-la-derive-antirepublicaine-de-sarkozy-et-de-sa-majorite-01-08-2010-1221034_20.php |title=Réaction : SÉCURITÉ – Aubry dénonce la &quot;dérive antirépublicaine&quot; de Sarkozy et de sa majorité, actualité Politique : Le Point|work=Le Point |location=France|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by experts of French law, including the ex-member of the [[Constitutional Council of France]], [[Robert Badinter]], who said that such action would be unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2010/08/02/badinter-rappelle-a-sarkozy-l-egalite-de-tous-les-francais-devant-la-loi_1394701_823448.html|title=Badinter rappelle à Sarkozy l'égalité de tous les Français devant la loi|work=Le Monde |location=France|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paris West University Nanterre La Défense''' (''Université Paris Ouest Nanterre La Défense'') formerly called '''Paris X Nanterre''' is a French university in the [[List of public universities in France by academy#Academy of Versailles|Academy of Versailles]]. It is one of the 13 successor universities of the [[University of Paris]]. It is located in the western suburb of [[Nanterre]], near [[La Défense]], the business district of [[Paris]]. It is commonly referred to as '''Nanterre'''.

== History ==
[[File:Nanterre-250x188.jpg|left|thumb|Ths Social Sciences buildings]]
Nanterre was built in the 1960s on the outskirts of [[Paris]] as an extension of the Sorbonne. Based on the [[Anglosphere|American]] model, it was created as a [[campus]] (as opposed to the old French universities which were smaller and integrated to the city they were in). 

Nanterre became famous shortly after its opening by being at the center of the [[French May|May 68 student rebellion]]. The campus was nicknamed &quot;Nanterre, la folle&quot; (Mad Nanterre) or &quot;Nanterre la rouge&quot; (Red Nanterre, in reference to communism). To this day, the university remains traditionally a center of the left wing, as opposed to universities such as [[University of Paris II: Panthéon-Assas|Paris II-Assas]], traditionally inclined to the right.

== Size and scope ==
Nanterre is the second largest campus in France after [[Nantes]], with its own Olympic-sized swimming pool and a stadium. It welcomes 35 to 40,000 students every year in all fields of studies: [[Social Sciences]], [[Philosophy]], [[Literature]], [[History]], Languages and [[Linguistics]], [[Economics]], [[Law]] and [[Political Sciences]], as well as Teacher Training, [[Acting]], [[Film|Cinema]], [[Physiology]] and [[Sports]].

The university is renowned in the fields of Law and Economics. Even though French universities are required by law to admit anyone with a [[Baccalauréat]], strain is put on the students from the start and the first year drop-out rate consistently hovers in the 60% region. At postgraduate level, the university offers very competitive programs (highly selective Masters in Law and Business) and partnerships with some [[grandes écoles]] such as the [[Ecole Polytechnique]], [[ESSEC]], [[Ecole des Mines]] de Paris, [[ESCP Europe]] ...

The Rene Ginouves Institute for Archaeology and Anthropology (Maison de l'archeologie et de l'ethnologie Rene Ginouves) is another important institution on campus, merging the departments of the [[CNRS]], [[University of Paris I: Panthéon-Sorbonne|Paris I-Panthéon Sorbonne]] and  Paris X-Nanterre.

As in most Parisian universities, there is a large minority of foreign exchange students.
[[Image:Lavie.gif|right|thumb|Paris X-Nanterre in May 68]]

== Innovative programs ==
Over the years, Nanterre has developed innovative programs such as the double bilingual courses in French Law and Anglo-American, Spanish, Russian, German or Italian law, in Economics &amp; Management (with half of the courses in French and half of the courses in another foreign language), in History (with half of the courses in French and half of the courses in another foreign language). These programs have inspired many universities and grandes écoles throughout the country and are now renowned on the national level.

{{Politics of France}}

The '''President of the French Republic''' ({{lang-fr|Président de la République française}}) colloquially referred to in English as the '''President of France''', is France's elected [[Head of State]].

Four of France's five republics have had presidents as their [[heads of state]], making the French presidency the oldest presidency in Europe still to exist in some form.
In each of the republics' constitutions, the president's powers, functions and duties, and their relation with French governments differed.

For details about the French system of government see [[Government of France]].

The president of France is also the [[ex officio]] [[List of Co-Princes of Andorra|Co-Prince]] of [[Andorra]], Grand Master of the [[Légion d'honneur]] and the [[Ordre national du Mérite]] and honorary proto-canon of the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]] in Rome.

The current President of the Republic is [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], since 6 May 2007.

==Current presidential powers==
The [[French Fifth Republic]] is a [[semi-presidential system]]. Unlike many other European presidents, the office of the French President is quite powerful. Although it is the [[Prime Minister of France]] and parliament that oversee much of the nation's actual lawmaking, the French President wields significant influence. The president holds the nation's most senior office, and outranks all other politicians.

===Summary===
The president's greatest power is their ability to choose the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]]. However, since only the [[French National Assembly]] has the power to dismiss the Prime Minister's government, the president is forced to name a prime minister who can command the support of a majority in the assembly.
*When the majority of the Assembly has opposite political views to that of the president, this leads to political ''[[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]]''. In that case, the president's power is diminished, since much of the de facto power relies on a supportive prime minister and National Assembly, and is not directly attributed to the post of president.
*When the majority of the Assembly sides with him, the President can take a more active role and may, in effect, direct government policy. The prime minister is then the personal choice of the President, and can be easily replaced if the administration becomes unpopular. This device has been used in recent years by both [[François Mitterrand]] and [[Jacques Chirac]].
Since 2002, the mandate of the president and the Assembly are both 5 years and the two elections are close to each other. Therefore, the likelihood of a &quot;cohabitation&quot; is lower. 
Among the powers of the government:
*The president [[promulgation|promulgate]]s laws.
**The president has a very limited form of suspensive [[veto]]: when presented with a law, he or she can request another reading of it by Parliament, but only once per law.
**The president may also refer the law for review to the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] prior to promulgation.
*The president may dissolve the [[French National Assembly]]
*The president may refer treaties or certain types of laws to popular [[referendum]], within certain conditions, among them the agreement of the Prime minister or the parliament.
*The president is the [[Commander-in-Chief]] (CINC) of the armies.
*The president may order the use of nuclear weapons.
*The president names the Prime minister but he cannot dismiss him. He names and dismisses the other ministers, with the agreement of the Prime minister.
*The president names most officials (with the assent of the cabinet).
*The president names certain members of the Constitutional Council.
*The president receives foreign ambassadors.
*The president may grant a [[pardon]] (but not an [[amnesty]]) to convicted criminals; the president can also lessen or suppress criminal sentences. This was of crucial importance when France still operated the death penalty: criminals sentenced to death would generally request that the president commute their sentence to [[life imprisonment]].

All decisions of the president must be countersigned by the Prime minister, except dissolving the [[French National Assembly]].

===Detailed constitutional powers===
The [[constitutional]] attributions of the president are defined in Title II of the [[Constitution of France]].

'''Article 5'''
The President of the Republic shall see that the Constitution is observed. He shall ensure, by his arbitration, the proper functioning of the public authorities and the continuity of the State.
He shall be the guarantor of national independence, territorial integrity and observance of treaties.

'''Article 8'''
The President of the Republic shall appoint the Prime Minister. He shall terminate the appointment of the Prime Minister when the latter tenders the resignation of the Government.
On the proposal of the Prime Minister, he shall appoint the other members of the Government and terminate their appointments.

'''Article 9'''
The President of the Republic shall preside over the Council of Ministers.

'''Article 10'''
The President of the Republic shall promulgate Acts of Parliament within fifteen days following the final adoption of an Act and its transmission to the Government.
He may, before the expiry of this time limit, ask Parliament to reconsider the Act or sections of the Act. Reconsideration shall not be refused.

''While the president has to sign all acts adopted by parliament into law, he cannot refuse to do so and exercise a kind of right of [[veto]]; his only power in that matter is to ask for a single reconsideration of the law by parliament and this power is subject to countersigning by the Prime minister.''

'''Article 11''' The president may submit laws to the citizens in a referendum with advice and consent of the cabinet.

'''Article 12'''
The President of the Republic may, after consulting the Prime Minister and the Presidents of the assemblies, declare the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] dissolved.
A general election shall take place not less than twenty days and not more than forty days after the dissolution.
The National Assembly shall convene as of right on the second Thursday following its election. Should it so convene outside the period prescribed for the ordinary session, a session shall be called by right for a fifteen-day period.
No further dissolution shall take place within a year following this election.

'''Article 13'''
The President of the Republic shall sign the [[ordonnance (French constitutional law)|ordinance]]s and [[decree#France|decree]]s deliberated upon in the Council of Ministers.
He shall make appointments to the civil and military posts of the State. [...]

'''Article 14'''
The President of the Republic shall accredit [[Ambassador (diplomacy)|ambassador]]s and envoys extraordinary to foreign powers ; foreign ambassadors and envoys extraordinary shall be accredited to him.

'''Article 15'''
The President of the Republic shall be commander-in-chief of the [[Military of France|armed forces]]. He shall preside over the higher national defence councils and committees.

'''Article 16'''
Where the institutions of the Republic, the independence of the Nation, the integrity of its territory or the fulfilment of its international commitments are under serious and immediate threat, and where the proper functioning of the constitutional public authorities is interrupted, the President of the Republic shall take the measures required by these circumstances, after formally consulting the Prime Minister, the Presidents of the assemblies and the Constitutional Council.
He shall inform the Nation of these measures in a message.
The measures must stem from the desire to provide the constitutional public authorities, in the shortest possible time, with the means to carry out their duties. The [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] shall be consulted with regard to such measures. Parliament shall convene as of right.
The [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]] shall not be dissolved during the exercise of the emergency powers.

''Article 16, allowing the president a limited form of [[rule by decree]] for a limited period of time in exceptional circumstance, has been used only once, by [[Charles de Gaulle]] during the [[Algerian War]], from 23 April to 29 September 1961.''

'''Article 17'''
The President of the Republic has the right to grant [[pardon]].

'''Article 18'''
The President of the Republic shall communicate with the two assemblies of Parliament by means of messages, which he shall cause to be read and which shall not be the occasion for any debate. He can also give an address in front of the [[Congress of France]] in Versailles.
Outside sessions, Parliament shall be convened especially for this purpose.

''From 1875 to 2008, the President was prohibited from entering the houses of Parliament.''

'''Article 19'''
Acts of the President of the Republic, other than those provided for under articles 8 (first paragraph), 11, 12, 16, 18, 54, 56 and 61, shall be countersigned by the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] and, where required, by the appropriate ministers.

'''Article 49 Para 3''' allows the president to adopt a law on his authority. To this end, the prime minister goes before the lower and upper houses, reads out the bill to the legislators and closes with &quot;the administration engages its responsibility&quot; on the foregoing. Deprived of Gaullist party support halfway into his seven-year term spanning 1974 to 1981, Pres. Valéry Giscard d'Estaing relied heavily on this provision to stalemate Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac's attempt to bring him back under Gaullist control.

===Presidential amnesties===
There is a tradition of so-called &quot;presidential [[amnesty|amnesties]]&quot;, which are something of a misnomer: after the election of a president, and of a [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]] of the same party, parliament traditionally votes a law granting amnesty for some petty crimes. This practice has been increasingly criticized, particularly because it is believed to incite people to commit traffic offences in the months preceding the election. Such an amnesty law may also authorize the president to designate individuals who have committed certain categories of crimes to be offered amnesty, if certain conditions are met. Such individual measures have been criticized for the political [[patronage]] that they allow. Still, it is argued that such amnesty laws help reduce prison overpopulation. An amnesty law was passed in 2002; none have yet been passed as of January 2008.

The difference between an amnesty and a presidential pardon is that the former clears all subsequent effects of the sentencing, as though the crime had not been committed, while pardon simply relieves the sentenced individual from part or all of the remainder of the sentence.

==Criminal responsibility and impeachment==
Articles 67 and 68 organize the regime of criminal responsibility of the President. They were reformed by a 2007 constitutional act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000245803 |title=Loi constitutionnelle n° 2007-238 du 23 février 2007 portant modification du titre IX de la Constitution |language=French |publisher=Legifrance.gouv.fr |date= |accessdate=2011-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to clarify a situation that previously resulted in legal controversies.&lt;ref&gt;For all this section, see Articles 67 and 68 and ''[http://www.cairn.info/revue-francaise-de-droit-constitutionnel-2002-1.htm La responsabilité pénale du président de la République]'', Revue française de droit constitutionnel, n° 49 –2002/1, [[P.U.F.]], ISBN 9782130527893&lt;/ref&gt;

The President of the Republic enjoys [[Sovereign immunity|immunity]] during his term: he cannot be requested to testify before any jurisdiction, he cannot be prosecuted, etc. However, the [[statute of limitation]] is suspended during his term, and enquiries and prosecutions can be restarted, at the latest one month after he leaves office.

The President is [[irresponsibility|irresponsible]] for his actions in his official capacity, except for prosecution before the [[International Criminal Court]] and impeachment. [[Impeachment]] can be pronounced by the High Court, a special court convened from both houses of Parliament on the proposal of either House, should the president have failed to discharge his duties in a way that evidently precludes the continuation of his term.

==Election==
{{See|Elections in France}}

Since [[French presidential election referendum, 1962|a 1962 referendum]], the President of France has been directly elected by [[universal suffrage]]; it was previously elected by an [[electoral college]].
Following [[Referendum on the reduction of the mandate of the President of the French Republic, 2000|a 2000 referendum]], the length of the term was reduced from 7 to 5 years; the first election to a shorter term was held in 2002. President Chirac was first elected in 1995 and again in 2002. There was no term limit, so Chirac could have run again, but chose not to. He was succeeded by [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] on 16 May 2007.
Since the [[French constitutional law of 23 July 2008|constitutional law of 23 July 2008]], a president cannot serve more than two consecutive terms. [[François Mitterrand]] and [[Jacques Chirac]] are the only Presidents to date who have served a full two terms (14 years for the former, 12 years for the latter).

In order to be admitted as an official candidate, potential candidates must receive signed presentations (informally known as ''parrainages'', for &quot;godfathering&quot;) from more than 500 elected officials, mostly mayors. These officials must be from at least 30 ''[[département]]s'' or overseas collectivities, and no more than 10% of them should be from the same ''département'' or collectivity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/texteconsolide/PPEAG.htm Law 62-1292 of 6 November 1962], article 4&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, each official may present only one candidate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/texteconsolide/MEHFY.htm Decree 2001-213 of 8 November 2001], article 6&lt;/ref&gt;

There are approximately 45,000 elected officials that are on the list of such officials, including around 36,000 mayors.

Spending and financing of campaigns and political parties are highly regulated. There is a cap on spending, at approximately 20&amp;nbsp;million euros, and government public financing of 50% of spending if the candidate scores more than 5%. If the candidate receives less than 5% of the vote, the government funds €800,000 to the party (€150,000 paid in advance)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metrofrance.com/fr/article/afp/2007/04/24/070424142028_h2o7rf6h/index.xml Dépenses de campagne: énorme ardoise pour LO, la LCR s'en tire sans déficit], ''[[Metro International|Metro France]]'', 24 April 2007 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising on TV is forbidden but official time is given to candidates on public TV. An independent agency regulates election and party financing.

French presidential elections are conducted via [[Two-round system|run-off voting]] which ensures that the elected President always obtains a majority: if no candidate receives a majority of votes in the first round of voting, the two highest-scoring candidates arrive at a run-off. After the president is elected, he goes through a solemn [[investiture]] ceremony called a &quot;''passation des pouvoirs''&quot; (&quot;handing over of powers&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elysee.fr/junior/faq/faq.htm#5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Succession and incapacity==
Upon the death or resignation of the President, the President of the [[French Senate|Senate]] acts as interim president.&lt;ref&gt;The exact title is &quot;President of the Senate, exercising provisionally the functions of the President of the Republic&quot;; see how Alain Poher is referred to on signing statutes into law, e.g. [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jopdf/common/jo_pdf.jsp?numJO=0&amp;dateJO=19690510&amp;numTexte=&amp;pageDebut=04675&amp;pageFin= law 69-412]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alain Poher]] is the only person to have served this temporary position. The first time was in 1969 after [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s resignation and a second time in 1974 after [[Georges Pompidou]]'s death. It is important to note that, in this situation, the President of the Senate became an Interim President of the Republic; they do not become the new President of the Republic as elected and therefore do not have to resign from their position as President of the Senate. In spite of his title as Interim President of the Republic, Poher is regarded in France as a former President and is listed in the presidents' gallery on elysee.fr (the President's official site). This is in contrast to acting presidents from the Third Republic.

The first round of a new presidential election must be organized no sooner than twenty days and no later than thirty-five days following the vacancy of the presidency. Because fifteen days can separate the first and second rounds of a presidential election, this means that the President of the Senate can only act as President of the Republic for a maximum period of fifty days. During this period of Interim president is not allowed to dismiss the national assembly nor are they allowed to call for a referendum or initiate any constitutional changes.

If there is no acting president of the senate, the powers of the president of the republic are exercised by the &quot;Gouvernement&quot;, meaning the Cabinet. This has been interpreted by some constitutional academics as meaning first the Prime Minister and, if he is himself not able to act, the members of the cabinet in the order of the list of the decree that nominated them. This is in fact unlikely to happen, because if the president of the Senate is not able to act, the Senate will normally name a new president of the Senate, that will act as President of the Republic.

During the [[Third French Republic]] the President of the Council of Ministers acted as President whenever office was vacant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mjp.univ-perp.fr/france/co1875.htm#pp Loi du 25 février 1875 relative à l'organisation des pouvoirs publics], article 7: In case of a vacancy due to a decease or for any cause, the two houses of Parliament elect a new president. In the meantime, the executive power is vested in the council of ministers.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to article 7 of the Constitution, if the presidency becomes vacant for any reason, or if the president becomes incapacitated, upon the request of the ''gouvernement'', the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] may rule, by a majority vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006529987&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069199 Ordonnance n°58-1067 du 7 novembre 1958] portant loi organique sur le Conseil constitutionnel&lt;/ref&gt; that the presidency is to be temporarily assumed by the President of the Senate. If the Council rules that the incapacity is permanent, the same procedure as for the resignation is applied, as described above.

If the President cannot attend meetings, including meetings of the Council of Ministers, he can ask the Prime Minister to attend in his stead (Constitution, article 21). This clause has been applied by presidents travelling abroad, ill, or undergoing surgery.

==Pay and official residences==
The President of the Republic is paid a salary according to a pay grade defined in comparison to the pay grades of the most seniors members of the [[French Civil Service]] (&quot;out of scale&quot;, ''hors échelle'', those whose pay grades are known as letters and not as numeric indices). In addition he is paid a residence stipend of 3%, and a function stipend of 25% on top of the salary and residence indemnity. This gross salary and these indemnities are the same as those of the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]], and are 50% higher than the highest paid to other members of the government,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000774848&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000017924333&amp;dateTexte=20090729 Loi n°2002-1050 du 6 août 2002 de Finances rectificative pour 2002], as amended&lt;/ref&gt; which is itself defined as twice the average of the highest (pay grade G) and the lowest (pay grade A1) salaries in the &quot;out of scale&quot; pay grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006213505&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000005633245&amp;dateTexte=20090729 |title=Décret n°2002-1058 du 6 août 2002 relatif au traitement des membres du Gouvernement, art. 1 |language=French |publisher=Legifrance.gouv.fr |date=2002-08-06 |accessdate=2011-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the 2008 &quot;out of scale&quot; pay grades&lt;ref&gt;[http://costkiller.net/salaires/salaires-fonction-publique.htm Grille de salaires de la fonction publique],&lt;/ref&gt; this amounts to a monthly pay of €20,963, which fits the €19,000 quoted to the press in early 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politique.net/2008022801-le-salaire-du-premier-ministre-a-double-depuis-2002.htm Le salaire du Premier ministre a doublé depuis 2002], citing an interview given by [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] to ''[[Le Parisien]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Using the pay grades starting from 1 July 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000020815910 Décret n° 2009-824] du 3 juillet 2009 portant majoration à compter du 1er juillet 2009 de la rémunération des personnels civils et militaires de l'Etat, des personnels des collectivités territoriales et des établissements publics d'hospitalisation et portant attribution de points d'indice majoré&lt;/ref&gt; this amounts to a gross monthly pay of €21,131.

The salary and the residence stipend are taxable for [[income tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069577&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000018620290&amp;dateTexte=20090729 |title=General tax code, art. 80 undecies A |language=French|publisher=Legifrance.gouv.fr |date= |accessdate=2011-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official residence and office of the president is the [[Élysée Palace]] in Paris. Other presidential residences include:
*the ''[[Fort de Brégançon]]'', in southeastern France, is the current official presidential vacationing residence;
*the ''[[Hôtel de Marigny]]''; standing next to the Élysée Palace, houses foreign official guests;
*the ''[[Château de Rambouillet]]'' is normally open to visitors when not used for (rare) official meetings;
*the ''Domaine National de [[Château de Marly|Marly]]'' is normally open to visitors when not used for (rare) official meetings;
*the ''Domaine de Souzy-la-Briche'', not a historical monument, is a private residence.

==Former Presidents==
{{See|List of Presidents of France}}
As of 2011 there were two living former Presidents:
*[[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] (served 1974–1981)
*[[Jacques Chirac]] (served 1995–2007)

According to French law, Former Presidents have guaranteed lifetime pension defined according to the pay grade of the [[Council of State (France)|Councillors of State]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006272630 Loi n°55–366 du 3 avril 1955] relative au développement des crédits affectés aux dépenses du ministère des finances et des affaires économiques pour l'exercice 1955&lt;/ref&gt; a courtesy diplomatic passport,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000020278243 Arrêté du 11 février 2009 relatif au passeport diplomatique], article 1&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to the French Constitution (Article 56), membership of the Constitutional Council.

They also get personnel, an apartment and/or office, and other amenities, though the legal basis for these is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;The current system for providing personnel and other amenities to the former French presidents was devised in 1981 by [[Michel Charasse]], then advisor to president [[François Mitterrand]], in order to care for former president [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] and the widow of former president [[Georges Pompidou]]. See [[French Senate|Senate]], [http://www.senat.fr/seances/s200806/s20080619/s20080619005.html 19 June 2008 Proceedings]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, according to an answer by the services of the Prime Minister to a question from member of the National Assembly [[René Dosière]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://questions.assemblee-nationale.fr/q13/13-140QE.htm Question #140], answer published in the [[Journal Officiel de la République Française]] on 24 June 2008 page: 5368&lt;/ref&gt; these facilities comprised: a security detail, a car with a [[chauffeur]], office or housing space, maintained by the State. Two people service this space. In addition, the State funds 7 permanent collaborators.

==Presidential spouse==
{{See|Wife of the President of the French Republic}}
There is no official status or title such as '[[First Lady]]' for the spouse of the President under the French constitution. Charity work has traditionally been the main task of French presidential spouses under the Third, Fourth and Fifth Republics.

==History==
Under the [[French Third Republic|Third]] and [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]], which were [[parliamentary system]]s, the office of President of the Republic was a largely ceremonial and powerless one.

The constitution of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] greatly increased the President's powers. A [[French presidential election referendum, 1962|1962 referendum]] changed the constitution, so that the President would be directly elected by universal suffrage and not by the Parliament.

In 2000, a [[French constitutional referendum, 2000|referendum]] shortened the presidential term from seven years to five years.

A maximum of two consecutive terms was imposed after the [[French constitutional law of 23 July 2008|2008 constitutional reform]].

The '''Rally for the Republic''' ({{lang-fr|Rassemblement pour la République}}, '''RPR'''), was a French right-wing [[political party]]. Originating from the [[Union of Democrats for the Republic]] (''Union des Démocrates pour la République'', UDR), it was founded by [[Jacques Chirac]] in 1976 and presented itself as the heir of [[Gaullism]]. On 21 September 2002, the RPR was merged into the Union for the Presidential Majority (''Union pour la majorité présidentielle''), later renamed the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (''Union pour un mouvement populaire'', '''UMP''').

==History==
===The defense of the Gaullist identity against President Giscard d'Estaing (1976–1981)===

In 1974, the divisions in the Gaullist movement permitted the election of [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] to the Presidency of the French Republic. Representing the pro-European and [[Orleanist]] centre-right, he was the first non-Gaullist rising to the head of the state since the beginning of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] in 1958. However, the Gaullist Party remained the main force in parliament and [[Jacques Chirac]] was appointed Prime Minister. Chirac resigned in August 1976 and in December 1976 the RPR was created in order to restore the Gaullist domination over the republican institutions.

Though retaining its support for the president's government, the RPR criticized the executive duo composed of President Giscard d'Estaing and Prime Minister [[Raymond Barre]]. Its first master stroke was in March 1977 the election of Chirac as Mayor of Paris against [[Michel d'Ornano]], a close friend of President Giscard d'Estaing. Nevertheless, it was faced with the creation of the [[Union for French Democracy]] (UDF), a confederation of the parties supporting the presidential policies and which competed for the leadership over the right. Consequently, the stake of the [[French legislative election, 1978|1978 legislative election]] was not only the victory of the right over the left, but the domination of the RPR over the UDF in the parliamentary majority.

Given the increasing unpopularity of the executive duo, and with a view to the next presidential election, the RPR became more and more critical. In December 1978, six months before the European Parliament election, the ''Call of Cochin'' signed by Chirac denounced the appropriation of France by &quot;the foreign party,&quot; which sacrificed the national interests and the independence of the country in order to build a federal Europe. This accusation clearly targeted Giscard d'Estaing. RPR leaders contrasted this as coming from the social doctrine of Gaullism as opposed to a perceived liberalism on the part of the President.

As RPR candidate at the [[French presidential election, 1981|1981 presidential election]], Chirac formulated vigorous condemnations of President [[Giscard d'Estaing]], who ran for a second term. Eliminated in the first round, Chirac refused to give an endorsement for the second round, though he did say privately that he would vote for Giscard d'Estaing. In fact, the RPR was expected to work for the defeat of the incumbent president.

[[Image:RPR old logo.png|thumb|left|The first logo of the RPR recalls the Gaullist inheritance with the [[Cross of Lorraine]], symbol of the [[Free French]], drawn on top of the [[phrygian cap]] (normally worn by [[Marianne]]).]]

===The opposition to President Mitterrand and the abandonment of the Gaullist doctrine (1981–1995)===
After 1981, the RPR opposed with energy the policy of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] President [[François Mitterrand]] and the left-wing governments. The RPR denounced the plan of [[nationalization]]s as the setting up of a &quot;collectivist society&quot;. Impressed by the electoral success of [[New Right]] conservatives led by [[Ronald Reagan]] in the United States of America and by [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the United Kingdom, it gradually abandoned the Gaullist doctrine, claiming a less control of the state in economy. During its 1983 congress, it advocated a [[economic liberalism|liberal economic]] programme and the pursuit of the European construction, accepting the supranationality.

This new political line contributed to the reconciliation between the RPR and the UDF. In this, they presented a common list at the 1984 European Parliament election and a platform to prepare the winning [[French legislative election, 1986|1986 legislative election]]. However, a rivalry appeared between Jacques Chirac and Raymond Barre who competed for the right-wing leadership with a view to the next presidential election. Futhemore, if the right-wing coalition benefited from the failures of the Socialist power, it was confronted with the emergence of the [[National Front (France)|National Front]] in the far right. The RPR was divided about the possibility of alliance with this party.

In 1986, being the leader of the main party of the new parliamentary majority and accepting the principle of the &quot;[[Cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]]&quot; with President Mitterrand (contrary to Barre), Chirac became again Prime Minister. He led a liberal economic policy inspired by [[Anglosphere|Anglo-Saxon]] examples, selling a lot of public companies, abolishing the [[wealth tax]]. His Interior Minister [[Charles Pasqua]] led a policy of restriction of immigration. If Chirac acceded in the second round of the [[French presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]] despite Raymond Barre's candidacy, he was defeated by Mitterrand.

While the RPR returned in the opposition, the leadership of Chirac was challenged by younger politicians who wished to renew the right. Furthemore, the abandonment of the Gaullist doctrine was criticized by [[Charles Pasqua]] and [[Philippe Séguin]]. They tried to take him the RPR lead in 1990, in vain. However, the division re-appeared with the 1992 Maastricht referendum. Chirac voted &quot;yes&quot; whereas Séguin and Pasqua campaigned for &quot;no&quot;.

The &quot;[[Union for France]]&quot;, a RPR/UDF coalition, won the [[French legislative election, 1993|1993 legislative election]]. Chirac refused to re-cohabitate with Mitterrand, and [[Edouard Balladur]] became prime minister. Balladur promised that he would not be a candidate at the [[French presidential election, 1995|1995 presidential election]]. Nevertheless, polls indicated Balladur was the favorite in the presidential race and, furthermore, he was supported by the most part of the right-wing politicians. He decided finally to run against Chirac. However, they claimed that they remained friends for 30 years.

The Socialists being weakened after the 14 years of Mitterrand's presidency, the main competition was within the right, between Balladur and Chirac, two Neo-Gaullists. Balladur proposed a liberal program and took advantage of the &quot;positive results&quot; of his cabinet, whereas Chirac advocated [[Keynesian economics]] to reduce the &quot;social fracture&quot; and criticized the &quot;dominant ideas&quot;, targeting Balladur. Chirac won the [[French presidential election, 1995|1995 presidential election]].

===The RPR became the presidential party (1995–2002)===
After his election as [[President of France]], Jacques Chirac nominated [[Alain Juppé]], &quot;the best among us&quot; according to him, as Prime Minister. But the majority of the personalities who had supported Balladur during the presidential campaign were excluded from the government. The ''balladuriens'' (such as [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]) were completely isolated in the party too.

In November 1995, Prime Minister [[Alain Juppé]] announced a plan to reform the French [[welfare state]] which sparked wide social conflict. The executive duo became very unpopular and some months later President Chirac dissolved the National Assembly. His supporters lost the [[French legislative election, 1997|1997 legislative election]]. Consequently, he was forced to cohabitate with a left-wing cabinet led by [[Lionel Jospin]] until 2002.

Séguin succeeded to Juppé as RPR leader, but he criticized the ascendancy of President Chirac over the party. He resigned during the 1999 European campaign while Pasqua presented a dissident list to advocate the Gaullist idea of a &quot;Europe of nations&quot;. Pasqua founded the [[Rally for France]] (''Rassemblement pour la France'' or '''RPF''') and obtained more votes than the RPR official list led by [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]. [[Michèle Alliot-Marie]], former Minister of Youth and sports, was elected RPR leader, against the will of President Chirac who supported covertly an unfamous candidate [[Jean-Paul Delevoye]]. Besides, a lot of scandals appeared about the financing of the RPR. For instance, the party was suspected to pay its employees with the funds of Paris's municipality. The RPR lost the mayoralty of Paris in 2001, in aid of the left.

Before the [[French presidential election, 2002|2002 presidential election]], both RPR and non-RPR supporters of Chirac gathered in an association: the &quot;Union on the move&quot;. It became the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (''Union pour un mouvement populaire'' or '''UMP''') after the 21 April 2002 electoral shock. Chirac was re-elected and the new party won the [[French legislative election, 2002|legislative election]].

Prior to its replacement by the UMP, the RPR had been increasingly embroiled in judicial proceedings following from the [[corruption scandals in the Paris region]]. Its former secretary-general [[Alain Juppé]] was sentenced in 2004 for a related felony. In 2007, a formal judicial investigation was opened against Jacques Chirac himself.

The '''Union for a Popular Movement''' ({{lang-fr|Union pour un Mouvement Populaire}}, UMP) is a [[centre-right]]&lt;ref name=&quot;centreright&quot;/&gt; [[List of political parties in France|political party in France]], being one of the two [[major party|major]] contemporary political parties in the country along with the center-left [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (PS). The UMP was formed in 2002 as a merger of several centre-right parties under President [[Jacques Chirac]]. 

Its current leader [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] was elected [[President of France]] in 2007, and the party enjoys an [[absolute majority]] in the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]], while the plurality in the [[French Senate|Senate]] is held by the Socialists and their allies. [[Jean-François Copé]] is the party secretary-general. The UMP is a member of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP), the [[Centrist Democrat International]] (CDI) and the [[International Democrat Union]] (IDU).

==History==
===Background===
Since the 1980s, the political groups of the parliamentary right joined forces around the values of economic liberalism and the building of Europe. Their rivalries had contributed to their defeat in the [[French legislative election, 1981|1981]] and [[French legislative election, 1988|1988]] elections.

Before the [[French legislative election, 1993|1993 legislative election]], the Gaullist-conservative [[Rally for the Republic]] (RPR) and the centrist [[Union for French Democracy]] (UDF) formed an electoral alliance, the [[Union for France]]. However, at the [[French presidential election, 1995|1995 presidential campaign]] they were both divided between followers of [[Jacques Chirac]], who was eventually elected, and supporters of [[Edouard Balladur]]. After their defeat in the [[French legislative election, 1997|1997 legislative election]], RPR and UDF created the [[Alliance for France]] in order to coordinate the action of their parliamentary groups.

===Foundation and early years===
Before the [[French presidential election, 2002|2002 presidential campaign]], the supporters of President [[Jacques Chirac]] who were divided in three right-wing parliamentary parties founded an association named '''Union on the Move''' (''Union en mouvement'').&lt;ref name=&quot;ump-history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.france-politique.fr/histoire-ump.htm|publisher=France politique|title = chronologie UMP}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Chirac's re-election, in order to fight together the [[French legislative election, 2002|legislative election]], the '''Union for the Presidential Majority''' (''Union pour la majorité présidentielle'') was created. It was re-named &quot;Union for a Popular Movement&quot; some months later, establishing the UMP as a permanent organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;ump-history&quot;/&gt; 

The UMP was founded as a merger of the Gaullist-conservative [[Rally for the Republic]] (RPR), the conservative-liberal [[Liberal Democracy (France)|Liberal Democracy]] (DL), a sizeable portion of the centrist [[Union for French Democracy]] (UDF), more precisely the UDF's Christian Democrats (such as [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]] and [[Jacques Barrot]]), the social-liberal [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]] and the centrist [[Popular Party for French Democracy]] (both associate parties of the UDF until 2002). The UMP was thus the merger of four major French political families: [[Gaullism]], Liberalism (also known as ''Republicanism'' in France), [[Christian Democracy]] (''[[Popolarismo|Popularism]]'') and [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicalism]].

As indicated by its initial name, the UMP generally supported the policies of President Chirac. However, in 2004, the party showed increasing signs of independence. The unpopularity with the electorate of Jacques Chirac and [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]]'s government led most members of the UMP to support [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], a rival of Chirac. On the issues, the party under Sarkozy publicly disapproved of [[Turkey]]'s proposed membership in the European Union, which Chirac had previously endorsed several times publicly, and generally took a more right-wing position.

At the [[French regional elections, 2004|2004 regional elections]] the UMP suffered a heavy blow, winning the presidencies of only 2 out of 22 regions in metropolitan France ([[Alsace]] and [[Corsica]]) and only half of the departments (the right had previously won numerous departmental presidencies). At the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (France)|2004 European Parliament election]] in June the party also suffered a heavy blow, with only 16.6% of the vote, far behind the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]], and only 16 seats. This results remains the UMP's lowest point.

The first president of the UMP, [[Alain Juppé]], a close associate of Jacques Chirac, resigned on 15 July 2004 after being convicted of [[political corruption]] in January of the same year. On 29 November 2004, Nicolas Sarkozy announced that he would take over the presidency of the UMP and resign his position as [[Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industry (France)|finance minister]], ending months of speculation. The failure of the [[French European Constitution referendum, 2005|referendum on the European Constitution]] of 25 May 2005 led to the fall of the government of Jean-Pierre Raffarin and to the formation of a new cabinet, presided by another UMP politician, [[Dominique de Villepin]].

===Nicolas Sarkozy===
On 22 April 2007 [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] won the plurality of votes in the first round of the [[French presidential election, 2007|2007 presidential election]]. On 6 May he faced the Socialist candidate [[Ségolène Royal]] in the second round and won, garnering 53.1% of the vote. As a consequence, he resigned from the presidency of the UMP on 14 May 2007, two days before becoming President of the French Republic. [[François Fillon]] was appointed Prime Minister. On 17 June, at a [[French legislative election, 2007|legislative election]], the UMP gained a majority in the National Assembly with 313 out of 577 seats, though it was less than expected.

At the 2008 [[French municipal elections, 2008|municipal]] and [[French cantonal elections, 2008|cantonal]] elections the party suffered a big blow, losing numerous cities, such as [[Toulouse]] and [[Strasbourg]], as well as 8 departmental presidencies to the left. [[Xavier Bertrand]] was selected as secretary-general of the party in late 2008 to replace [[Patrick Devedjian]], who resigned to take up a cabinet position. At the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (France)|2009 European Parliament election]], the party ran a common &quot;Presidential Majority&quot; list with the smaller [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]] as well as [[New Centre]] and [[Modern Left]]. The UMP list won 27.9%, a remarkably good result for a governing party in off-year &quot;mid-term&quot; elections, and elected 29 MEPs, significantly improving on the UMP's poor result in the 2004 election – also an off-year election. However, in the [[French regional elections, 2010|2010 regional election]] the UMP obtained a very poor result with only 26.0% of votes, losing Corsica and retaining only Alsace.

In a cabinet reshuffle in November 2010, which disappointed centrists within and outside the UMP, François Fillon was confirmed Prime Minister and [[Alain Juppé]] re-joined the government after three years out of politics. Among those who quit the cabinet there were [[Bernard Kouchner]], [[Hervé Morin]] and, above all, [[Jean-Louis Borloo]]. Xavier Bertrand, who re-joined the government, was replaced as general-secretary of the UMP by [[Jean-François Copé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=lefigaro.fr |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2010/11/14/01002-20101114ARTFIG00213-remaniement-le-gouvernement-fillon-iii-ancre-a-droite-pour-2012.php |title=Le Figaro – Politique : Remaniement : le gouvernement Fillon III ancré à droite pour 2012 |work=Le Figaro |location=France |date= |accessdate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=lefigaro.fr |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2010/11/15/01002-20101115ARTFIG00554-borloo-et-morin-sonnent-la-revolte-des-centristes.php |title=Le Figaro – Politique : Borloo et Morin sonnent la révolte des centristes |work=Le Figaro |location=France |date=16 November 2010 |accessdate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, during a party congress, the Radical Party, led by Borloo, decided to leave the UMP and launch [[The Alliance (France)|The Alliance]], a new centrist coalition.&lt;ref&gt;http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualite/politique/20110514.OBS3117/le-parti-radical-vote-son-independance-vis-a-vis-de-l-ump.html/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.91secondes.fr/alliance-republicaine-ecologique-et-sociale-ares&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.germain-isern.com/2011/05/maurice-leroy-croit-en-une-grande.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.partiradical.net/images/stories/evenement/invitationlancementdelalliance.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular support==
The UMP's electoral base reflects that of the old [[Rally for the Republic]] and, in some cases, that of the [[Union for French Democracy]]. In the 2007 presidential election, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] performed best in the east of France – particularly [[Alsace]] (36.2%); [[Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur]] (37.0%) – the wealthy coastal [[Departments of France|department]] of the [[Alpes-Maritimes]] (43.6%) was his best department in France; [[Champagne-Ardenne]] (32.7%) and [[Rhône-Alpes]] (32.7%). These areas were among far-right candidate [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]'s best regions in 2002 and are conservative on issues such as immigration. Sarkozy obviously received a lot of votes from voters who had supported the far-right in April 2002. For example, in the [[Alpes-Maritimes]], Sarkozy performed 21.6% better than Chirac did in 2002 while Le Pen lost 12.6% in five years.&lt;ref name=&quot;ifop&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ifop.com/?option=com_publication&amp;type=publication&amp;id=31|title= IFOP analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarkozy also appealed more than average to [[blue-collar]] workers in regions such as northern [[Meurthe-et-Moselle]] and the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]], although most of these regions, despite his gains, remain reliably left-wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://cdsp.sciences-po.fr/AE.php|title= Results |publisher=CDSP website}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party is also strong in every election in very wealthy suburban or coastal (and, in some cases, urban) areas such as [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] (72.6% for Sarkozy in the first round),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/PR2007/053/035/5335.html|title= Ministry of the Interior results page}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint-Tropez]] (54.79%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/PR2007/093/083/83119.html|title= Ministry of the Interior results page}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cannes]] (48.19%)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/PR2007/093/006/06029.html|title= Ministry of the Interior results page}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Marcq-en-Barœul]] (47.35%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/PR2007/031/059/59378.html|title= Ministry of the Interior results page}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is strong in most rural areas, like most conservative parties in the world, but this does not extend to the rural areas of the south of France, areas which are old strongholds of [[republicanism|republican]] and secular ideals. However, in old &quot;clerical&quot; Catholic rural areas, such as parts of [[Lozère]] or [[Cantal]], it is very strong, as was the [[Union for French Democracy]] (UDF) in its hey day.

However, the UMP does poorly in one of the UDF's best regions, [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]], where the decline of religious practice, a moderate electorate and urbanization has hurt the UMP and also the UDF. Nicolas Sarkozy performed relatively poorly in departments with a large share of moderate Christian democratic (often centrist or centre-right) voters, such as [[Lozère]] where the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] candidate [[Ségolène Royal]] performed better (44.3%) than [[François Mitterrand]] had in his 1988 left-wing landslide (43.1%). While former President [[Jacques Chirac]], the right's strongman in normally left-wing [[Corrèze]] had always done very well in Corrèze and the surrounding departments, Sarkozy did much poorly and actually lost the department in the 2007 runoff. However, in the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (France)|2009 European election]], the UMP's results in those departments were superior to Sarkozy's first round result (nationally, they were 4% lower).&lt;ref name=&quot;ifop&quot; /&gt;

===Presidents===
*[[Alain Juppé]] (2002–2004)
*[[Nicolas Sarkozy]] (2004–2007)
*collegial leadership (2007–present)

When Nicolas Sarkozy became [[President of France]] in 2007, the office of president of the party was replaced by a collegial leadership composed of the secretary-general and the vice presidents of the party. In July 2007 Jean-Claude Gaudin, the party's acting president, explained that &quot;Nicolas Sarkozy remains, morally, president of the UMP&quot; and the party endorsed this statement by not choosing a successor to Sarkozy. As the post of president of the UMP is, for the moment, abolished, the secretary-general is the ''de facto'' leader of the UMP.

'''Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba''' ({{IPA-es|alˈfɾeðo ˈpeɾeθ ruβalˈkaβa}}; born 28 July 1951) is a Spanish politician who is Secretary General of the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) and leader of the opposition in the Spanish Parliament. He served in the government of Spain as Minister of Education from 1992 to 1993 and as Minister of the Interior from 2006 to 2011; in addition, he was First Deputy Prime Minister from 2010 to 2011.

He was born in [[Solares]] village, municipality of [[Medio Cudeyo]], in [[Cantabria]] region. He obtained a [[doctorate]] in chemistry at [[Complutense University]] in [[Madrid]], where he went on to become a professor of chemistry, specialising in reaction mechanisms in [[organic chemistry]]. He represented [[Toledo (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Toledo]] in Congress from 1993 to 1996, [[Madrid (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Madrid]] from 1996 until 2004, [[Cantabria (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Cantabria]] from 2004 to 2008 and, despite not being [[Andalusian people|Andalusian]], was put forward for the [[safe seat|safe parliamentary seat]] of [[Cádiz (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Cádiz]] in the 2008 election, which he won. 

Rubalcaba was appointed Minister of Education and Science in 1992 by President [[Felipe González]]. The following year he was made Minister of the President's office and Relationships with Congress, an office he had to abandon in 1996 when his party lost the elections. In the successful campaign of 2004 he worked as chief strategist. When [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] formed the new government, Rubalcaba was appointed Majority leader until 2006 when he succeeded [[José Antonio Alonso]] as Interior Minister. On October 2010 he added to his functions the position of First Deputy Prime Minister and Spokesperson of the government. As it became assumed that President Zapatero was not going to seek reelection he became favorite to succeed him with [[Carme Chacón]] as his only rival in the primaries. Nevertheless, in May 2011, Chacón announced that she was withdrawing from the race and in June the Party announced that no other candidate had filed and Rubalcaba became the PSOE's Prime Ministerial candidate for the [[Spanish general election, 2011|2011 general elections]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/18530051?story_id=18530051 Exit plan:The Socialists contemplate who would be their best new leader] The Economist 7 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 July 2011, he resigned from his duties in the government in order to focus on the [[Spanish general election, 2011|general election campaign]], which he lost getting the worst results in PSOE's history.

He filed to succeed José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero as PSOE's General Secretary and won the vote, held in February 2012. He received 487 votes against 465 for Carme Chacón.&lt;ref&gt;elperiodicodeaqui.com http://www.elperiodicodeaqui.com/noticia/alfredo-perez-rubalcaba-gana-carme-chacon-por-22-votos-diferencia/15251&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Spanish '''Congress of Deputies''' ({{lang-es|Congreso de los Diputados|links=no}}) is the lower house of the [[Cortes Generales]], Spain's [[legislative branch]]. It has 350 members, elected by popular vote on block lists by [[proportional representation]] in [[constituency|constituencies]] matching the Spanish [[Provinces of Spain|province]]s using the [[D'Hondt method]]. Deputies serve four-year terms. The ''[[President of the Congress of Deputies]]'' is the analogue to a Speaker and presides over debates in Spain's lower chamber of parliament.

In the Congress, members of the Parliament from the political parties, or groups of parties, form parliamentary groups. Groups must be formed by, at least, 15 MPs, but a group can also be formed with only five MPs if the parties in it got, at least, 5% of the nationwide vote, or 15% of the votes in the constituencies they run for seats.

The MPs belonging to parties who can't create their own parliamentary group shall form the Mixed Group.&lt;ref&gt;`[http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/GruPar/InfoGruPar Information about Parliamentary Groups] - Congress of Deputies of Spain&lt;/ref&gt; The composition of the 10th term Congress is:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/GruPar Parliamentary Groups] - Congress of Deputies of Spain&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francoist Spain''' refers to a period of [[history of Spain|Spanish history]] between 1936 and 1975 when [[Spain]] was under the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[dictatorship]] of [[Francisco Franco]]. 

The regime was formed on 1 October 1936{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} by Francisco Franco and the National Defense Committee (a faction of the Spanish army rebelling against the Republic). The regime was entrenched upon the victory in the [[Spanish Civil War]], which the regime called the ''Guerra de Liberación Nacional'', of the rebel ''Nacionales'' coalition. Besides the internal support, Franco's rebellion had been backed from abroad by [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]], while the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was  backed by the Stalinist [[Soviet Union]]. 

At the end of the  Spanish Civil War, according to the calculations of the regime, there were more than 270,000 men and women held in the regime's prisons and some 500,000 fled into exile. Large numbers of those captured were returned to Spain or interned in Nazi concentration camps as ''stateless enemies''. Between six and seven thousand exiles from Spain died in [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]].  It has been estimated that more than 200,000 Spaniards died in the first years of the dictatorship, from 1940–42, as a result of political repression, hunger and disease related to the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;The Splintering of Spain, p2-3 ISBN , Cambridge University Press, 9-780521-821780&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Nacionales''  established a [[single-party state|single party]] authoritarian state under the undisputed leadership of Franco. Though Spain was officially neutral through World War Two, it did send a special Division of troops to Russia to aid the Germans, and its pro-Axis stance led to it being isolated after the collapse of the Axis powers. This changed with the new [[Cold War]] that quickly followed the end of hostilities in 1945, in the face of which Franco's strong [[anti-communism]] naturally tilted its régime to ally with the [[United States]], and provided ideal ground for the continuation of Franco's anti-communist regime. Independent political parties and trade unions were banned throughout the duration of the dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;The Splintering of Spain,  Cambridge University Press, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

A decree of Economic Stabilisation was introduced in 1959, opening the way for massive foreign investment - &quot; a watershed in post-war economic, social and ideological ''normalisation'' leading to extraordinarily rapid economic growth&quot;, that marked Spain's &quot;participation in the Europe-wide post-war economic normality centred on mass consumption and consensus, in contrast to the concurrent reality of the Soviet bloc.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The Splintering of Spain, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; Official discourse on the Civil War had shifted also in this time, from the ''crusade'' for the nation against a foreign invasion, an anti-Spain, towards a more conciliatory construction of the conflict as a fratricidal war, the mutual killing of brothers.

Spain was declared a [[monarchy|kingdom]] in 1947, but no monarch was designated. Franco reserved for himself the right to name the person to be king, and deliberately delayed the selection due to political considerations. The selection finally came in 1969, with the designation of [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos de Borbón]] as Franco's official successor.

With the death of Franco on 20 November 1975, Juan Carlos became the [[King of Spain]]. He immediately began the process of a [[Spanish transition to democracy|transition to democracy]], ending with Spain becoming a [[constitutional monarchy]] articulated by a [[parliamentary democracy]].

==Etymology and usage==
The formal name of Spain during the Franco era was the '''Spanish State''' ({{lang|es|''Estado Español''}}). In 1947, the state was formally proclaimed to be a monarchy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Shneidman |first=Jerome Lee |title=Spain &amp; Franco, 1949-59 |publisher= Facts on File, Inc |year=1973 |page=32 |isbn=0871961806}}&lt;/ref&gt; but international treaties continued after that date to refer to it as the ''Spanish State'' rather than as the ''Kingdom of Spain''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%202331/v2331.pdf United Nations, treaties], volume 2331&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20536/v536.pdf United Nations, treaties], volume 536&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Spanish Civil War broke out, the Nationalist forces immediately began using the form the ''Spanish State'' rather than the ''[[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]]'' or the ''Kingdom of Spain'', out of deference to the differing political sensibilities of the members of the Nationalist coalition, which included, amongst others, the anti-monarchic fascist [[Falangist]]s, and the rival conservative-monarchist [[Carlism|Carlist]]s and Legitimist parties.

Following the Second World War, both the Falangist and Carlist movements declined, while Franco's rule was consolidated. This allowed Franco to nominally restore the Spanish monarchy without any significant opposition.

==History==
{{History of Spain}}

===Establishment===
The Nationalist senior generals held an informal meeting in September 1936, where they elected [[Francisco Franco]] as leader of the Nationalists, with the rank of ''[[Generalissimo|Generalísimo]]'' (sometimes written in English as ''Generalissimo'', after the [[Fascist Italian]] fashion).  He was originally supposed to be only commander-in-chief, but after the death of [[Emilio Mola|General Emilio Mola]] (the initial leader of the movement) became head of state as well with nearly unlimited and absolute powers.

This provisional government ruled over the territories controlled by the Nationalists during the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]]. Its main political action during the war was the consolidation of the heterogeneous political forces that joined the rebellion into a [[single party]], the authoritarian [[Falange]].&lt;ref&gt;In full, the ''Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, the Nationalist government repressed Republican militants and sympathizers, as retaliation for the repression of clergy and Nationalist militants on the opposite side. Extrajudicial killings were widespread on both sides during the whole war. The retaliation continued right after the war, in part to punish war crimes committed under the Republican government, under a trial called ''Causa General''. Franco's government executed, jailed, or subjected to forced labor thousands of Republicans, but many of them were entirely innocent of anything other than the flimsiest support for the Republican cause, or merely being related to known Republicans. As a result thousands chose to go into exile, mostly in France and Mexico. Of those who fled to metropolitan France, many joined the [[French resistance]] against the Nazis. One such exile in metropolitan France was [[Lluís Companys]], President of the [[Generalitat de Catalunya|Catalan Government]]; he was subsequently arrested and extradited to Spain in September 1940 by [[Vichy France|the Pétain regime]], then executed after a military trial.

Many of those who had supported the Republic fled into exile. Spain lost thousands of doctors, nurses, teachers, lawyers, judges, professors, businessmen, artists, etc.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Many of those who had to stay lost their jobs or lost their rank. Sometimes those jobs were given to unskilled and even untrained personnel. This deprived the country of many of its brightest minds, and also of a very capable workforce. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}. However, this was done to keep Spain's citizens consistent with the ideals sought by the FET y de las JONS and Franco.

===World War II years (1939–1945)===
{{Main|Spain in World War II}}

In September 1939, [[World War II]] broke out in Europe. After the collapse of France in June 1940, Spain adopted a pro-Axis non-belligerency stance (for example, it offered Spanish naval facilities to German ships), and returned escaping Allied servicemen and fleeing resistance fighters to the Nazis, returning the favour paid by the Nazis when they had contributed forces including the Stuka dive bombers to support Franco and the Nationalists during the Civil War.

[[Adolf Hitler]] met Franco in [[Hendaye]], France (23 October 1940), to discuss the Spanish entry in the war joining the [[Axis Powers|Axis]]. Franco's demands (food, military equipment, [[Gibraltar]], [[French North Africa]], etc.) proved too much and no agreement was reached.

Contributing to the disagreement was an ongoing dispute over German mining rights in Spain. Some historians argue that Franco made demands that he knew Hitler would not accede to in order to stay out of the war. Other historians argue that he simply had nothing to offer the Germans. Franco did send volunteer troops to fight communism joining the Axis armies on the [[Eastern Front (WWII)|Eastern Front]] against the [[Soviet Union]]. The unit name was the [[División Azul]], or Blue Division, after the [[Falange]]'s party color, whose members were known as 'blueshirts'.  Franco returned to complete neutrality in 1943, when the tide of the war had turned decisively against Germany. However, [[Fulgencio Batista]] of [[Cuba]], despite the Cuban armed forces not being greatly involved in World War II, had suggested a joint [[United States|U.S.]]-[[Latin America]]n assault on Spain in order to overthrow the Franco regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,802544,00.html &quot;Batista's Boost&quot;], ''Time'', {{Nowrap|January 18}}, 1943. Retrieved {{Nowrap|March 2}}, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isolation (1945–1953)===
After the war, the Allies used Spain's ties to the Axis powers to keep it from joining the [[United Nations]]. Franco's government was seen, especially by Soviet countries but also by the Western allies, to be a remnant of the central European fascist regimes.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Under these circumstances, a UN resolution condemning Franco's government followed. The resolution encouraged countries to remove their ambassadors in Spain, and established the basis for measures against Spain if the government remained authoritarian. Only neighbouring Portugal, Ireland and a few Latin American, Arabian and Asian countries, refused to comply with this advice.

The consequence of all of this was the establishment of an [[embargo]] against the Francoist regime in 1946&amp;nbsp;— including the closure of the French border&amp;nbsp;— with very little success, as it boosted support for the regime. The isolation was represented by Franco's regime as a modern version of the [[Black Legend]], with the most fanatical partisans claiming it was a [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|machination]] of [[Jews]] and [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] against Catholic Spain. (Historian Vicente Carcel Orti asserts that [[Anticlericalism and Freemasonry|anticlerical Freemasons]] had in fact played a large part in the anti-Catholic acts of the prior Republican government since they held key government positions, including at least 183 deputies in the Cortes (the Spanish parliament), and thus were instrumental in the making of [[anti-Catholic]] laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Martyrs of Spain's Civil War&quot;&gt;Redzioch, Wlodzimierz (interviewing historian Vicente Carcel Orti) [http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=7999&amp;CFID=23811582&amp;CFTOKEN=60559071 The Martyrs of Spain's Civil War], Catholic Culture&lt;/ref&gt;) This impression of machination helped to rally significant popular support for the regime such as the large scale 1946 demonstration held in Madrid. In 1947, the president of Argentina, Juan Perón, ignored the UN embargo and sent his wife [[Eva Perón]] (Evita) with much needed food supplies.
After World War II, the Spanish economy was still in disarray. [[Rationing]] cards were still used as late as 1952. War and economic isolation prompted the regime to move towards [[autarky]], a movement warmly welcomed by Falangists. The tenets of the economy were: reduction of imports, self-sufficiency, state-controlled production and commercialization of first order goods, state-funded industry and construction of infrastructure&amp;nbsp;— heavily damaged during the Civil War&amp;nbsp;— through the use of improvised means.

In other aspects the regime continued showing its heavy-handedness when it withdrew the press credentials of six U.S. reporters in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,814792,00.html &quot;Censorship in Spain&quot; ''TIME'' April 30, 1951]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The end of isolation (1953–1959)===
[[Image:Franco eisenhower 1959 madrid.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Eisenhower and Franco in Spain in 1959]]
The increased tensions between the U.S. and the [[USSR]] in the 1950s led the American government to search for new allies in Europe. Franco's strong anti-Communist stance as well as the strategic location of Spain made the Spanish State a potential ally in the [[Cold War]].  This was demonstrated by the offer of the [[Blue Division]] to the U.S. in 1950, for service in the [[Korean War]], which was turned down.

Spain's international ostracism was finally broken in 1953 when Spain and the United States signed the [[Pact of Madrid]] in a series of agreements under which Spain received some financial benefits in the form of grants and loans in return for hosting American military bases (such as [[Naval Station Rota, Spain|Naval Station Rota]], opened in 1955). The same year, the Spanish government signed the ''[[Concordat of 1953|Concordat]]'' with the [[Holy See|Vatican]].

In 1955, Spanish wealth approached the pre-Civil War levels of 1935, leaving behind the disasters of the war and the struggle of isolation.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Helen and Labanyi, Jo (Eds.)

Spain. History]&lt;/ref&gt; Other Western European countries, including Italy, were from that point eager to restore good contacts with Francoist Spain.

Spain's gradual readmission to the international fold was given visible form with the visit of U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in December 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/trvl/pres/12794.htm Dwight D. Eisenhower&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Desarrollo'', the Spanish Miracle (1959–1973)===
[[Image:Seat 600 Granada.jpg|thumb|A SEAT 600.]]
{{Main|Spanish Miracle}}

The Spanish Miracle (''Desarrollo'') was the name given to the Spanish economic boom between 1959 and 1973. It is seen by some as the most remarkable positive legacy of the regime. During this period, Spain largely surpassed the per capita income that differentiates [[developed country|developed]] from [[underdeveloped countries]] and induced the development of a dominant [[middle class]].

The boom was bolstered by economic reforms promoted by the so-called &quot;[[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrat]]s&quot;, appointed by Franco, who pushed for public investment in infrastructure development, as recommended by the [[International Monetary Fund]]. The technocrats were a new breed of economists who replaced the old, prone to isolationism, [[Falangist]] guard.

The implementation of these policies took the form of development plans (''planes de Desarrollo'') and it was largely a success: Spain enjoyed the second highest growth rate in the world, just after Japan, and became the ninth [[List of largest economies in the world|largest economy in the world]], just after Canada.  Spain joined the industrialized world, leaving behind the poverty and endemic underdevelopment it had experienced since the loss of the [[Spanish Empire]] in the 19th century.
[[File:Spain After Franco.ogv|thumb|left|1971 newsreel film about Spain under Franco]] 
Although the economic growth produced noticeable improvements in Spanish living standards and the development of a middle class, Spain remained less economically advanced relative to the rest of Western Europe (with the exception of Portugal, Greece and Ireland). At the heyday of the Miracle, 1974, Spanish income per capita peaked at 79 percent of the Western European average, only to be reached again 25 years later, in 1999.

The 14 years of recovery led to an increase in (often unplanned) building on the periphery of the main Spanish cities to accommodate the new class of industrial workers brought by [[rural exodus]].

The icon of the ''Desarrollo'' was the [[SEAT 600]] (a license-built Italian [[Fiat]] [[Fiat 600|600]]) the first car for many Spanish working class families, produced by the Spanish factory [[SEAT]] or Sociedad Española de Automóviles de Turismo.

1969 also saw the Spanish government close the border with Gibraltar. Aircraft from Gibraltar were stopped from travelling to Spain or banned from using Spanish airspace. The border remained closed until the 1980s and air restrictions were only lifted in 2006.

===Franco's last years (1973–1975)===
The [[1973 oil crisis]] severely affected Spain, and brought the economic growth to a halt. This caused a new wave of strikes (nominally illegal at the time).

Franco's declining health during the early 1970s gave more power to Admiral [[Luis Carrero Blanco]], allegedly his caretaker and guardian of young Juan Carlos, the future king. Nevertheless, [[ETA]] was planning to assassinate Blanco, and finally, the commando led by [[Argala]], after two years of work, exploded a bomb which was located in a tunnel dig under the road he used to drive every morning. The operation was named [[Operación Ogro]] and it was highly celebrated especially in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and in the dissident areas of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Julen Agirre, translated by Barbara Probst Solomon (1975). Operation Ogro: The Execution of Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carlos Arias Navarro]] took over as [[President of the Spanish Government]], and tried to introduce some reforms to the decaying regime, but he struggled between the two factions of the regime, the conservative ''[[búnker]]'' and the ''aperturistas'', who promoted transition towards democracy.

But there was no way back to the old regime: Spain was not the same as in post-Civil War times and the model for the now wealthy Spaniards was the prosperous Western Europe, not the impoverished post-war Falangist Spain. Additionally, a considerable number of Spanish men had worked in [[Western Europe]] in the previous years as cheap labour forces, thereby encountering the economic growth and wealth of other western Europeans.

Meanwhile, in [[Western Sahara]] the situation became increasingly difficult, with the [[Polisario Front]] fighting for the independence against colonial troops in one hand, and the Moroccan regime wishing to annex the territory to [[Morocco]].

Led by [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Vicente Enrique y Tarancón|Tarancón]] and hand in hand with the reforms of the [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican Council II]], the Spanish [[Roman Catholic]] church had changed deeply by the last years of the Franco regime and could not be counted as supporting it anymore.

In July 1974 Franco fell ill, and [[Juan Carlos]] took over as Head of State. Franco soon recovered, but one year later he fell ill once again, and by late October 1975, he fell into a coma and was put on life support. After a long illness, Franco died on November 20, 1975, at the age of 82—the same date as the death of [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]], founder of the [[Falange]]. It is suspected that his doctors were ordered to keep him barely alive by artificial means until this symbolic date of the far-right.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The historian [[Ricardo de la Cierva]] says that on the 19th around 6 p.m. he was told that Franco had already died. After Franco's death, the interim government decided to bury him at [[Valle de los Caídos]], a colossal memorial to all the casualties of the [[Spanish Civil War]], although it was conceived by Franco and has a distinctly nationalist tone.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Upon Franco's death, Juan Carlos became the King of Spain and immediately used his absolute power to transition to a democratic and constitutional monarchy. The Spanish State ceased to exist in 1975 ''de facto'' during the [[Spanish transition to democracy]], and was officially over ''de jure'' after the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]].

==Government==
After Franco's victory in 1939, the FET y de las JONS (formed in 1937 by the FE de las JONS, the [[Carlists]], and several conservative groups) was declared the sole legal party in Spain, and asserted itself as the main component of the ''[[Movimiento Nacional]]''. In a [[state of emergency]]-like status, the 100 member [[central committee|national council]] (central committee) of the FET worked as makeshift legislature of Spain until the passing of the [[Organic law|Organic law of 1942]] (''Ley Organica'') and the Constituting of the Cortes Act (''Ley Constitutiva de las Cortes'') the same year, which saw the grand reopening of the [[Cortes Generales]] on July 18, 1942.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e02yoA0vFwI&amp;feature=related&lt;/ref&gt;

The Organic law stipulated the government to be ultimately responsible for all legislation of the country,&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies.us&quot;&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/spain/22.htm Spain - The Franco Years&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; while defining the Cortes of Spain as a purely advisory body elected by neither direct or universal suffrage. As all ministers were appointed on the grace of Franco as the &quot;Chief&quot; of state and government, he was monopolized as the one source of legislation. The law of national referendums (''Ley del Referendum Nacional''), passed in 1945 approved for all &quot;fundamental law&quot; to be approved by a popular referendum, in which only the family heads could vote. Local [[municipal council]]s were appointed similarly by family heads and local [[corporatism|corporations]] through elections, while the government exercised the exclusive right to appoint mayors. It was thus one of the most centralized countries in Europe, and certainly the most centralized in Western Europe following the fall of Portuguese dictator [[Marcelo Caetano]] in the [[Carnation Revolution]].

The law of referendums was exercised twice; in 1947, when a law [[Law of succession referendum, 1947|approved through a referendum]] revived the Spanish [[monarchy]] with Franco as interim regent [[president for life|for life]] with sole right to appoint his successor, secondly in 1966, [[Spanish organic law referendum, 1966|to approve of a new &quot;organic law&quot;]], or [[constitution]], supposedly limiting and clearly defining Franco's powers as well as formally creating the modern office of [[Prime Minister of Spain|President of the Government of Spain]]. By delaying the issue of republic versus monarchy for his 36-year dictatorship, and by refusing to take up the throne himself in 1947, Franco sought to antagonize neither the monarchical Carlists (who preferred the restoration of a Bourbon), nor the republican &quot;old shirts&quot;, i.e. the original Falangists. In 1961, Franco offered [[Otto von Habsburg]] the throne, but was refused, and ultimately followed Otto's recommendation by selecting the young [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos of Bourbon]] in 1969, shortly after his 30th birthday (the minimum age required under the Law of Succession).

==Colonial empire and decolonization==
{{See|Spanish Empire}}
Spain attempted to retain control the last remnants of its colonial empire throughout Franco's rule. During the [[Algerian War]] (1954–62), Madrid became the base of the ''[[Organisation de l'armée secrète]]'' (OAS) right-wing French Army group which sought to preserve [[French rule in Algeria|French Algeria]]. Despite this, Franco was forced to make some concessions. Henceforth, when [[French Morocco]] became independent in 1956, he surrendered [[Spanish Morocco]] to [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Mohammed V]], retaining only a few enclaves (the ''[[Plazas de soberanía]]''). The year after, Mohammed V invaded [[Spanish Sahara]] during the [[Ifni War]] (known as the &quot;Forgotten War&quot; in Spain). Only in 1975, with the [[Green March]] and the military occupation, did Morocco take control of all of the former Spanish territories in the Sahara.

In 1968, under United Nations pressure, Franco granted Spain's colony of [[Equatorial Guinea]] its independence, and the next year, ceded the [[exclave]] of [[Ifni]] to [[Morocco]]. Under Franco, Spain also pursued a campaign to gain sovereignty of the [[British overseas territory]] of [[Gibraltar]], and [[Disputed status of Gibraltar|closed its border with Gibraltar]] in 1969. The border would not be fully reopened until 1985.

==Francoism==
[[File:Franco0001.PNG|thumb|200px|Franco in 1969.]]
{{Falangism sidebar}}
The consistent points in Francoism included above all [[authoritarianism]], [[nationalism]] and anti-[[Anticlericalism and Freemasonry|Freemasonry]]; some authors also quote [[integralism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FBVCgetqZAAC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=franco+integralism&amp;source=web&amp;ots=kxe52hpW6n&amp;sig=5jM6bkwiTRB035W8R4ZuA4d5ByE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result Fundamentalism in comparative ... - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; All in all, Francoism showed a frontal rejection of [[Communism]], [[Socialism]] and [[Anarchism]]. Although Franco and Spain under his rule adopted some trappings of fascism, he, and Spain under his rule, are not generally considered to be fascist by scholars of fascism; among the distinctions, fascism entails a revolutionary aim to transform society, where Franco and Franco's Spain did not seek to do so, and, to the contrary, although authoritarian, were conservative and traditional.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franco and the Spanish Civil War&quot;&gt;De Menses, Filipe Ribeiro [http://books.google.com/books?id=InPG_1wKfCIC&amp;dq Franco and the Spanish Civil War], p. 87, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;Gilmour, David, [http://books.google.com/books?id=O-SEAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=&amp;pgis=1 The Transformation of Spain: From Franco to the Constitutional Monarchy], p. 7 1985 Quartet Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Payne, Stanley [http://books.google.com/books?id=NiD3UeOCSGsC&amp;dq Fascism in Spain, 1923–1977], p. 476 1999 Univ. of Wisconsin Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fascism in Spain, 1923–1977&quot;&gt;Payne, Stanley [http://books.google.com/books?id=NiD3UeOCSGsC&amp;dq Fascism in Spain, 1923–1977], p. 347, 476 1999 Univ. of Wisconsin Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fascism: Past, Present, Future&quot;/&gt;

[[Stanley Payne]], the preeminent scholar on fascism and Spain notes: &quot;scarcely any of the serious historians and analysts of Franco consider the generalissimo to be a core fascist.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter [http://books.google.com/books?id=fWggQTqioXcC&amp;dq Fascism: Past, Present, Future], p. 13, 1997 Oxford University Press US&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Walter Laqueur]] &quot;during the civil war, Spanish fascists were forced to subordinate their activities to the nationalist cause. At the helm were military leaders such as General Francisco Franco, who were conservatives in all essential respects. When the civil war ended, Franco was so deeply entrenched that the Falange stood no chance; in this strongly authoritarian  regime, there was no room for political opposition. The fascists became junior partners in the government and, as such, they had to accept responsibility for the regime's policy without being able to shape it substantially&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?hl=es&amp;id=fWggQTqioXcC&amp;q=spanish+fascism#v=snippet&amp;q=spanish%20fascism&amp;f=false Fascism: Past, Present, Future - Google Libros&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
Unlike [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]] (founder of the Falange and executed by the Republicans during the course of the war) Franco lacked any consistent political ideology other than fierce anti-communism.

Franco initially sought support from various groups, such as [[National syndicalism]] (''nacionalsindicalismo'') and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (''[[nacionalcatolicismo]]''). The [[Falange]], a fringe fascist inspired party during the Republic, soon transformed itself into the frame of reference{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} in the ''Movimiento Nacional''. In April 1937, the ''[[Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista]]'' (&quot;Spanish Traditionalist Phalanx of the Assemblies of National-Syndicalist Offensive&quot;, FET y de las JONS) was created from a merger of the [[Carlism|Carlist traditionalists]] with the ''[[Falange Española de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista]]'', which itself was issued of a merger of [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]]'s ''[[Falange Española]]'' with the national-syndicalist ''[[Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista]]'' (JONS).

===Authoritarianism===
Unlike other ideological-based regimes' parties, such as the Italian [[National Fascist Party]] and the German [[Nazi Party]], the FET-JONS were relatively heterogeneous instead of being an ideological monolith. Because of this, the Spanish State is generally considered to be authoritarian rather than fascist; among the distinctions, fascism entails a revolutionary aim to transform society, where Franco did not seek to do so, and, to the contrary, although authoritarian, were conservative and traditional.
&lt;ref name=&quot;Franco and the Spanish Civil War&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fascism in Spain, 1923–1977&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fascism: Past, Present, Future&quot;&gt;Laqueur, Walter [http://books.google.com/books?id=fWggQTqioXcC&amp;dq Fascism: Past, Present, Future] p. 13 1996 Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, the Falange opposed freer capital markets, but the ultimately prevailing [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]], many of whom were linked with [[Opus Dei]], eschewed syndicalist economics and favoured increased competition as a means of achieving rapid economic growth and integration with wider Europe which meant greater democracy.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Franco Years: Policies, Programs, and Growing Popular Unrest.&quot; ''A Country Study: Spain'' &lt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html#es0034&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

While it included fascist trappings, the Spanish State was very authoritarian: non-government [[trade union]]s and all political opponents across the [[political spectrum]] were either suppressed or tightly controlled by all means, including violent police repression. Most country towns and rural areas were patrolled by pairs of ''[[Guardia Civil (Spain)|Guardia Civil]]'', a military police for civilians, which functioned as his chief means of social control. Larger cities, and capitals, were mostly under the heavily-armed ''[[Cuerpo Nacional de Policía (Spain)|Policía Armada]]'', commonly called ''grises''.

Members of the oppressed ranged from trade unions to [[communism|communist]] and [[anarchism|anarchist]] organisations to [[liberal democracy|liberal democrats]] and [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan]] or [[Basque nationalism|Basque]] separatists. The ''[[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]]'' (CNT) and the ''[[Unión General de Trabajadores]]'' (UGT) trade-unions were outlawed, and replaced in 1940 by the corporatist ''[[Sindicato Vertical]]''. The [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) party and the ''[[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya]]'' (ERC) were banned in 1939, while the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] (PCE) went underground. University students seeking democracy revolted in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which was repressed by the ''grises''. The [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV) went into exile, and in 1959, the [[ETA]] armed group was created to wage a [[low-intensity warfare|low-intensity war]] against Franco. Franco, like others at the time{{Who|date=July 2007}}, evinced a concern about a possible [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] conspiracy against his regime. Some non-Spanish authors{{Who|date=July 2007}} have described it as being an &quot;obsession&quot;{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}.

Franco continued to personally sign all death warrants until just months before he died despite international campaigns requesting him to desist.

===Nationalism===
Franco's Spanish nationalism promoted a unitary national identity by repressing Spain's cultural diversity. [[Bullfighting]] and [[flamenco]]&lt;ref&gt;Roman, Mar. &quot;Spain frets over future of flamenco.&quot; 27 October 2007. Associated Press. [http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071027/ap_en_mu/flamenco_for_foreigners]&lt;/ref&gt; were promoted as national traditions while those traditions not considered &quot;Spanish&quot; were suppressed. Franco's view of Spanish tradition was somewhat artificial and arbitrary: while some regional traditions were suppressed, Flamenco, an [[Andalusia]]n tradition, was considered part of a larger, national identity. All cultural activities were subject to [[censorship]], and many were plainly forbidden (often in an erratic manner). This cultural policy relaxed with time, most notably in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Franco was reluctant to enact any form of administrative and legislative decentralisation and kept a fully centralised form of government with a similar administrative structure to that established by the [[House of Bourbon]] and General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera y Orbaneja]]. Such structures were both based in the model of the French centralised State. The main drawback of this kind of management is that government attention and initiatives were irregular, and often depended on the goodwill of regional Government representatives than on regional needs. Thus, inequalities in schooling, health care or transport facilities among regions were patent: classically affluent regions like Madrid, Catalonia, or the Basque Country fared much better than Extremadura, Galicia or Andalusia. Some regions, like Extremadura or La Mancha didn't have a university.

Franco dissolved the autonomy granted by the [[Second Spanish Republic]] to these two regions and to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. Franco abolished the centuries-old fiscal privileges and autonomy (the ''[[fueros]]'') in two of the three Basque provinces: [[Guipuzcoa]] and [[Biscay]], but kept them for [[Alava]]. Among Franco's greatest area of support during the civil war was [[Navarre]], also a Basque speaking region in its north half. Navarre remained a separated region from the Basque Country and Franco decided to preserve its also centuries' old fiscal privileges and autonomy, the so-called [[Fueros of Navarre]].

Franco also used [[Language politics in Spain under Franco|language politics]] in an attempt to establish national homogeneity. Despite Franco being Galician, in accordance with his nationalist principles, he abolished the official statute and recognition for the [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Galician language|Galician]], and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] languages that the [[Second Spanish Republic]] had granted for the first time in the history of Spain. He returned to [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as the only official language of the State and education, although millions of the country's citizens spoke other languages. The legal usage of languages other than Spanish was forbidden. All government, notarial, legal and commercial documents were to be drawn up exclusively in Spanish and any written in other languages were deemed null and void. The usage of any other language was forbidden in schools, in advertising, and on road and shop signs. Publications in other languages were generally forbidden, though citizens continued to speak other languages in private.

This was the situation throughout the 1940s and, to a lesser extent, during the 1950s, but after 1960 the non-Castilian Spanish languages were freely spoken and written and reached books, plays, and films. Even so, non-Castilian languages continued to be discouraged and never received official status: all government, notarial, legal and commercial documents were still drawn up exclusively in Spanish and any written in other languages were deemed null and void.

Additionally, the popularisation of the compulsory national educational system and the development of modern mass media, both controlled by the State and in Spanish language, and heavily reduced the number of speakers of Basque, Catalan and Galician, as happened during the second half of the 20th century with other European minority languages which were not officially protected like [[Scottish Gaelic]] or French [[Breton language|Breton]]. By the 1970s, the majority of the population in the urban areas could not speak in the [[minority language]] or, as in some Catalan towns, their use had been abandoned. The most endangered case was the Basque language. By the 1970s Basque had reached the point where any further reduction in the number of Basque speakers would have not guaranteed the necessary generational renewal and it is now recognised that the language would have disappeared in only a few more decades. This was the main reason that drove the Francoist provincial government of [[Alava]] to create a network of Basque medium schools ([[Ikastola]]) in 1973 which were State financed.

===Conservatism===
[[Catholicism]] was made the official religion of the Spanish State, which enforced Catholic social [[mores]]. The [[Catholic Church]] was established as the one religion of the Spanish State. The remaining nomads of Spain ([[Gitano]]s and [[Merchero]]s like [[Eleuterio Sánchez|El Lute]]) were especially affected. The Spanish State enforced Catholic behavior mainly by using a law (the ''Ley de Vagos y Maleantes'', Vagrancy Act) enacted by [[Manuel Azaña|Azaña]].&lt;ref&gt;http://search.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/tifs.php?coleccion=gazeta&amp;anyo=1933&amp;nbo=217&amp;lim=A&amp;pub=BOE&amp;pco=874&amp;pfi=877&lt;/ref&gt; Civil servants had to be Catholic, and some official jobs even required a &quot;good behavior&quot; statement by a priest. Civil marriages which had taken place under Republican Spain were declared null and void and had to be convalidated by the [[Catholic Church]] of Spain. Civil marriages were only possible after the couple made a public renunciation to the Catholic Church. Divorce, contraceptives and abortion were forbidden. From 1954 onwards, [[homosexuality]], [[pedophilia]], and [[prostitution]] were criminal offenses,&lt;ref&gt;http://search.boe.es/datos/imagenes/BOE/1954/198/A04862.tif&lt;/ref&gt; although the enforcement of this was seldom consistent.

Francoism professed a devotion to the traditional role of women in society, that is: loving child to her parents and brothers, faithful to her husband, residing with her family. Official propaganda confined her role to family care and motherhood. Most progressive laws passed by the Republic were made void, correspondingly. Women could not become judges, or testify in trial.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} They could not become university professors.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  In the 1960s and 1970s the situation became increasingly liberalized, finally reaching full liberalization after Franco's death.

Although a self-proclaimed monarchist, Franco had no particular desire for a king, due to his strained relations with the legitimate heir of the Crown, [[Don Juan de Borbón]]. Therefore, he left the throne vacant, with himself as de facto [[regent]]. In 1947 Franco proclaimed Spain a [[monarchy]], through the ''Ley de Sucesión en la Jefatura del Estado'' act, but did not designate a monarch.  Instead, he set the basis for his succession. This gesture was largely done to appease monarchist factions within the Movimiento. He wore the uniform of a captain general (a rank traditionally reserved for the King), resided in the royal [[Pardo Palace]], appropriated the kingly privilege of walking beneath a [[baldachin|canopy]], and his portrait appeared on most Spanish coins. Indeed, although his formal titles were Jefe del Estado (Head of State) and ''Generalísimo de los Ejércitos Españoles'' ([[Generalissimo]] of the Spanish Armed Forces), he was referred to as ''Caudillo de España por la gracia de Dios,'' ([[by the Grace of God]], the Leader of Spain). ''Por la Gracia de Dios'' is a technical, legal formulation which states sovereign dignity in [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]], and had only been used by monarchs before Franco used it himself. The long-delayed selection of Juan Carlos de Borbón as Franco's official successor in 1969 was an unpleasant surprise for many interested parties, as Juan Carlos was the rightful heir for neither the Carlists nor the Legitimists{{Citation needed|reason=21-9-2009|date=September 2009}}.

== Economic policy ==
{{See also|Economic history of Spain#The Franco Era.2C 1939-75|l1=Economic history of Spain: Economy under Franco}}
[[File:Spanish peseta coin with Franco 1963.gif|thumb|left|200px|1963 [[Spanish peseta]] coin with the image of Franco, saying ''Caudillo de España, por la gracia de Dios'' (''Francisco Franco, Leader of Spain, by the grace of God'').]]
The Civil War had ravaged the Spanish economy.  Infrastructure had been damaged, workers killed, and daily business severely hampered.  For more than a decade after Franco's victory, the economy improved little. Franco initially pursued a policy of [[autarky]], cutting off almost all international trade.  The policy had devastating effects, and the economy stagnated. Only black marketeers could enjoy an evident affluence.

In 1940, the [[Sindicato Vertical|&quot;Vertical Trade Union&quot;]] was created; it was inspired by the ideas of [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}, who thought that [[class struggle]] would be ended by grouping together workers and owners according to [[corporate state|corporative]] principles. It was the only legal trade union, and was under government control. Other trade unions were forbidden and strongly repressed along with political parties outside the FET-JONS.

On one occasion, a Czech engineer and con-man managed to convince the general that with the waters of the River Jarama and certain herbs and secret powders, Spain could get all the petroleum it needed. On another, he was convinced of a plan to solve the country’s terrible hunger of the 1940s by feeding the population of 30 million with dolphin sandwiches. (La Memoria Insumisa, Nicolás Sartorius y Javier Alfaya, 1999). Indeed in the background of these economic policies some 200,000 people died of hunger{{Dubious|date=July 2009}} in the early years of Francoism, a period known as ''Los Años de Hambre'' (the Years of Hunger).

On the brink of bankruptcy, a combination of pressure from the USA, the IMF and technocrats from Opus Dei managed to “convince” the regime to adopt a free market economy in 1959 in what amounted to a mini coup d’etat which removed the old guard in charge of the economy, despite the opposition of Franco. This economic liberalisation was not, however, accompanied by political reforms and repression continued unabated, though these very reforms would lead to socio-economic changes in Spanish society which would make the regime’s continuation 16 years later untenable.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Economic growth picked up after 1959 after Franco took authority away from these ideologues and gave more power to the [[Economic liberalism|liberal]] technocrats.  The country implemented several development policies and growth took off creating the &quot;[[Spanish Miracle]]&quot;. Concurrent with the absence of social reforms, and the economic power shift, a tide of mass emigration commenced: to European countries, and to lesser extent, to South America. Emigration helped the Régime in two ways:  the country got rid of surplus population, and the emigrants supplied the country with much needed monetary remittances.

During the 1960s, the population, mainly the wealthier segments, experienced further increases in wealth, particularly those who remained politically faithful. International firms established their factories in Spain: salaries were low, taxes nearly non existent, strikes were forbidden, labour health or real state regulations were unheard of, and Spain was virtually a virgin market. Spain became the second-fastest growing economy in the world, just behind [[Japan]]). The rapid development of this period became known as the Spanish Miracle. At the time of Franco's death, Spain still lagged behind most of Western Europe, but the gap between its GDP per capita and that of the major Western European economies had greatly narrowed; in world terms, Spain was already enjoying a fairly high material standard of living with basic but comprehensive services. However, the period between the mid 1970s and mid 1980s was to prove difficult as, in addition to the [[oil shocks]] to which Spain was highly exposed, the settling of the new political order took priority over the modernising of the economy.

== Legacy ==
[[File:Santa Cruz del Valle de los Caídos.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Franco is entombed in the monument of [[Valle de los Caídos|Santa Cruz del Valle de los Caídos]].]]
[[File:Francoayto.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Equestrian statue of ''Generalissimo'' Franco in the ''Plaza del Ayuntamiento'' (City Hall Plaza) of [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]]. It was retired in late 2008.]]
In Spain and abroad, the legacy of Franco remains controversial. In Germany a squadron named after [[Werner Mölders]] has been renamed, because as a pilot he led the escorting units in the [[bombing of Guernica]]. As recently as 2006, the BBC reported that [[Maciej Giertych]], an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] of the right-wing [[League of Polish Families]], had expressed admiration for Franco's stature who allegedly &quot;guaranteed the maintenance of traditional values in Europe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5151504.stm Europe diary: Franco and Finland], [[BBC News]], 6 July 2006 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But this is not the most shared opinion. Several statues of Franco and other public Francoist symbols have been removed, with the last statue in Madrid coming down in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4357373.stm Madrid removes last Franco statue], [[BBC News]], 17 March 2005 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Permanent Commission of the [[European Parliament]] &quot;firmly&quot; condemned in a resolution unanimously adopted in March 2006 the &quot;multiple and serious violations&quot; of [[human rights]] committed in Spain under the Francoist regime from 1939 to 1975.&lt;ref name=EP&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/03/17/espana/1142617936.html Primera condena al régimen de Franco en un recinto internacional], [[EFE]], ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'', 17 March 2006 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Martyna Czarnowska, [http://www.wienerzeitung.at/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabID=4399&amp;Alias=Dossiers&amp;cob=189475&amp;DosCob=164869 Almunia, Joaquin: EU-Kommission (4): Ein halbes Jahr Vorsprung], ''Weiner Zeitung'', 17 February 2005 (article in German language). Accessed 26 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution was at the initiative of the MEP Leo Brincat and of the historian Luis María de Puig, and is the first international official condemnation of the repression enacted by Franco's regime.&lt;ref name=EP/&gt; The resolution also urged to provide public access to historians (professional and amateurs) to the various [[archive]]s of the Francoist regime, including those of the ''Fundación Francisco Franco'' which, as well as other Francoist archives, remain as of 2006 inaccessible to the public.&lt;ref name=EP/&gt; Furthermore, it urged the Spanish authorities to set up an underground [[art exhibition|exhibition]] in the [[Valle de los Caídos]] monument, in order to explain the &quot;terrible&quot; conditions in which it was built.&lt;ref name=EP/&gt; Finally, it proposes the construction of monuments to commemorate Franco's victims in Madrid and other important cities.&lt;ref name=EP/&gt;

In Spain, a commission to repair the dignity and restitute the memory of the victims of Francoism (''Comisión para reparar la dignidad y restituir la memoria de las víctimas del franquismo'') was approved in the summer of 2004, and is directed by the vice-president [[María Teresa Fernández de la Vega]].&lt;ref name=EP/&gt;

The late Franco was a prominent and frequent subject of jokes on early episodes of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', see &quot;[[Generalissimo Francisco Franco is still dead]]&quot;.

Because of his language policies, Franco's legacy is still particularly poorly perceived in [[Catalonia]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]. The Basque Country and Catalonia were among the regions that offered the strongest resistance to Franco in the Civil War, as well as during his regime.

Recently the [[Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory]] (ARHM) initiated a systematic search for mass graves of people executed during Franco's regime, which has been supported since the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]]'s victory during the [[Spanish general election, 2004|2004 elections]] by [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]]'s government. A ''Ley de la memoria histórica de España'' (Law on the Historical Memory of Spain) was passed in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12304721 |title=Bones of Contention |accessdate=2008-10-06 |date=2008-09-27 |work=The Economist |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5bLyvad0B |archivedate=2008-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law is supposed to enforce an official recognition of the crimes committed against civilians during the Francoist rule and organize under state supervision the search for mass graves.

== Flags and heraldry ==
=== Flags ===
At the conclusion of the Spanish Civil War, and in spite of the army's reorganisation, several sections of the army continued with their bi-colour flags improvised in 1936, but since 1940 new ensigns began to be distributed, whose main innovation was the addition of the [[eagle (heraldry)|eagle]] of [[John the Evangelist]] to the shield. The new arms were allegedly inspired in the coat of arms the [[Catholic Monarchs]] adopted after the taking of [[Granada]] from the [[Moors]], but replacing the arms of [[Sicily]] with those of [[Navarre]] and adding the [[Pillars of Hercules]] on either side of the coat of arms. In 1938 the columns were placed outside the wings. On July 26, 1945 the commander's ensigns were suppressed by decree, and on October 11, a detailed regulation of flags was published that fixed the model of the bi-colour flag in use, but better defined its details, emphasising a greater{{clarify|date=September 2011}} style of the Saint John's eagle. The models established by this decree remained in force until 1977.

During this period two more flags were usually displayed along with the national flag: the flag of [[Falange|Spanish Falange]] (three vertical strips, red, black and red, with the black stripe wider than the red, and the ''[[yoke]] and arrows'' emblem in red in the centre of the black stripe) and the [[Carlist]] flag (the Saint Andrew [[saltire]] or [[Cross of Burgundy Flag|Cross of Burgundy]] red on white), representing the [[Movimiento Nacional|National Movement]] which had unified Falange and the [[Requetés]] under the name ''Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS''.

From the death of Franco in 1975 until 1977, the national flag followed the 1945 regulations. On 21 January 1977 a new regulation was approved that stipulated an eagle with more open wings, (&quot;pasmada&quot; eagle), with the restored Pillars of Hercules placed within the wings, and the tape with the motto UNA, GRANDE Y LIBRE (ONE, GREAT and FREE) moved over the eagle's head from its previous position around the neck.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Standards===
From 1940 to 1975, Franco used the Castilian Bend (like the version of Charles I) as Head of State’s Standard and [[Colours, standards and guidons|Guidon]]: The Bend between the Pillars of Hercules, crowned with an imperial crown and open (old) royal crown.

Juan Carlos I, as Prince of Spain from 1969 to 1975, used a royal standard which was virtually identical to the one later adopted when he was became King in 1975. The earlier standard differed only that it featured the royal crown of a Crown Prince, the King's royal crown has 8 arches of which 5 are visible, while the Prince's one has only 4 arches of which 3 are visible. The Royal Standard of Spain consists of a dark blue square with the Coat of arms of the King in the center. The King's Guidon is identical to the standard, differing it in that it incorporates a fringe.

File:Estandarte del infante Juan Carlos de Borbón como Príncipe de España.svg|[[Royal Standard of Spain|Standard Juan Carlos I, as Prince of Spain]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Coat of arms===
In 1938, Franco adopted a variant of the Coat of Arms reinstating some elements originally used by the [[House of Trastámara]] such as Saint John's eagle and the yoke and bundle, as follows: Quarterly, 1 and 4. quarterly Castile and León, 2 and 3. per pale Aragon and Navarra, enté en point of Granada. The arms are crowned with an open royal crown, placed on eagle displayed sable, surrounded with the pillars of Hercules, the yoke and the bundle of arrows of the Catholic Monarchs.

'''Joaquín Almunia Amann''' (born 17 June 1948) is a [[politics of Spain|Spanish politician]] and prominent member of the [[European Commission]], currently responsible for Competition under the second mandate of President Barroso. He was previously responsible for Economic and Monetary Affairs in Barroso's previous mandate. The president of the Commission, [[José Manuel Barroso]], had announced on 27 November 2009 that Almunia would be a Vice-President and the responsible for [[European Commissioner for Competition|Competition]] in the second college of the [[Barroso Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.net/2009/11/27/barroso-names-new-eu-commission-team/ Barroso names new EU commission team. Euronews]. Retrieved 27 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Bilbao]], he is married and has two children. He graduated in Law and Economics at the [[University of Deusto]], and completed follow-up studies at the [[École Pratique des Hautes Études]] in Paris and the “Senior managers in Government” program at the [[Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]]. He was an associate lecturer on Employment and Social Security Law at the [[University of Alcalá de Henares]].

Almunia was chief economist of the [[Unión General de Trabajadores]], the Spanish [[trade union]] affiliated to the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE), from 1976 to 1979. He was economist at the Council Bureau of the Spanish Chambers of Commerce in [[Brussels]] from 1972 to 1975.

Almunia was a PSOE Member of the [[Cortes Generales]] from [[Spanish general election, 1979|1979]] to 2004, representing [[Madrid (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Madrid]]. He was Minister of Employment and Social Security from 1982 to 1986 and Minister of Public Administration from 1986 to 1991, and was PSOE spokesperson from 1994 to 1997. Upon the resignation of [[Felipe González]] after being defeated in the [[Spanish general election, 1996|1996 elections]], Almunia became the party leader from 1997 to 2000. In [[Spanish general election, 2000|2000]], he was the PSOE candidate for [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]], and the party was again defeated by incumbent Prime Minister, [[José María Aznar]]. The PSOE suffered its worst result in a General Election since the [[Spanish transition to democracy|Transition]] times and Almunia resigned as party leader.

Almunia was director of the research program on ''Equality and redistribution of income'' at the [[Fundación Argentaria]] from 1991 to 1994. In 2002, he founded and was director of the progressive think tank ''[[Laboratorio de Alternativas]]''.

He first joined the Prodi Commission on 26 April 2004 as a successor to [[Pedro Solbes]] (who had resigned to join the new [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero|Zapatero Government]]) and was re-appointed by Barroso in November 2004.

[[Don (honorific)|Don]] '''José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero''' ({{IPA-es|xoseˈlwiz roˈðɾiɣeθ θapaˈteɾo|-|Es-zapatero.ogg}};&lt;ref&gt;In ''Diccionario panhispánico de dudas'', [http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/SrvltGUIBusDPD?lema=acento#11b acento], it is said explicitly that José Luis is pronounced [joseluís], i.e. [[IPA]] [xose'lwis] or [xose'lwiz]. The provided audio file confirms this.&lt;/ref&gt; born 4 August 1960) is a member of the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE). He was elected for two terms as [[Prime Minister of Spain]], in the [[Spanish legislative election, 2004|2004]] and [[Spanish legislative election, 2008|2008]] general elections. On 2 April 2011 he announced he would not stand for re-election in the [[Spanish general election, 2011|2011 general election]]. After the crushing defeat his party suffered in the elections, he left office on 21 December 2011.

Among the main actions taken by the Zapatero administration, were [[Multi-National Force - Iraq#2004 withdrawals|the withdrawal of Spanish troops from the Iraq war]], which allegedly resulted in long term diplomatic tensions with the [[George W. Bush administration]]; the increase of Spanish troops in [[Afghanistan]]; the idea of an [[Alliance of Civilizations]], co-sponsored by Turkish Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]; the legalisation of [[same-sex marriage]]; reform of abortion law; a controversial attempt at [[ETA's 2006 &quot;permanent ceasefire&quot;|peace negotiation]] with [[ETA]]; the increase of [[tobacco smoking|tobacco]] restrictions; and the reform of various [[Autonomous Community|Autonomous statutes]], particularly the [[Statute of Catalonia]].

==Personal life==
===Family background===
José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero was born in [[Valladolid]], [[Castile and León]], to Juan Rodríguez y García-Lozano (b. 1928), a [[lawyer]], and María de la Purificación Zapatero y Valero ([[Valladolid]], 1927 – [[Madrid]], 30 October 2000). He grew up in [[León, Spain|León]], where his family originated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His paternal grandfather, Juan Rodríguez y Lozano (28 July 1893 – [[Puente Castro]], [[León (province)|León]], 18 August 1936), was a [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] [[Captain (land and air)|captain]], executed by Franco's National army a month into the [[Spanish Civil War]], for refusing to fight with them.&lt;ref name=&quot;cidob&quot;&gt;[http://www.cidob.org/es/documentacion/biografias_lideres_politicos/europa/espana/jose_luis_rodriguez_zapatero Center for International Relations and Development Studies](text in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; He was betrayed and his whereabouts were revealed by certain PSOE people in Valladolid, before Rodriguez Zapatero was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|es|''Zapatero. Presidente a la Primera''}}. 1st ed. updated. ({{lang|es|La Esfera de los Libros}}, Spain, April 2004). ISBN 84-9734-193-7. p.  54&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, his maternal grandfather supported the coup d'état of Franco. 

His maternal grandfather, Faustino Zapatero y Coronel, was a [[paediatrics|paediatrician]] and [[middle class]] [[Liberalism|liberal]] who died in 1978. His maternal grandmother María de la Natividad Valero y Asensio ([[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]], 9 December 1902 – Valladolid, 28 June 2006) was a [[right-wing]] [[conservative]] and died at age 103.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OCAM|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zapatero was born in Valladolid not only because of his mother's attachment to her family, who lived there, but also because of the medical profession of her father.

Zapatero has said that, as a youngster, &quot;as I remember it, I used to participate in late night conversations with my father and brother about politics, law or literature&quot;. However, he did not get on very well with his father at times. Sources say that his father refused to let him work or take any part in his buffet,{{clarify|date=November 2011}} and this scarred him for life.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{cite OCAM|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says that his family taught him to be tolerant, thoughtful, prudent and austere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page= 294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The memory of Republican Captain Rodríguez y Lozano was also kept alive by his last [[will (law)|will]], handwritten 24 hours before facing the firing squad, and which can be considered a final declaration of principles. The will comprised six parts, the first three bestowing his possessions on his heirs; the fourth, in which he asked for a civil burial and, the fifth, in which he requested his family to forgive those who had tried and executed him and proclaiming his belief in the [[Supreme Being]]. In the sixth, Zapatero's grandfather asked his family to clear his name in the future as his creed consisted only in his &quot;love for peace, for good and for improving the living conditions of the lower classes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages= 51 fol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zapatero is a supporter of [[FC Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/377088531.html?dids=377088531:377088531&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+29%2C+2003&amp;author=Steven+Goff&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=Barça+Isn%27t+Lounging+Around%3B+Storied+Catalonian+Club+Plots+Its+Return+to+the+Top|title=Barça Isn't Lounging Around; Storied Catalonian Club Plots Its Return to the Top|first=Steven|last=Goff|work=The Washington Post | date=29 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nation.ittefaq.com/issues/2008/07/02/news0376.htm|agency=Associated Press|title=Spain's football team welcomed by royals|work=The New Nation|accessdate=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies and teaching===
He studied Law at the [[University of León]], graduating in 1982. His performance as a student was above average before his pre-University year. His grades later in the year and in the University were essentially mediocre. According to his brother Juan: &quot;He didn't study much but it made no difference, he continued successfully&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page= 71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating, Zapatero worked as a teaching assistant in constitutional law at the University of León until 1986 (he continued working some hours a week without pay until 1991). It was subsequently found that he had been appointed by his department without the usual selection process involving interviews and competitive examinations, which if true, constitutes a case of political favouritism.&lt;ref name=&quot;cidob&quot;/&gt; He has declared that the only activity that attracts him besides politics is teaching or, at most, academic research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodríguez Zapatero met [[Sonsoles Espinosa]] in León in 1981. They married on 27 January 1990 and have two daughters named Laura (b. 1993) and Alba (b. 1995).

In October 1991, his contract was cancelled by the new rector of the University of León, Julio César Santoyo, after the University's legal advisers considered Zapatero's posts as a teaching assistant and an MP to be incompatible (he had been elected in 1986). The [[Cortes Generales|Spanish Parliament]]'s counselors, however, had considered the contract valid.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Zapatero did not do the military service which was compulsory in Spain: he received successive deferments because of his conditions as a university student and a teaching assistant. As an [[Member of Parliament|MP]] he was finally exempted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zapatero enters politics===
Zapatero attended his first political rally, organized by the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) in [[Gijón]] in 1976. Some political parties had been legal since 21 July 1976, but the PSOE was not legalized until February 1977. The speech of [[Felipe González]], the PSOE leader and future [[Prime Minister of Spain]], who took part in the rally, exerted an important influence on Zapatero. He said, among other things, that &quot;the Socialists' goal was the seizure of power by the [[working class]] to transform the ownership of the [[means of production]]&quot; and that &quot;the PSOE was a revolutionary party but not ''revolutionarist'' or ''aventurist'' [...], as it defended the use of elections to come to power&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages= 29 fol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zapatero and his family had been traditionally attracted to the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party]] as it was the only party really organized before [[Francisco Franco]]'s death in 1975.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} But, after the famous political rally in Gijón, they, and especially Zapatero, started to believe that the Socialist Party was the most probable future for the Spanish [[political left|left]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p111&quot;&gt;{{cite OCAM| page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the Socialist Party was rebuilding its infrastructure in the province of León after having been outlawed following the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page= 110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the year of the first democratic elections after Franco's death, Zapatero supported both the Communist and Socialist parties. He pasted posters of both parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;p111&quot;/&gt;

He eventually joined the PSOE on 23 February 1979. The impression Felipe González had caused on him in 1976 played a fundamental role in his decision to join the party. In 1979, during the [[Congreso Extraordinario del PSOE (1979)]], the PSOE had renounced [[Marxism]] as its ideological base. He said nothing about joining the party at home, because he was afraid his parents would discourage him, considering him too young to join a political party.

In 1982, Zapatero became head of the socialist youth organization in the province of [[León (province)|León]]. In July 1982, he met Felipe González at the summer school &quot;Jaime Vera&quot; and suggested that he make a &quot;left turn&quot; in the PSOE political program for the General Election of October 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page= 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; González answered advising him to abandon his conservative [leftist] viewpoint.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

In 1986, he was elected to represent the province of León in the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] (Parliament), becoming its youngest member after the election held on 20 June. He was number two on the PSOE list for [[León (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|León]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page= 130}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following elections (those held in 1989, 1993, 1996 and 2000) he was number one on the list. In the elections of 2004 he ran for [[Madrid (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Madrid]] as number one.

Zapatero defined himself as a &quot;left-wing conservative&quot; at the time. He explained that he meant that, for sentimental reasons linked to his family, he came from the left that lost the Spanish Civil War and that what had happened between 1936–1939 (the duration of the war) and 1939–1975 ([[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s regime) had a very important significance for him. He further explained that the Spanish left needed to modernize and that &quot;we are finding it difficult to accept the need for the Socialist Party to change many of its ideological parameters and overcome our own conservatism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page= 141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 he became Secretary General in León after a complex internal fight for power that ended a long period of division. In fact, before the provincial conference held that year, [[Ramón Rubial]], then national president of the PSOE, had asked the party in León to foster unity. Zapatero was elected as Secretary General at that conference, leading to a period of stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s and 1990s, the PSOE consisted of two factions: the ''Guerristas'' (supporters of [[Alfonso Guerra]], former vice-president under Felipe González) and the reformers (led by Felipe González). The first group had a stronger left-wing ideology whereas the second was more pragmatic. The division became wider after the General Election of 1993, the last election won by the PSOE before [[José María Aznar]]'s victory in 1996, when the bad results exacerbated the internal conflicts. Zapatero never formally joined either of those two groups.

In 1993, the Socialist Federation of León (FSL – Federación Socialista de León) suffered an important scandal. Some towns experienced unusually sharp increases in PSOE membership in a very short period of time. When some of the supposed new members were questioned by the press, they stated that they were unaware of their membership and that they did not live in the places where they were being registered by the party. It seems that some opponents of Zapatero in León, perhaps with the support of powerful ''Guerristas'' at the top of the Spanish Socialist Party wanted to increase their influence within it by increasing the number of members in the towns of León favorable to them. Their main aim would have been to take control of the Regional Socialist Section of [[Castilla y León]] in the conference to be held in 1994. Zapatero's support for the then Regional Secretary General, Jesús Quijano transformed him into the enemy of the ''Guerristas'' in the region as the FSL is the most important Provincial Section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=169 fol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1994 two papers, ''[[El País]]'' and ''[[Diario de León]]'', published several articles that suggested irregularities in his appointment as a Professor by the [[University of León]] and in his keeping the job until 1991. The suspicions of political favoritism were favored by his having been directly appointed without a prior selection process open to other candidates. On 20 May 1994, he held a press conference where he rejected these accusations. Zapatero attributed to &quot;ignorance&quot; or &quot;bad faith&quot; the content of the articles and linked them to the internal fight for the job of Secretary General of the Regional Chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=102 fol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, three regional conferences were going to be held: two to elect the representatives of the party in León for the Regional and National Conferences to take place that year, and the 7th Provincial conference where the Secretary General was going to be elected.

Before they began, an agreement between the parties involved was drawn up. The new members who did not confirm they had joined the party voluntarily and who did not live in the areas where they were registered would be expelled from the party. Initially 775, and finally 577, new memberships were canceled out of 1160 suspicious memberships.

When the three conferences were held, the tension was very high and, sometimes it was even necessary to call the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of them were finally won by Zapatero or his supporters.

The National Conference (held after most of the representatives elected in the first León Conference were Zapatero's supporters) was won by the ''reformers'', at that time strongly opposed to the ''Guerristas''. That was positive for Zapatero as the list of bogus party members was revised again. Their number grew from 577 to almost 900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zapatero was finally reelected secretary general with 68 percent of the ballots in the 7th Regional Conference held in July 1994, following the removal of the false memberships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=100 &amp; 192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, new regional and local elections were held. The results were bad for the PSOE in León as they lost four seats in the mayoralty of León and two seats in the regional parliament of Castilla-León. The results were influenced by the bad economic situation and the cases of corruption assailing the party. Zapatero had personally directed the electoral campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, after the General Election, Zapatero kept his seat at the Congress of Deputies. The following year, Zapatero was elected again Secretary General of León and after the national conference held by the party that year he entered the National Executive (the party governing body).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the first and only primaries held within the PSOE took place. There were two candidates: [[Joaquín Almunia]] and [[José Borrell]]. The regional party of León declared itself to be neutral. It seems that, unofficially, its leaders including Zapatero, worked harder in favor of Almunia, who was the representative of the reformers and opposed the ''Guerristas''. Zapatero himself phoned personally (as other leaders did) as many party members as possible to request their votes for Almunia.

On 24 April 1998, Borrell won with 9.6% more votes than Almunia in Spain and 4.6% more in León. It seems that Borrell's image of reform played an important role in his victory. Borrell's attitude towards Zapatero seems to have been a little colder after Zapatero's support for his rival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=210 fol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of two leaders Joaquín Almunia, Secretary General, and Josep Borrell, official candidate, caused problems within the PSOE, used to being directed only by the Secretary General. Finally, two former close associates of Borrell were accused of having been corrupt when they worked for him in the Spanish Government, and he resigned, alleging that he did not want to damage his party with the scandal. Almunia replaced him and ran for the Spanish Premiership in the General Elections held in 2000.

The Association of Parliamentary Journalists awarded to Zapatero the &quot;Diputado Revelación&quot; prize (something like ''Most promising MP of the year'') in December 1999 for his activities as a member of the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]]. From 1996 until 2000, his most conspicuous contributions as an MP were his vigorous opposition to the electrical protocol proposed by the government (initially negative for the important coal sector of León), being the PSOE spokesman in the Commission of Public Administration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; and probably his most important success as an MP: the passing of an amendment to the national budget of 2000 in November 1999 that increased the pensions of the non-professional soldiers who fought for the Republic during the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939. They were made equal to those of the professional military. The initiative was defended by him in the name of the Parliamentary Socialist Group, proponent of the amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appointment as Secretary General of the Socialist Party===
On 12 March 2000, the PSOE had lost its second successive election to José María Aznar's [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]]. Zapatero held his seat, but the Socialist Party obtained only 125 seats, 16 fewer than in 1996. The defeat was especially bitter as the People's Party unexpectedly obtained an absolute majority for the first time and the socialist result was worse than in the previous election. Almunia announced his resignation on the very day the General Election took place.

Zapatero decided to run for the leadership of the Socialist Party in its 35th Conference to be held in June that year. Together with other socialist members, he founded a new faction within the party called ''Nueva Vía'' (New Way) in April 2000, to serve him as a platform to become Secretary General. The name of ''Nueva Vía'' is a mix of [[Tony Blair]]'s ''[[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]]'' (''tercera vía'' in Spanish) and [[Gerhard Schröder]]'s ''[[Neue Mitte]]'' (''new center'' or ''nuevo centro'' in Spanish).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 June 2000 Zapatero officially announced his intention to run for the federal Secretaryship General at an Extraordinary Conference of the Socialist Party of León.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech, he stated what can be considered his declaration of principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# To build a society that would accept all foreigners notwithstanding their color or cultural background.
# To give priority to education and to create good jobs for youngsters.
# To provide parents with more time to spend with their children and in taking care of their elders.
# To promote culture and its creators, making it possible for them to grab the spotlight from those aiming only at economic interests.
# To convert Spain into a country admired for helping those with more needs.
# To force the government to help those with initiative and enterprising qualities.
# To foster democracy, to lend distinction to politics and to promote values over temporary interests.

[[Pasqual Maragall]] was the only regional leader of the Socialist Party who officially supported him before the Conference was held. José Borrell also decided to support him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zapatero ran against three other opponents ([[José Bono]], [[Rosa Díez]] and [[Matilde Fernández]]). Matilde Fernández was the candidate of the ''guerristas'' while José Bono was the candidate of the ''reformers''. Rosa Díez is a Basque politician who was a kind of intermediate option.

Zapatero was a ''dark horse'' who had against him his inexperience and in favour his image of reform and being the only MP among the candidates. (All the Spanish opposition leaders had been MPs before winning the elections. A very important factor in Spanish politics where electoral campaigns last for only 15 days and to be widely known long before they begin is essential.) Bono was deeply disliked by the ''guerristas'', who also favoured Zapatero.

Zapatero finally won by a relatively small margin (he obtained 414 votes out of 995 and José Bono obtained 405) on 22 July 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/noticias/2000/7/23/espana/964312046.html XXXV CONGRESO: José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, nuevo secretario general del PSOE]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The margin was relatively small because Bono had no likelihood of winning since the supporters of the other two candidates preferred Zapatero as their second choice. Zapatero accepted the cancellation of a run-off between himself and Bono because he was sure of his victory after only one ballot and he apparently did not want to humiliate his adversary.

After being elected Secretary General, he was congratulated by [[Lionel Jospin]] (then the [[Prime Minister of France]]), [[Gerhard Schröder]] ([[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor of Germany]]) and José María Aznar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to [[Madrid]] with his family that year. As a Congressman he had lived from Monday to Thursday in Madrid and the rest of the time in León.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition leader==
This was the period when Zapatero was appointed as Secretary General  of the PSOE in 2000 until he became [[Prime Minister of Spain]] on 14 March 2004.

===Style of opposition===
Zapatero has always claimed to base his political activity on his love of dialogue. When he was an opposition leader, he liked to contrast his behaviour with the &quot;arrogant&quot;, &quot;[[authoritarianism|authoritarian]]&quot; approach of the People's Party and, especially, that of its leader José María Aznar.

As a result, after being appointed Secretary General, he coined the term ''Calm Opposition'' (''{{lang|es|Oposición Tranquila}}'') to refer to his opposition strategy. The ''Calm Opposition'' was supposedly based on an &quot;open to dialogue&quot;, &quot;soft&quot;, &quot;constructive&quot; attitude (''talante constructivo'', coined as ''talante'') aimed not at damaging the government but at achieving the &quot;best&quot; for the people. (Zapatero has insisted on this point so many times that the term ''talante'' has become very popular in Spain.) Because of this supposed tactic, Zapatero received nicknames like &quot;[[Bambi]]&quot; or &quot;Sosoman&quot; (where &quot;Soso&quot;—meaning dull, insipid, bore—replaces &quot;Super&quot; in &quot;[[Superman]]&quot;), especially in the first months after being appointed General Secretary.

During Zapatero's years as an opposition leader (and later as Prime Minister), the tension between left-wing and right-wing supporters increased and, according to some opinions, a real radicalization of the society took (and is taking) place {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}. Zapatero's supporters blame his opponents for that and the People's Party blames him stating facts such as the increase in the acts of violence committed against them, especially in the months before and during the [[war in Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertaddigital.com/php3/noticia.php3?cpn=1275756079 Libertad Digital: Nacional :: Triple ataque con cócteles molotov contra dos sedes del PP en Galicia y una oficina de la Xunta]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a new term has become popular: ''guerracivilismo''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.es/search?q=guerracivilismo |title=guerracivilismo – Buscar con Google |publisher=Google.es |date=2010-05-15 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (made up of a combination of the Spanish for Civil War and the -ismo [[suffix]], equivalent to the [[English language|English]] -ism), which would refer to the growing enmity of right and left-wing factions.

===2000 and 2001===
Zapatero's criticisms of the government were very active from the beginning. His first attack against the government was based on its inability to control the rise in the price of [[fossil fuel]]. He asked for a reduction in the taxes affecting it.

In 2000, the [[Great Britain|British]] [[nuclear submarine]] ''[[HMS Tireless (S88)|HMS Tireless]]'' arrived at [[Gibraltar]] harbour to have its [[nuclear reactor]] repaired. Aznar affirmed that there was no risk for the population but Zapatero criticized him for his inability to force the British government to take the submarine to another harbour. After almost one year, the Tireless was repaired and left Gibraltar without having caused any known problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2001/05/04/espana/988995858.html |title=El 'Tireless' abandona Gibraltar, después de permanecer un año varado en el puerto del Peñón |publisher=Elmundo.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2001/05/10/espana/989488163.html |title=El Tribunal Supremo archiva la querella criminal contra Aznar y Blair por el 'caso Tireless' |publisher=Elmundo.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another point of friction came from the scheme to transfer water from the River Ebro to other areas especially the irrigated areas in the South East of Spain, one of the richest agricultural regions in the world. That scheme received support from, among others, 80% of the affected farmers and the Socialist regional governments of regions such as [[Extremadura]], [[Andalusia]] or [[Castilla-La Mancha]]. Some Socialist politicians also supported it when they were members of the former Socialist government back in the 90s (e.g. [[José Borrell]], the current leader of the European Spanish Socialist Group and former president of the European Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertaddigital.com:83/php3/noticia.php3?fecha_edi_on=2004-08-26&amp;num_edi_on=1436&amp;cpn=1276231106&amp;seccion=SOC_D Libertad Digital: Sociedad :: '''INFORME:''' Los argumentos de Borrell contra las desaladoras]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was mainly opposed by Zapatero, [[environmentalist]] groups, the Socialist regional government of [[Aragon, Spain|Aragon]] and some of the citizens of the areas from which water was to be transferred. The main criticisms of the scheme were the supposed damage to the environment and an argued real lack of sufficient water for all of the affected parties (the proponents of the scheme answered back that there was no risk of a serious environmental damage and that in 2003, 14 times more water reached the sea than what was needed annually). (The scheme, finally approved by the Government, was canceled by Zapatero soon after becoming Prime Minister.)

Zapatero was the main proponent of the &quot;Pacto de las Libertades contra el Terrorismo&quot; (&quot;Anti Terrorist Freedom pact) which was signed on 8 December 2000. In the first moment this pact was disliked and rejected but later was considered a cornerstone of the strategy against Basque terrorism in Spain not only by the Socialist Party but by the People's Party (currently, it is considered broken by the People's Party). Zapatero's harsher critics have argued that the Pact was originated by the wish of the People's Party and the Socialist Party in order to bury the Socialist ambiguity towards nationalist parties caused by the Socialist Party's reliance on their votes.

At the end of the year, the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|Mad Cow disease]] came back into the spotlight after its outbreak in 1996. Zapatero repeatedly criticized the Government's management of the crisis arguing that it was out of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2001/01/09/sociedad/979051673.html |title=Zapatero propone 10 medidas para combatir el mal de las 'vacas locas' |publisher=Elmundo.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2005, that disease has caused dozens of deaths all over [[Europe]], though none in Spain.

In 2001 one of the biggest points of friction between the government and the opposition were the proposed reforms affecting the education system. The People's Party introduced the so-called LOU first, a law to change the University System, and later the LOCE (''Organic Act for Education Quality''), which affected Secondary Education. Zapatero strongly opposed both. The People's Party used its absolute majority in the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] to pass its reforms but after it had taken place an important number of protests by Student's Unions took place, which were featured prominently in the public media although their protests had usually passed unnoticed until Zapatero's arrival.

A regional election was held in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] on 13 May 2001. The socialists received 17.8 percent of the vote (against 17.6 percent in the previous 1998 elections) but lost one seat. Both, the Socialist Party and the People's Party had formed an alliance against the then ruling nationalist Basque political movements but the latter won again. The results were considered a failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicolás Redondo Terreros]], the Basque Socialist leader during the election who was strongly opposed to Basque nationalism and to [[ETA]], resigned after some internal clashes, resigning his seat in the Basque parliament and in the Federal Executive. He was replaced by [[Patxi López]], elected on 24 March 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patxi López]] had actively supported Zapatero during his campaign to become Secretary General. [OCAM p.&amp;nbsp;257]

On 21 October 2001 a new regional election took place, this time in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. The People's Party (led by [[Manuel Fraga Iribarne]]) obtained a new absolute majority. The Socialist party increased its number of seats from 15 to 17, but, after several years of opposition the results were also considered bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=321}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two negative results seemed to confirm that Zapatero's approach was not working.

On 19 December 2001 Zapatero travelled to [[Morocco]], after the Moroccan government expelled the Spanish ambassador [[sine die]]. [[Javier Arenas (Spanish politician)|Javier Arenas]], a prominent member of the People's Party, accusing him of not being loyal to Spanish interests. Zapatero denied it and claimed that one of his purposes was to help solve the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===From 2002 to 2003===
In 2002, Zapatero was chosen as the Socialist candidate for the next General Election. He was appointed directly, without a prior primary election {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}.

In 2002, the People's Party Government decided to reform the system of [[unemployment benefits]], as it thought that there were too many workers who being able to find a job preferred to continue receiving public money. This led to a redefinition of those who were eligible for unemployment benefits. Left-wing parties and [[trade union]]s considered that redefinition an unacceptable reduction of rights. Zapatero became the political leader of the opposition against the reform (dubbed the ''Decretazo'', because it was passed using a decree-law), which served him as his first important clash with Aznar's government.

A General Strike was announced for 20 June 2002 (the first since Aznar won the election in 1996). According to official data (including the electrical power consumption and the number of worked man-days calculated by the Social Security) the turnout was lower than 15 percent, the lowest since the restoration of democracy (there were four General Strikes during Felipe González' premiership). The unions and Zapatero disbelieved the data and considered the strike a resounding success, with more than &quot;10 million&quot; workers. Whatever the result, both the People's Party government and the trade unions signed an agreement that satisfied both parties in November.

In May 2002, Felipe González declared in reference to the change in the Socialist Party that &quot;My state of mind tells me that a change has taken place, that perhaps a second Suresnes {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} has happened, but it has yet to be proved that a new project with content and ideas really exists&quot;, thus doubting Zapatero's leadership. That declaration was expressed in a public event also attended by Zapatero, who calmly expressed his disagreement. González ended his intervention by remembering that his candidate for Secretary General was [[José Bono]], not Zapatero. González backtracked the next day, declaring that either his words had been incorrectly construed or he had expressed his ideas erroneously. José Bono himself confirmed his total support for Zapatero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=310–311}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident seemed to confirm that Zapatero's strategy was not working.

On 22 October 2002 Zapatero spoke in the name of the Socialist Party during the debate about the National Budget. Initially, [[Jordi Sevilla]] was to have been the Socialist spokesman but, at the last moment, he was replaced in a surprise move. When Jordi Sevilla, after being called by the speaker, had already descended to the floor of the Congress of Deputies, Zapatero said to him &quot;let me do it&quot; and climbed to the orator platform. José María Aznar and other members of the People's Party had previously criticized him for not representing his party in the debate, suggesting a lack of the necessary political skills. Zapatero tried to prove it was false, and it seems that his action had quite a positive effect on his supporters; although the People's Party considered his action too theatrical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2002, the oil tanker ''[[Prestige oil spill|Prestige]]'' suffered an accident in international waters{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} near [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] (a region in the Northwestern tip of Spain) that caused a grave oil slick which mainly affected Galicia, but also, to a lesser degree all the northern coast of Spain, and even the coast of France. The tanker was ordered by the governmental authorities to be moved away from the coast because it seems that the oil is easier to recover from the water than from the sand – for example, special ships already prepared for that exist – and increasing the distance increases the affected area but decreases the number of irremediably affected places. The ''Prestige'' finally split and sank.

Zapatero blamed the PP Government management during and after the accident&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2002/12/28/ciencia/1041089253.html |title=ciencia |publisher=elmundo.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the accident. The decision to take the tanker away was especially criticized as Zapatero expressed it to be unnecessary. Zapatero thought that it should have been allowed to enter a harbour.

The accident and its consequences became the main source of Socialist criticisms and the biggest point of friction, together with Iraq, until the election of 2004. A Socialist MP in the Regional Assembly of Madrid, Antonio Carmona, declared soon after the catastrophe: &quot;We have more than enough votes, if not, we will sink another boat&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plus.es/codigo/noticias/especiales/fichanoticia.asp?id=201242&amp;noti=202359 |title=cnn+ – La Tragedia del Prestige |publisher=Plus.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned because of this statement. [[Jesús Caldera]], who became a minister after the victory in 2004, was heavily criticized by the People's Party for using a manipulated document relative to the route of the ''Prestige'' in a parliamentary debate about the catastrophe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; These events were used by the People Party's &quot;to demonstrate&quot; the &quot;demagogical strategy&quot; of the Socialist Party.

Probably, the main point of friction between Aznar and Zapatero was the war in Iraq. Opinion polls showed that a clear majority of Spanish voters (around 90 percent) were against the U.S.-led attack against [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime. Among them, Zapatero who considered any action against Saddam's regime to be illegal and who was opposed to the very concept of [[preemptive war]].

On 26 May 2003 a [[Yakovlev Yak-42]] plane carrying Spanish soldiers coming home from [[Afghanistan]] crashed in [[Turkey]]. The plane had been hired by an agency of [[NATO]] and any other country could have used it. In Zapatero's view it presented clear dangers and he blamed Aznar and his government for neglecting aspects like the plane insurance or safety. Further, Aznar had rejected calls for a full inquiry into the crash.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsws&quot;&gt;[http://www.wsws.org/articles/2003/nov2003/crsh-n25.shtml Spain: &quot;Relatives of military plane crash victims met with official indifference&quot; by Keith Lee. 25 November 2003. World Socialist Web Site]. Retrieved 26 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2004 March elections it was proven that there had been serious irregularities when recognizing the bodies with an important number of mistakes in the identifications.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsws&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.el-mundo.es/documentos/2003/05/espana/accidente_ejercito/ |title=Documentos |publisher=Elmundo.Es |date=2003-05-26 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the [[European Constitution]], Zapatero criticized the People's Party Government for fighting to preserve the distribution of power agreed by the [[Nice]] treaty (December 2000) in the new European Constitution. Zapatero thought that Spain should accept a lesser share of power.

====2003 local elections====
{{BLP sources section|date=January 2009}}
On 25 May 2003, the first local and regional elections since Zapatero's appointment as leader of the Socialist party took place. The Socialist Party received a larger popular vote (which prompted Zapatero to claim his party had been the winner) but the People's Party obtained more posts in councils and regional governments. In general, there were not many changes in the results compared to those of the previous Elections held in 1999. The Socialists lost the [[Balearic Islands]] but got enough votes in [[Madrid]] to govern through a coalition with the communists of the [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]]. The last &quot;victory&quot; was welcomed by Zapatero as the winner in Madrid had always won the next general election. However, an unexpected scandal, the so-called Madrid Assembly Scandal, negatively affected the socialist expectations of a victory in 2004.

After the Madrid election, the People's Party lacked two seats to obtain an absolute majority. This seemed to allow an alliance of Socialists and the United Left to seize power. But an unexpected event happened. Eduardo Tamayo and María Teresa Sáez, two Socialist MPs angry at the distribution of power in the future regional government between the United Left and the Socialist Party started a crisis that led to a re-run of the Election in Madrid in October 2003 with the subsequent victory of the People's Party.

Zapatero did not accept the account of the Socialist MPs and tried to explain it as a conspiratorial plot caused by speculative interests of the house building industry that would have bribed the MPs to prevent a left-wing government.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The People's Party, on the other hand, defended the theory that the anger of the two Socialist MPs was caused by Zapatero's broken promise about the referred distribution of power within the Madrid section of the Socialist Party. That promise would have been made some months before the crisis in exchange of support for one of his more immediate collaborators ([[Trinidad Jiménez]]), who wanted to become the Socialist candidate for mayor of Madrid (the Spanish capital).

It was known that Eduardo Tamayo had played an active role in Zapatero's appointment as Secretary General of the party (See [[Zapatero's years as an opposition leader#Appointment as Secretary General]]), together with José Luis Balbás, the leader of the internal faction to which Eduardo Tamayo belonged, who was also expelled from the party because of the scandal.

Zapatero's team had entered into contact with José Luis Balbás through Enrique Martínez and [[Jesús Caldera]] (current Minister of Labor), who already knew him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2000, Zapatero, Caldera and José Blanco had had lunch with Eduardo Tamayo in a restaurant in Madrid. Tamayo would become later a representative of Zapatero in the 35th party national conference. At the end of the month &quot;Renovadores de la Base&quot; (the faction of Tamayo and Balbás) decided to support Zapatero and the later agreed to be part of Zapatero's team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=238–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played an important role during Zapatero's promotion. For example, Balbás together with [[José Blanco]] controlled the list of delegates. It was a fundamental job, as the different tasks of promotion needed that list, at least, to contact the delegates for the conference.

This was used by Zapatero's rivals to introduce doubts over Zapatero's leadership of the Socialist Party and over his honesty.

During the Debate over the State of the Nation, an annual debate that takes place every year in the [[Spanish Congress of Deputies]], Zapatero was harshly criticised by José María Aznar on account of the scandal. For the first time, the opinion polls showed that most Spaniards believed that the then Spanish Prime Minister had been the winner (Zapatero had always been considered the winner since his first debate in 2001).

The scandal was especially damaging for the Socialists because they had to overcome their reputation of being a corrupt party to again become the government of Spain. The two MP's rebellion seemed to prove they were unable to solve their old problems.

Later, in October, a regional election took place in Catalonia, whose results were worse than expected for the Socialist Party. All the [[Autonomous communities of Spain]] hold the elections to their assemblies the same day, with the exception of [[Andalusia]], [[Catalonia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]. That day coincides with the municipal elections all over Spain. Therefore, the results are hugely significant.

On 16 November 2003, the regional election for the [[Parliament of Catalonia|Assembly of Catalonia]] was held. Two days before, Zapatero had predicted a historic victory for the [[Socialists' Party of Catalonia]] and the beginning of the People's Party defeat. The Socialist Party won the election in popular vote but CiU obtained more MPs due to the electoral law. The final results were 46 seats for [[Convergence and Union]] (CiU) (ten fewer than in 1999, the year of the previous election), 42 for the Socialist Party (ten fewer), 15 for the People's Party (three more), 9 for [[Iniciativa per Catalunya-Verds]] and 23 (nine more) for the [[Republican Left of Catalonia]]. Zapatero attributed the bad results to the consequences of the crisis of Madrid. However, Maragall became the President of the Regional Government after a Pact with Republican Left of Catalonia and Iniciativa per Catalunya-Verds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That alliance resulted in another setback for the Socialist Party when the Spanish newspaper [[Diario ABC|ABC]] published an article stating that Josep-Lluís [[Carod-Rovira]], leader of Republican Left of Catalonia, had met some [[ETA]] members secretly in January 2004. According to ABC, Carod-Rovira had promised to provide ETA with political support if the group did not act in Catalonia, which seemed to have been confirmed by the ETA announcement of a truce affecting only that region some months later, before the general election of 2004. Carod-Rovira resigned as vice president of the Catalan government, but continued to be the leader of his party. The scandal damaged Zapatero's image, as ETA and political violence are controversial issues in Spain and Carod-Rovira's party was seen as a possible ally if Zapatero won the election.

At end of 2003 and the beginning of 2004 the Spanish political parties started to prepare themselves for the [[Spanish legislative election, 2004|general election of 2004]]. All of the opinion polls elaborated at the time foreseen a defeat for Zapatero, as they always predicted a new victory for the People's Party. (''See [[Zapatero and the 2004 General Election]]'')

==The 2004 general election==
===Election campaign===
The campaign for the General Election started a fortnight before 14 March 2004. Polls favoured the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]], with some polls predicting a possible repeat of their absolute majority.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

Previously, on 8 January 2004, Zapatero had created a Committee of Notables composed of 10 highly qualified experts with  considerable political weight. Its mission was to help him to become prime minister. Among its members: [[José Bono]] (his ex-rival for the Secretaryship of the party and later appointed Minister of Defence), [[Juan Carlos Rodríguez Ibarra]] (president of the regional government of [[Extremadura]] and one of the most important socialist leaders), [[Miguel Ángel Moratinos]] (his minister of Foreign affairs 2004–2010), [[Gregorio Peces-Barba]] (later appointed by him High Commissioner for the Victims of Terrorism, although he has already made public his resignation), [[Carmen Calvo]] (later appointed Minister of Culture), etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten days later, on 18 January 2004, Zapatero announced that he would only become prime minister if the Spanish Socialist Workers Party received a plurality, renouncing possible parliamentary alliances in advance if that situation did not happen after the election. Minority parties (especially [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]], a communist party) criticized the decision, for they considered it an attempt to attract their own voters, who would rather ensure a defeat of the People's Party even at the expense of voting for an unfavorable party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zapatero's slogan became &quot;we deserve a better Spain&quot;, which was coupled with &quot;Zapatero Presidente&quot;, or &quot;(ZP)&quot;, which itself has become a popular nickname of the current Spanish Prime Minister.

====Campaign promises====
* 180,000 new houses every year to buy or to rent
* Preservation of a balanced budget with no deficit but with a more flexible approach than that of the People's Party
* [[Bilingual education]] (English and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], together with the official regional language in the areas where it existed)
* A computer for every two students
* A two year maximum for legal processes or financial compensation
* Further investment in research and development
* Make the [[Televisión Española|state-owned television company]] more independent from the government by making its director answerable to parliament, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=312}}&lt;/ref&gt;).{{Verify source|date=April 2007}}

During the campaign, Zapatero harshly criticized the People's Party for its management of the ''[[Prestige oil spill|Prestige]]'' crisis, its attitude towards the invasion of [[Iraq]] and the high cost of housing. [[Mariano Rajoy]], the new leader of the People's Party after [[José María Aznar|Aznar's]] voluntary retirement, on his part, attacked Zapatero's foreseeable future alliances with parties like United Left or Republican Left of Catalonia (a pro-Independence Catalan party).

One of the most important points of friction was the absence of televised debates between the candidates. Zapatero was the first to propose a debate to Mariano Rajoy. Rajoy accepted on the condition that Zapatero could not be alone but accompanied at least by two of his potential allies after the election: [[Gaspar Llamazares]] (the leader of United Left) and [[Josep-Lluís Carod-Rovira]] (leader of [[Republican Left of Catalonia]]). Rajoy justified his decision on the grounds that, in his opinion, he was not running against the Socialist Party but against a &quot;coalition&quot; of forces opposed to the People's Party's policies. Zapatero never formally responded to this proposal and throughout the campaign he continued criticizing what he always defined as Rajoy's reluctance to defend his political program face-to-face. (Zapatero has promised to change electoral law to make televised debates compulsory.)

===Madrid Bombings===
On 11 March 2004 the most deadly peacetime [[11 March 2004 Madrid attacks|attacks]] in Spanish history took place. Several commuter trains were bombed, causing 191 deaths and outrage all over Spain. The attacks took place three days before the General Election and all electoral activities were suspended. The common sorrow, instead of promoting unity among Spaniards, increased the already bitter tone of the campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Matthews |first=Owen |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6733216/site/newsweek/ |title=Reliving the Past - Newsweek: International Editions - MSNBC.com |publisher=MSNBC |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The People's Party government and Zapatero (who accused ETA in a radio statement broadcast at 8:50 a.m.), initially claimed the attacks to be the work of ETA, an armed [[Basque nationalism|Basque nationalist]] separatist organization. Later, after an audiotape in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] was found in a van near a railway station where the perpetrators boarded one of the trains, Aznar declared that all of the possibilities were being investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3504950.stm | work=BBC News | title=Spain casts wide net for bombers | date=12 March 2004 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government was accused of manipulating information about who was responsible for the attacks to avoid the consequences of public anger at a bombing motivated by its foreign policy – Aznar personally phoned the editors of the four national daily newspapers to tell them that ETA were responsible, whilst Minister of the Interior [[Ángel Acebes]] attacked those who believed that responsibility lay elsewhere, despite not offering any evidence for ETA's culpability,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2004/mar/15/comment.spain |title=Spun out of office |accessdate=4 August 2008|last=Mathieson |first=David|date=15 March 2004|publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the state broadcaster [[Televisión Española|TVE]] initially failed to report the protest outside the Popular Party's headquarters which ran through the night before the day of the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/mar/15/spain.angeliquechrisafis |title=Angry voters demand to know the truth behind carnage |accessdate=4 August 2008|last=Chrisafis |first=Angelique|date=15 March 2004|publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zapatero himself has repeatedly accused the Popular Party of lying about those who were responsible for the attacks. On the other hand, the book ''11-M. La venganza'' by Casimiro Abadillo, a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] journalist who works for the newspaper ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'', claims that, before the General Election, Zapatero had told that newspaper's director, Pedro J. Ramirez, that two [[suicide bombing|suicide bombers]] had been found among the victims (although the specialists that examined the bodies said they found no such evidence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.periodistadigital.com/object.php?o=31156 |title=Blogs |publisher=Periodista Digital |date=2008-10-22 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was asked in December 2004 about the issue by the Parliamentary Investigative Committee created to find the truth about the attacks, he declared that he did not remember what he had said.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

===Election day===

The campaign had ended abruptly two days before it was expected to convene as a result of the bombings. The day before the elections — in this case 13 March 2004 — is considered to be a &quot;Day of Reflection&quot; under Spanish electoral law, with candidates and their parties legally barred from political campaigning. Despite this prohibition, numerous demonstrations took place against the government of José María Aznar in front of the premises of the People's Party all over Spain. There were some claims that most of these demonstrations were instigated or orchestrated by the Socialist Party, through the use of SMS text messaging from mobile phones belonging to the Socialist Party. The Socialist Party publicly denied these accusations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

As the demonstrations escalated, Mariano Rajoy himself appeared on national TV to denounce the illegal demonstrations. In reply, both José Blanco and Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba broke the silence from the Socialist Party's side, in separate appearances. In the end both sides accused each other of breaking the electoral law on reflection day.

In this climate of social unrest and post-attack shock, the [[Spanish general election, 2004|elections]] were held on 14 March 2004. Zapatero's Socialist Party won the elections, with 164 seats in the Cortes, while the People's Party obtained 148. It seems likely that the election result was influenced to a greater or lesser extent by the Spanish public's response to the attacks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3506370.stm |title=Spain bombs 'to drive poll turnout' |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-03-14 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the informative coverage by the different media and political parties. He took office on 17 April.

===Influence of the attacks on the election outcome===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2010}}

An important point of controversy is if the purpose of the Madrid attacks were to force a Socialist victory; at issue as well was that, if that was the case, whether they succeeded in altering the final result. This has been called the &quot;4 March theory&quot; (that is, if the election had been scheduled for 7 March, the attacks would have taken place on 4 March) by Aznar, among others. No definitive data exists in favour of that possibility but some facts have been used to support it. Thus, the first question Jamal Zougam (one of the first arrested suspects) made when he arrived at the Courthouse on 15 March 2004 was: 'Who won the election?'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matthews |first=Owen |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4571262/site/newsweek/ |title=International Periscope &amp; Perspectives - Newsweek: International Editions - MSNBC.com |publisher=MSNBC |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How the bombing influenced the results is widely debated. The three schools of thought are:

* The attacks themselves might have changed the electoral winner. A sufficient number of voters suddenly decided to vote for the Socialist party because they thought that if it won, Islamist terrorism would be placated.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

* The handling of the attacks by the government, rather than the attacks themselves, might have changed the electoral winner. People who had the perception that the information about the attacks was being manipulated decided to vote the Socialist party as a response.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

* The attacks might have changed the result but not the winner. The Socialist Party was going to win but with fewer votes. (Despite this claim, most polls before the attacks gave a victory to [[Mariano Rajoy]].)

At least some of these controversies put a blemish on Zapatero's victory, as the shadow of what had happened the three previous days did not allow the Socialist Party to fully enjoy its triumph.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

The electoral result was considered by some foreign media,{{Which?|date=February 2009}} especially in the US, an example of weakness that would encourage further terrorist attacks,{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} as Zapatero had opposed [[George W. Bush]]'s policy in the [[Middle East]] and had promised to withdraw the Spanish troops from Iraq.

The theory that the bombing affected the result is a [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] that cannot be verified. As elections in European states hinge on social and economic policies mainly, it is equally possible the terrorist events had no notable effect. In this regard, a majority of 74%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup-international.com/ContentFiles/survey.asp?id=10 |title=Iraq Survey 2003 Results PDF (to download) |publisher=Gallup-international.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Spanish people were against Spanish involvement in the war.

On 13 June 2004 (three months after the General Election) the Election for the [[European Parliament]] took place. The Socialist Party tied with 25 seats vs 25 for the People's Party (out of 54), but narrowly won in popular vote. Although [[José Borrell]] was the official candidate, Zapatero played an important role in that campaign (as is usual in Spain).

His style's defining word is ''(buen) talante'', roughly &quot;pleasantness&quot;, &quot;niceness&quot; or &quot;good disposition&quot;, which is in brisk and carefully chosen contrast with the more confrontational and brusque premiership style of previous Prime Minister [[José María Aznar]]. Similarly, Zapatero has been quoted to shy away from adopting unpopular measures, having a &quot;habit of showering public money on any problem&quot; and, in all, being &quot;averse to tough decisions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14130653 |title=Premium content |publisher=Economist.com |date=2009-07-30 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Withdrawal from Iraq===
One of the first measures he carried out as soon as he took office was to withdraw every Spanish soldier fighting in Iraq, which he did in less than a month. This drew criticism from the right, who held the view that he was ceding to the pressure of the terrorists who attacked Spain. However, it was a measure announced by him before the general elections and supported by the majority of Spanish population.

===Domestic policy===
Much of Zapatero's work has been on social issues, including [[gender]]-motivated violence and discrimination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universia.es/portada/actualidad/noticia_actualidad.jsp?noticia=73446 |title=Hoy-Aprueba-Ley-Violencia-Genero |publisher=Universia.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[divorce]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/07/09/espana/1120903826.html |title=La ley del divorcio entra en vigor hoy tras ser publicada ayer en el BOE – españa |publisher=elmundo.es |date=2005-06-30 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/04/21/espana/1114087944.html |title=El Congreso aprueba el matrimonio entre personas del mismo sexo |publisher=elmundo.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent social issue tackled has been the Dependency Law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=20minutos.es. 20.04.2006 – 11.21 h |url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/111088/0/ministros/ley/dependencia/ |title=Unos 12.000 millones de euros en ayudas para más de un millón de personas dependientes |publisher=20minutos.es |date=2006-04-20 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; a plan to regulate help and resources for people in dire need of them, and who cannot provide for themselves and must rely on others on a daily basis. Zapatero has also made it clear that he values funding of research and development and higher education and believes them to be essential for Spain's economic competitiveness. At the same time, he has increased the [[minimum wage]] and pursued other classically socialist policies. He has also announced his intention to undertake limited reforms to the [[Spanish Constitution]], though no specifics have been made available.

===Economic problems===
Facing a recession and rising unemployment, ZP pledged to cut government spending by 4.5% and raise taxes, but not income taxes.  The Popular Party contends that ZP lacked a coherent economic plan and stated &quot;There is no tax increase capable of filling the hole that you have created,&quot;. On June 23, 2008 Zapatero announced 21 reforms designed to aid economic recovery in a speech pointedly avoiding popular terms of the period such as 'crisis'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wikileaks.ch/cable/2008/06/08MADRID707.html |title=ZAPATERO ANNOUNCES MEASURES TO ADDRESS ECONOMIC SITUATION, REACTION SKEPTICAL |date=2008-06-25 |accessdate=2010-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although government deficits are projected to increase to 10% of GDP, ZP promises to reduce it to 3% required by EU policy by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Catan |first=Thomas |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125249000052995119.html |title=Spain Raises Taxes as Budget Crisis Deepens - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2009-09-10 |accessdate=2010-06-04}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011 Spain's Unemployment Rate had risen to 20.33% exceeding Prime Minister Zapatero's target rate of 19.4 percent.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110128/bs_afp/spaineconomyunemployment_20110128120624&lt;/ref&gt;

===LGBT rights===

The legalization of [[same-sex marriage in Spain]] on 1 July 2005 includes [[LGBT adoption|adoption rights]] as well as other rights that were previously only available to [[heterosexual]] couples. This caused a stir within the [[Catholic Church]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4473001.stm | work=BBC News | title=Vatican condemns Spain gay bill | date=22 April 2005 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which opposed the measures and supported a demonstration attended by some 166,000 (according to official figures) and one million people (according to the organisers) in [[Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=20 minutos.es. 19.06.2005 – 01.17 h |url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/32519/0/manifestacion/matrimonio/homosexual |title=manifestación contra matrimonio gay |publisher=20minutos.es |date=2005-06-19 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Zapatero's government was also responsible for a Gender Identity Law that allows [[transsexual]] persons the right to have their identity legally recognised, the criteria being one clinical evaluation and two years of treatment (generally hormone replacement therapy), and without demanding mandatory genital surgery or irreversible sterility.  The law is, alongside with the legislation of some US states, one of the most simple and non-bureaucratic that currently exist in the world.  Transsexual persons also have the right to marry persons of the opposite or same sex they have transitioned into, and to biologically parent children either before or after transitioning.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Regional territorial tensions===

Zapatero has often declared that his government will not be &quot;soft on terrorism&quot; and will not allow regional nationalists to endanger Spanish unity. Some say{{Who|date=March 2009}} that this comment was probably made for his party alliances with parties like [[Republican Left of Catalonia]].

On 13 November 2003 in a rally in [[Barcelona]] during the election campaign that took [[Pasqual Maragall]] to power in the [[Generalitat]], Rodríguez Zapatero gave a famous promise to approve the [[Statute of Catalonia]]:
:''I will support the reform of the Statute of Catalonia that the Parliament of Catalonia approves.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquerra.org/nouestatut/videozp.php?s=2 |title=L'Estatut Sencer. Cap Retallada A Madrid! |publisher=Esquerra.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2005, a controversial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barcelonareporter.com/index.php?/comments/erc_form_roadblock_on_path_to_catalan_statute_reform/ |title=ERC form roadblock on path to Catalan statute reform |accessdate=4 August 2008|date=21 March 2006|publisher=[[El País]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposal to reform the Catalan statute arrived at the Spanish parliament after being passed in Catalonia. Zapatero, who had often expressed his support for a change of the statute (although he did not entirely support the draft passed by the Catalan Parliament), supported the reform.

===Spanish Civil War remnants===

In October 2004 Zapatero's government undertook the task of morally and legally rehabilitating those who were suppressed during and after the [[Spanish Civil War]], by instituting a Memorial Commission chaired by Vice-Prime Minister [[María Teresa Fernández de la Vega]].

On 17 March 2005, Zapatero's government ordered the removal of the last remaining statue of former [[dictator]] [[Francisco Franco]] that remained in Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/03/17/madrid/1111018865.html |title=El Gobierno retira la estatua de Franco en Nuevos Ministerios |publisher=elmundo.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reform of the education system===
{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}
Just after he took office, Zapatero repealed the law reforming the Education System passed by the previous government and, in November 2005, introduced his own reform bill. The bill was opposed by the People's Party, the Catholic Church, the [[Muslim]] community, The Catholic Confederation of [[Parent]]s' Associations and an important part of the educational community, often for disparate reasons. Complaints against the reform include the limits it imposes upon parents' freedom to choose a school, the decrease in academic status of voluntary religious education, the introduction of a compulsory course (&quot;[[Education for Citizenship (Spain)|Education for Citizenship]]&quot;) and a perceived ineffectiveness of the reform in terms of combating poor educational results. The last complaint would be reinforced by the opinion that Spain has ranked poorly amongst the developed countries in the quality and results of its education.

After a major demonstration took place against this education reform, the government held a series of meetings with many of the organizations that opposed the reform, reaching agreements with some of them (especially parents' associations and teachers' unions). Some others, most prominently the People's Party and the Catholic Church remain staunchly opposed to it.

===ETA===

{{Main|ETA's 2006 &quot;permanent ceasefire&quot;}}

[[ETA]] declared what it described at the time as a &quot;permanent [[ceasefire]]&quot; that began on midnight 23 March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/ETA/declara/alto/fuego/permanente/elpporesp/20060322elpepunac_3/Tes |title=ETA declara un alto el fuego permanente · ELPAÍS.com |publisher=Elpais.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 5 June 2007 ETA declared this ceasefire over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jason Webb |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSL0526292220070605 |title=Basque rebels ETA say ending Spanish ceasefire &amp;#124; U.S. |publisher=Reuters |date= 5 June 2007|accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the initial ceasefire declaration Zapatero informed the Congress that steps would be taken to negotiate with ETA in order to end its terrorist campaign while denying that there would be any political price paid to put an end to ETA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/06/29/espana/1151579293.html |title=Zapatero anuncia el inicio del diálogo con ETA |publisher=elmundo.es |date=2006-06-29 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PP grew concerned about the possibility of political concessions being made to the group to stop their ways, and actively opposed anything other than the possibility of an organized surrender and dismantling of ETA, refusing to support any kind of negotiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/06/29/espana/1151583675.html |title=Unos contactos sin el respaldo del PP |publisher=elmundo.es |date=2006-06-29 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 December 2006 the ceasefire was broken when a car bomb exploded in [[2006 Madrid Barajas International Airport bombing|Madrid's International Airport, Barajas]] and ETA claimed authorship. Following this, Zapatero gave orders to halt initiatives leading to negotiations with ETA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Zapatero/He/ordenado/suspender/todas/iniciativas/desarrollar/dialogo/ETA/elpepuesp/20061230elpepunac_4/Tes |title=Zapatero: &quot;He ordenado suspender todas las iniciativas para desarrollar el diálogo con ETA&quot; · ELPAÍS.com |publisher=Elpais.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrations across Spain followed the next day, most condemning the attack, others condemning the Government's policies and a minority even questioning the authorship of the Madrid bombings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/12/30/espana/1167494632.html |title=Miles de ciudadanos muestran su rechazo a ETA y a la política del Gobierno |publisher=elmundo.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A massive rally in Madrid followed on 25 February 2007 promoted by the Victims of Terrorism Association (AVT in Spanish acronym), rejecting what are perceived to be concessions from the government to the separatists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5068616.stm | work=BBC News | title=Don't surrender to Eta, protesters say | date=11 June 2006 | accessdate=7 May 2010 | first=Danny | last=Wood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 March 2007 a new massive rally was held in Madrid gathering -depending on the source's relationships to the government-  between 342,000 and over two million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2007/03/10/espana/1173524078.html?a=6f03dc6c2fb364817ee69020399bc9f2&amp;t=1173591131 |title=Rajoy llama a 'defender España' ante cientos de miles de personas en Madrid |publisher=elmundo.es |date=2006-11-22 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstration was organized by the opposition party PP and backed by the AVT and several other associations of victims, to not allow [[Iñaki de Juana Chaos]] out of prison and accusing Zapatero's government of surrendering to terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6438623.stm | work=BBC News | title=Madrid rally over ETA man release | date=10 March 2007 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration===

During the meeting of the European Union Justice and Home Affairs Ministers held in [[Tampere]] on 22 September 2006, some of the European ministers reprimanded the Spanish authorities for the aforementioned massive regularisation of undocumented immigrants which was regarded as too loose and opposed to the policies of other State members (on 2 September and 3 alone, during the height of the last illegal immigration wave, 2,283 people arrived illegally in the [[Canary Islands]] having shipped from [[Senegal]] aboard 27 [[pirogue]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/09/21/espana/1158825738.html |title='España no se va a hundir por 25.000 inmigrantes; en Alemania lo solucionamos nosotros mismos' |publisher=elmundo.es |date=2006-09-21 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.es/articulo/espana/Alonso/opuso/Gobierno/Armada/interceptara/barcas/inmigrantes/elpporesp/20061009elpepinac_4/Tes/ |title=El País, 9 October 2006, in Spanish |publisher=Elpais.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once they reach Spanish territory, the undocumented immigrants can travel freely -for the internal frontiers are basically open within the [[European Union]] (with the exception of the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]] who maintain full border controls); thus, it is not unknown for some of them have other European countries as their final destinations. This started a short lived polemic between France's [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] and the Spanish premier Rodríguez Zapatero.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertaddigital.com:83/php3/opi_desa.php3?fecha_edi_on=2006-10-01&amp;num_edi_on=1457&amp;cpn=33602&amp;tipo=&amp;seccion=OPI_D Libertad Digital – EDITORIAL – Zapatero, Sarkozy y la inmigración]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadenaser.com/articulo/espana/Zapatero/Sarkozy/dan/superada/polemica/politica/inmigracion/csrcsrpor/20060930csrcsrnac_1/Tes/ |title=Zapatero y Sarkozy dan por superada su polémica sobre política de inmigración en |publisher=Cadenaser.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lavanguardia.es/gen/20060929/51285375563/noticias/sarkozy-replica-a-zapatero-no-doy-lecciones-a-nadie-ni-tampoco-me-gusta-que-me-las-den-francia-madrid-miguel-angel-moratinos-teresa-fernandez-waldner.html ]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of foreign policy action==
===Iraq===
Before being elected, Zapatero opposed the American policy in regard to [[Iraq]] pursued by former Spanish Prime Minister Aznar. During the electoral campaign Zapatero had promised to withdraw the troops if control in Iraq was not passed to the [[United Nations]] after 30 June (the ending date of the initial Spanish military agreement with the multinational coalition that had overthrown Saddam Hussein). Zapatero declared that he did not intend to withdraw the Spanish troops before that date after being questioned about the issue by the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party's]] leader [[Mariano Rajoy]] in his inauguration parliamentary debate as Prime Minister.

On 19 April 2004 Zapatero announced the withdrawal of the 1,300 Spanish troops in [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2004/04/18/espana/1082303152.html |title=Zapatero anuncia la retirada inmediata de las tropas de Irak |publisher=elmundo.es |date=2004-03-30 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision aroused international support worldwide, though the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] claimed that terrorists could perceive it as &quot;a victory obtained due to the [[11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings]]&quot;. [[John Kerry]], then [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic party]] candidate for the U.S. Presidency, asked Zapatero not to withdraw the Spanish soldiers. Some months after withdrawing the troops, the Zapatero government agreed to increase the number of Spanish soldiers in [[Afghanistan]] and to send troops to [[Haiti]] to show the Spanish Government's willingness to spend resources on international missions approved by the [[United Nations]].

On 8 June 2004, with the withdrawal already complete, Zapatero's government voted in the [[United Nations Security Council]] in favour of Resolution 1546 where the following could be read:

:&quot;''The Security Council, Recognising the importance of international support [...] for the [[Iraqi people|people of Iraq]] [...], Affirming the importance of international assistance in reconstruction and development of the Iraqi economy [...]''

:''15. Requests Member States and international and regional organizations to contribute assistance to the multinational force, including '''military forces''', as agreed with the Government of Iraq, to help meet the needs of the Iraqi people for security and stability, humanitarian and reconstruction assistance, and to support the efforts of UNAMI;''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2004/sc8117.doc.htm |title=SECURITY COUNCIL ENDORSES FORMATION OF SOVEREIGN INTERIM GOVERNMENT IN IRAQ; WELCOMES END OF OCCUPATION BY 30 JUNE, DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS BY JANUARY 2005 |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin America===
{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}
{{See also|¿Por qué no te callas?}}
An important change in Spanish foreign policy was Zapatero's decision to approach left-wing leaders such as [[Cuba]]'s [[Fidel Castro]] and [[Venezuela]]'s [[Hugo Chávez]]. Zapatero has played an important role in the improvement of the relationship between the Cuban government and the [[European Union]].

At the end of March 2005, Zapatero travelled to Venezuela to sign a deal to sell military ships and aircraft to Venezuela worth around [[US$]]1 billion. The US government attempted to intervene but failed, accusing Venezuela of being a &quot;dangerous country.&quot;

After the election of [[Evo Morales]] in [[Bolivia]], Spain was one of the countries the new president visited during his first international tour.

At the 2007 Ibero-American Summit, Chávez called Zapatero's predecessor [[José María Aznar]] a [[fascist]] for allegedly supporting the 2002 coup attempt. Zapatero used his speaking time to defend Aznar, noting that he was &quot;democratically elected by the Spanish people.&quot; Chávez kept trying to interrupt Zapatero, even as summit organisers turned off his microphone. [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos]], who was seated beside Zapatero, attempted to rebuke Chávez, but was stopped by Zapatero who, displaying significant patience, told him to wait a moment. When Chávez continued to interrupt Zapatero, Juan Carlos, in a rare outburst of anger, asked Chávez &quot;[[¿Por qué no te callas?]]&quot; (Why don't you shut up?). The king left the hall shortly afterwards when the [[President of Nicaragua]] began to criticize the Spanish government as well. Zapatero continued to participate in the negotiations, later delivering, to loud applause, a speech demanding respect for the leaders of other countries.

===United States===
The relations between José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero and former U.S. president [[George W. Bush]] were difficult, mostly as a result of Zapatero's opposition to the war in Iraq.

On 12 October 2003, during the [[Fiesta Nacional de España]] military parade held in Madrid, then [[opposition leader]] and presidential candidate Zapatero remained seated as a [[U.S. Marine Corps]] honour guard carrying the [[American flag]] walked past Zapatero and other VIPs. Everybody else stood as with the rest of the foreign guest armies representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.flickr.com/6/9292746_65f56a3c38_o.jpg |title=Zapatero (right, bottom) seated during the Fiesta Nacional's military parade in 2003 as the Stars and Stripes marched |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He declared afterwards that his action was a protest against the war and certainly not intended as an insult to the American people.

Later on, during an official visit to Tunisia shortly after Zapatero was elected, he asked all of the countries with troops in Iraq to withdraw their soldiers. This declaration moved Bush to send a letter expressing discontent to the Spanish premier.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

American troops were subsequently instructed to not take part during the traditional military parade on the Spanish national holiday in 2004 and in 2005, something which they used to, as both the Spanish and American armies –being [[NATO]] allies– are part of joint humanitarian missions; American troops returned to the military parade in 2006; this time Zapatero, being the Spanish premier, stood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/desfile/Dia/Fiesta/Nacional/rinde/homenaje/misiones/internacionales/elpporesp/20061012elpepunac_4/Tes |title=El desfile del Día de la Fiesta Nacional rinde homenaje a las misiones internacionales · ELPAÍS.com |publisher=Elpais.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zapatero publicly stated his support for [[John Kerry]] as a candidate running in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|U.S. Presidential election in 2004]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,114568,00.html |title=Kerry Rejects Foreign Endorsement – You Decide 2004 |publisher=FOXNews.com |date=2004-03-19 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the election took place, winner George W. Bush did not return Zapatero's congratulation phone call, though the [[White House]] firmly denied that Bush's intention was to snub the Spanish prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,11069-1354071,00.html | work=The Times | location=London | title=The President is too busy to call Spain told | first1=Roland | last1=Watson | first2=Edward | last2=Owen | date=11 November 2004 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile Zapatero repeatedly insisted that Spain's relations with the United States were good. In spite of that, Zapatero acknowledged years after that the phone conversation held with President George W. Bush was &quot;unforgettable&quot; and that when told that the Spanish troops were leaving Iraq, the American president had told him &quot;I am very disappointed in you&quot; and that the conversation ended in a &quot;very cold&quot; manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;hastalavista&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/opinion/09Cohen.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin &quot;Hasta la Vista, Baby&quot; by Roger Cohen. ''The New York Times''. Published: 8 October 2008 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Zapatero later told a ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter off the record that he had a “certain consideration” for Bush, because “I recognise that my electoral success has been influenced by his governing style&quot;. i.e. that Bush was so unpopular in Spain that he helped Zapatero win in 2004 and 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;hastalavista&quot;/&gt;

In March 2009, Spain announced that it would withdraw its forces from [[Kosovo Force|Kosovo]]. [[State Department|US State Department]] spokesman Robert Wood issued unusually strong criticism by stating that the United States was &quot;deeply disappointed&quot; by the decision. He said that Washington only learned of the move shortly before Spain announced it publicly. Spanish Defense Minister [[Carme Chacon]] made the announcement saying, &quot;The mission has been completed and it is time to return home.&quot; Asked if the United States shared that assessment, Wood said, &quot;Not at all.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iht.com/articles/ap/2009/03/20/business/US-Spain-Kosovo.php |title=Search – Global Edition – The New York Times |publisher=International Herald Tribune |date=2009-03-29 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]] stated that the American relationship with Spain goes beyond &quot;whatever disagreement we may have over Kosovo&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/28/AR2009032801352.html | work=The Washington Post}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}

Zapatero's predecessor, [[José María Aznar]], defended a strong [[Atlanticist]] policy. Zapatero has downplayed that policy in favour of a [[Pro-Europeanism|pan-European]] one. He has also sponsored the idea of an [[Alliance of Civilizations]] which is co-sponsored by [[Prime Minister of Turkey|Turkish Prime Minister]] [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]].

In the writing of what was to be the [[European Constitution]] Zapatero accepted the distribution of power proposed by countries such as [[Germany]] and [[France]]. After signing the treaty in [[Rome]] together with other leaders, he decided to call for a [[referendum]], which was held on 20 February 2005. It was the first referendum on the EU treaty, a fact highly publicized by Zapatero's government. A 'Yes' vote was supported by the Socialist Party and the People's Party and as a result almost 77 percent voted in favour of the European Constitution, but turnout was around 43 percent. However, this result came to nothing when a referendum in France voted to reject the European Constitution which meant that the EU could not ratify the treaty because support was not unanimous.

====Presidency of the Council of the European Union====
On 1 January 2010, Spain assumed the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency]] of the [[European Union]] for the first six months of the 18 month 'Trio' along with [[Belgium]] and [[Hungary]]. The development of the Stockholm Programme Action Plan, the impulse for the EU adhesion to the European Convention on Human Rights, the setting up of the new plan for effective equality between women and men, and the political decision to promote the European protection order, were all important advances achieved under the Spanish Presidency.

Within days, Spain's web site for its Presidency www.eu2010.es was defaced by a picture of the main character of a popular television show, [[Mr. Bean]], the supposed lookalike of Zapatero&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2010/01/04/union_europea/1262634659.html Un error de principiantes permitió el 'ataque' a la web de la presidencia]'' (A beginner's error allowed the attack on the website of the presidency); print title:Mr. Bean inaugura el semestre español (Mr Bean inaugurates the Spanish semester), [[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]], 4 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; although the [[Cross-site scripting|XSS]] attack lasted only several hours.

===France and Germany===

On 1 March 2005, Zapatero became the first Spanish prime minister to speak to the French National Assembly. He supported the PS candidate [[Ségolène Royal]] during her campaign for the [[2007 French presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2007/04/20/videos/1177061368.html |title=Zapatero apoya a Ségolène en Toulouse &amp;#124; elmundo.es videos |publisher=Elmundo.es |date=2007-04-20 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zapatero directly supported the SPD candidate, Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]], before the [[German federal election, 2005|German election of 18 September 2005]].

===Gibraltar===
{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}
While Zapatero complained about [[Gibraltar]]'s celebrations for the tercentenary of British rule and rejected the Gibraltarians' requests for Spain to recognise their right to self-determination, at the end of 2004 his policy changed and he became the first Spanish prime minister to accept the participation of [[Gibraltar]] as a partner on the same level as [[Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in discussions both countries hold regularly concerning the territory. The decision was criticized by many in Spain as a surrender of their claim to sovereignty over Gibraltar as well as an alleged disruption of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. Zapatero said it was a new way to solve a 300-year-old issue.

==2008 election==

'''José María Alfredo Aznar López''' ({{IPA-es|xoˈse maˈɾia aθˈnar|-|Es-José_María_Aznar.ogg}}; born 25 February 1953) served as the [[Prime Minister of Spain]] from 1996 to 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=2004|url=http://www.cidob.org/es/documentacion/biografias_lideres_politicos/europa/espana/jose_maria_aznar_lopez|title=Extended biography at Fundación CIDOB {{es icon}}|publisher=Fundació CIDOB|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Manuel Vázquez Montalbán|MONTALBÁN, M.V.]] ''La Aznaridad'', 4th ed. Mondadori (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; He is on the board of directors of [[News Corporation]].

==Early life==

Aznar, born in [[Madrid]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/Diputados/BusqForm?_piref73_1333155_73_1333154_1333154.next_page=/wc/fichaDiputado&amp;idDiputado=189&amp;idLegislatura=7 Biography at Spanish congress site]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1953, was the son of [[Manuel Aznar Acedo]], army official, journalist and radio broadcaster, and grandson of [[Manuel Aznar Zubigaray]], a prominent journalist during the [[Franco era]]. Both father and grandfather held governmental positions during the years of [[Spain under Franco]]. He studied law at the [[Complutense University of Madrid]], graduating in 1975, becoming a Spanish Tax Authority inspector in 1976.

==Politician==
As a teenager, Aznar was a member of the ''Frente de Estudiantes Sindicalistas'' (FES), a [[Student Union]] supporting the [[Falange]], Franco's one-party [[fascist]] organization. After 1977 it would become ''[[Falange Española Independiente]]'' (FEI).&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.us.archive.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=1969 |url=http://www.archive.org/download/Carta_Aznar_revistaSP_1969/Carta_Aznar_revistaSP_1969.pdf |title=A letter written by Jose María Aznar in 1969 to the editor of a falangist journal |publisher=http://www.us.archive.org/ |accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the death of [[Francisco Franco]] and the restoration of [[Spanish transition to democracy|democracy]], Aznar joined ''[[People's Alliance (Spain)|Alianza Popular]]'' (AP) in January 1979, a few months after his wife. In March he became the Secretary General of the party in [[La Rioja (autonomous community)|La Rioja]], occupying the post until 1980. In February 1981 he joined the AP's National executive committee. He became Assistant Secretary General in February 1982. 

On 26 October 1982 he was elected to the [[Parliament]], representing [[Ávila (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Ávila]]. On 22 June 1985 he was elected to the presidency of the AP in [[Castile and León]]. On 2 December 1986 AP leader [[Manuel Fraga]] resigned following fierce internal party fighting in the aftermath of another failure to dislodge the ruling [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE). Aznar was not considered senior enough to be a possible successor, and gave his support to the more conservative Miguel Herrero, who lost the leadership battle to Fraga's choice, [[Antonio Hernández Mancha]]. As a result, Aznar lost his post as Assistant Secretary General. 

On 10 June 1987, having resigned his parliamentary seat, he was elected to the [[parliament|Cortes]] of [[Castile-León]], where he was elected president of this Autonomous Region. Two years later, Aznar was voted by the National Executive Committee to be the new leader of his party, re-founded as the ''Partido Popular'' ([[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]], or PP).  With Fraga focused on the presidency of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], Aznar was confirmed as leader of the PP at their 10th National Congress at the end of March 1990. In November the PP moved from the Conservative group in the [[European Parliament]] to the more centrist and [[Christian Democrat]]ic [[European People's Party]].  

On 6 June 1993 the PP again lost the general election, but improved on their previous performance by obtaining 34.8% of the vote. The PSOE lost its absolute majority and needed to form a coalition government with other parties in order to continue governing. The result was a disappointment for the PP as the opinion polls had predicted a victory for them.  They did well in the 1994 European and 1995 local elections.

On 19 April 1995, Aznar's armored car prevented him from being assassinated by an [[ETA]] bomb.

The PP won the 3 March 1996 [[Spanish legislative election, 1996|general election]] with 37.6% of the vote, thus ending 13 years of PSOE rule. With 156 of the 350 seats (the PSOE won 141) Aznar had to reach agreements with two regional nationalist parties, [[Convergence and Unity]] (Catalan) and the [[Canary Islands Coalition]], in order to govern with additional support from the [[Basque Nationalist Party]]. He was voted in as President with 181 votes in the [[Cortes Generales]] on 4 May and sworn in the next day by King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]].

==Aznar's terms==
{{ref improve section|date=May 2011}}

===First term (1996–2000)===
The Aznar Government maintained the commitment of the previous government to join the [[Euro|European Union's single currency]] and showed itself willing to take political risks in order to meet the requirements for membership. In the summer of 1996 it announced a decision to freeze the wages of [[civil servants]] in the following year and stood by that decision throughout the fall, despite a series of union-led demonstrations that culminated in protest marches by tens of thousands of Spaniards throughout the nation on 11 December.

The Government, with the backing of regional nationalist parties, passed a strict 1997 budget on 27 December, four days before time would have run out for its approval. The opposition [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]] coalition argued that the spending cuts and tax adjustments contained in the budget would hurt the disadvantaged and benefit the rich. The budget aimed to enable Spain to lower its deficit to below 3% of [[gross domestic product]], a requirement for joining the EU's single currency. Some critics note that this wasn't the only way of doing so.

The Government was also forced to back down on a plan to reduce Spanish dependence on its own high-priced coal when hundreds of coal miners blocked highways and demonstrated in November. The miners persuaded the government to adjust a national electricity plan that would have phased out the subsidy of Spanish coal, making it more expensive than imported coal.

Aznar also announced the sale early in 1997 of the nation's remaining minority stake ([[Golden Share|golden shares]]) in the [[Telefónica]] telecommunications company and the petroleum group [[Repsol YPF|Repsol]]. These golden shares in Telefonica and Repsol YPF, as well as in [[Endesa (Spain)|Endesa]], [[Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria|Argentaria]] and [[Tabacalera]], all presided over by people close to Aznar, have since been declared illegal by the European Union. This marked the beginning of a period of privatizations after the previous PSOE government had nationalized parts of the economy.

After the PP's first year in office, the goodwill between it and the major nationalist parties in the legislature, Convergence and Unity (CiU) and the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), appeared to have lost strength. Both parties had enjoyed leverage over the previous PSOE government, and the PNV in particular stepped back from colluding too closely with the government.

[[Ecological]] issues came to the fore in Spain during 1998. A vigorous public debate created a new awareness of topics such as environmental pollution and deforestation, and a host of organizations competed to spread the ecological message. The Government, conscious of the political implications of this new concern, was also party to the debate and promised active cooperation. As a reaction against attempts to liberalize the current abortion laws, Roman Catholic groups renewed their anti-abortion campaigns.

The economy suffered the effects of the global recession unleashed by the financial crisis in Asia, and the Economic Ministry reduced its 1999 economic growth estimate from 3.9% to 3.7%. The sharp decline in share prices on the Madrid and Barcelona stock exchanges (on average about 20%) created cause for concern among both business associations and trade unions. The latter voiced their concern about the risk of increased [[unemployment]], which remained around 12.5%. Despite this slowdown, salaries increased by an average of 2.3% that year.

In 1999, the [[European Union]] introduced the euro, a major success for Aznar and his government. Steady economic growth and falling unemployment, though the rate exceeded all other EU member states, won the government public support. The Government's credibility was damaged when the PSOE revealed at the end of the year that the ranks of top Spanish civil servants had increased 15% over the previous year despite PP promises to cut the bureaucracy.

===Second term (2000–2004)===
[[Image:Bush, Barroso, Blair, Aznar at Azores.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|[[José Manuel Barroso|Barroso]], [[Tony Blair|Blair]], [[George W. Bush|Bush]], and Aznar in the [[Azores]]]]
Spanish voters reelected Aznar in the [[Spanish general election, 2000|2000 general election]] with an outright majority. The PP obtained 44.5% of the vote and 183 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=2000|url=http://electionresources.org/es/congress.php?election=2000|title=Elections to the Spanish Congress of Deputies - Results Lookup|publisher=Election Resources on the Internet|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish electorate's participation was the lowest for a general election in Spain in the post-Franco era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=2004|url=http://electionresources.org/es/index_en.html|title=Elections to the Spanish Congress of Deputies|publisher=Election Resources on the Internet|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain was one of the fastest-growing economies in the [[European Union]] (EU) in 2001, despite inflation nearing 4% and signs of an economic slowdown.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} However, the government's problems involved politics as much as policies. A number of issues were handled clumsily, including implementation of immigration legislation passed in January and a health scare over low-quality olive oil in July. In the autumn complaints that the government was steamrolling controversial university reforms through the parliament inflamed the opposition. 

At the end of the year, students all over the country joined in strikes, demonstrations, and sit-ins, often alongside their rectors and professors. Though still outperforming most of its EU partners, Spain failed to escape the effects of the global economic downturn in 2002. Falling exports, declining domestic consumption, and a sharp drop in tourist revenue helped bring annual gross domestic product growth down to an estimated 2%, the lowest level since 1996.

In addition, rising crime rates and soaring house prices (up almost 50% since 1998) were the object of widespread public concern, providing opposition parties with powerful ammunition against Aznar's government.

The government ran into even deeper trouble in its attempt to reform the [[unemployment benefit]] system. A controversial decree-law issued on 27 May introduced new restrictions on entitlement to benefits, making it harder for those receiving welfare to turn down jobs offered by the public employment agency, and phasing out the special subsidy for agricultural workers in the south. The trade unions reacted by calling a 24-hour [[general strike]] on 20 June, embarrassing the government on the eve of an EU summit in [[Seville]]. The stoppage proved a largely unexpected success. On 7 October, just two days after a major national demonstration in Madrid to protest against the law, new Labor Minister Eduardo Zaplana announced an abrupt U-turn, accepting nearly all of the unions' demands and leaving only the reform of the subsidy for farm laborers on the statute book.

A major secondary-education bill also proved controversial. Intended to raise educational standards, the proposed Law of Quality lowered the age at which students were streamed into different educational tracks, allowed special schools in the state sector to select on merit, and introduced a new secondary-school-leaving exam. Opposition to the bill's potential socially divisive effects and inadequate funding for the public educational system brought student organizations, trade unions, and left-wing parties into the streets as the bill was being debated in the parliament in October.

Amid the relatively stagnant European economies, estimated GDP growth of 2.3% made Spain the second fastest-growing economy in the European Union in 2003. Continued expansion enabled the Spanish government to proclaim proudly that it would end the year with a budget surplus for the first time in recent history. However; inflation was running at 2.7% (compared with the EU's 1.7%) in November, unemployment stood at more than 10%, almost one-third of the workforce had temporary contracts, and housing prices were spiraling. The European Commission shared analysts' concerns that a hike in interest rates or increased unemployment could send housing prices tumbling, with disastrous consequences for families burdened with unprecedented levels of debt and for the financial institutions that had given them loans.

After six years of relative political calm, when political debate was dominated by a consensus within the ruling party on economics, regional nationalism, and terrorism, several issues arose which polarized Spanish public opinion. Like UK Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], Aznar actively supported the United States' [[War on Terrorism]], despite public opposition. Aznar met with Bush in a private meeting before [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] to discuss the situation of in the UN Security Council. ''[[El País]]'' leaked a [[Bush-Aznar memo|partial transcript of the meeting]]. The government handling of the wreckage of the Greek [[Prestige tanker]] near the Spanish coast, which resulted in a major ecological disaster, also became a divisive issue.

He actively encouraged and supported the Bush administration's foreign policy and the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, defending it on the basis of secret intelligence allegedly containing evidence of the Iraqi government's nuclear proliferation. The majority of the Spanish population, including some PP members, were against the war. Spain's major cities were the scene of the largest street demonstrations ever seen in the country as a result of the government's participation in the invasion. Aznar lost some support from those who had voted for the PP in 2000. On a live TV interview aired on the public station while demonstrations were taking place on the streets, he asked the Spanish people to take his word assuring there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, of which he had evidence. This is now regarded as incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;During a conference in [[Pozuelo de Alarcon]], Madrid, on 8 February 2007 Aznar said there were no [[weapons of mass destruction]] in Iraq prior to the [[Iraq War]], but that when he believed there were WMDs and no one could disprove their existence.{{cite web|author=|year=|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/199655/0/aznar/armas/destruccion/|title=Aznar sabe &quot;ahora&quot; que no había armas de destrucción masiva en Irak|publisher=20 Minutos|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=|url=http://video.google.es/videoplay?docid=-1301991900172521155|title=El ex presidente tarda cuatro años en reconocer la verdad sobre la guerra de Iraq|publisher=Google Video|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=|url=http://www.scp.nl/ess/eventnet/event.asp?id=1442|title=Aznar takes advantage of an act in Madrid with PP loyals to rectify his 2003 accusations about the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq|publisher=European Social Survey|accessdate=2008-01-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071114055843/http://www.scp.nl/ess/eventnet/event.asp?id=1442 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-14}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2004 Aznar called a general election and designated his successor as candidate, [[Mariano Rajoy]], sticking to a pledge of not seeking office for a third term. Despite political tensions, polls suggested that the Popular Party was set to win a third consecutive election on the strength of the economy.
An opinion poll carried out by the government-run CIS (which had estimated that 92% of the Spanish people did not support the War in Iraq) in February 2004 estimated that the PP would win an election with 42.2% of the vote while the PSOE would only get 35.5%.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Madrid train bombings and end of term===
{{Main|2004 Madrid train bombings}}
Three days before the [[Spanish general election, 2004|2004 general election]], 10 bombs killed 191 people in the [[2004 Madrid train bombings|11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings]]. Initially, the government and the opposition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3500452.stm|title=BBC: Scores die in Madrid bomb carnage|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2008-01-03 | date=11 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Juan José Ibarretxe Markuartu]], regional president in the [[Pais Vasco]]: &quot;When ETA attacks, the Basque heart breaks into a thousand pieces.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; stated publicly that it was possible the bombings may have been the work of [[ETA]]. However, the PP government continued to blame ETA even after evidence that the attacks may have been the work of an Islamist group emerged, having the Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Ana Palacio]] instruct all Spanish diplomats to place the blame on ETA at every opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=2004|url=http://www.cadenaser.com/articulo/espana/Exteriores/pidio/todas/embajadas/defendieran/autoria/ETA/csrcsrpor/20040312csrcsrnac_19/Tes/|title=Exteriores pidió a todas las embajadas que defendieran la authoría de ETA|publisher=Cadena Ser|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=|url=http://barcelona.indymedia.org/newswire/display/75859/index.php|title=Palacio ordenó a embajadores decir que ETA cometió los atentados|publisher=Barcelona Independent Media Center|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public perception that the government hid information from the general population gave rise to a public outcry. Two days after the Atocha bombings, demonstrations took place across Spain demanding news from the investigation, where chants such as &quot;We want the truth before we vote&quot; and &quot;Who is responsible?&quot; were heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=2004|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Miles/personas/exigen/calles/espanolas/les/diga/verdad/votar/elpepiesp/20040314elpepinac_7/Tes |title=Miles de personas exigen en las calles españolas que se les diga la verdad antes de votar|publisher=El Pais|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three days after the train bombings, the opposition PSOE won the elections. The subsequent investigations held by a Parliamentary Committee were characterized by bitter partisan exchanges between the different political parties, with dispute over who may have been responsible for the bombings. Aznar appeared before the Committee in November 2004 and declared his belief that the authors of the bombings were not to be found &quot;in faraway deserts or remote mountains.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paloma D. Sotero and Elena Mengual|year=2004|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2004/11/29/espana/1101724074.html|title=Aznar ataca al Gobierno y pide que se 'investigue la verdad' del 11-M|publisher=El Mundo|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aznar said in 2006 that he thought that the attacks were not exclusively perpetrated by Islamists.

==After 2004==
After leaving office on 17 April 2004 he presided over the [[FAES]] [[think tank]], which is associated with the PP. After a 2005 reform, promoted by the current Prime Minister of Spain Rodríguez Zapatero, former prime ministers were admitted into the [[Spanish Council of State]], a position from which he later resigned.

Aznar was appointed Distinguished Scholar in the Practice of Global Leadership at [[Georgetown University]] in Washington, D.C. in April 2004. In this position, he teaches two seminars per semester on contemporary European politics and trans-Atlantic relationships in the [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service]]. Additionally, he teaches a course on political leadership, convened by Professor Carol Lancaster, with former Polish President [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski|Kwasniewski]]. Aznar leads public dialogues on pressing contemporary concerns in collaboration with other members of the faculty; he was awarded an [http://www.newmedia.ufm.edu/gsm/index.php?title=Doctorado_Honor%C3%ADfico_a_Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Aznar honorary degree] at [http://www.ufm.edu Universidad Francisco Marroquin].

In 2007, Aznar was appointed to the advisory board of Centaurus Capital, a London based [[hedge fund]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James Mackintosh|year=2007|url=http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto060120071601098578|title=Centaurus hires high-profile advisers|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; an appointment which proved to be short-lived. In 2008, he was appointed to the [[Board of Directors]] of [[News Corporation]], the media conglomerate of [[Rupert Murdoch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dan Milmo|url=http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,1802922,00.html|title=Former Spanish PM to join Murdoch board|publisher=Guardian Business|accessdate=2008-01-03 | location=London | date=22 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also member of the European Advisory Panel of The [[European Business Awards]] and the [[European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation]].

Aznar is a member of the [[Club of Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clubmadrid.org The Club of Madrid] is an independent non-profit organization composed of 81 democratic former Presidents and Prime Ministers from 57 different countries. It constitutes the world´s largest forum of former Heads of State and Government, who have come together to respond to a growing demand for support among leaders in democratic leadership, governance, crisis and post-crisis situations. All lines of work share the common goal of building functional and inclusive societies, where the leadership experience of our Members is most valuable.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a Member of the [[Global Leadership Foundation]], an organization which works to promote good governance around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.g-l-f.org/pagebuilder.asp?id=239 Welcome to GLF Global Leadership Foundation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aznar was also one of the signatories and promoters of the [[Prague Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Support the Prague Charter |url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=64507 |newspaper=Jerusalem Post |date=June 11, 2007 |accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 founded the [[Friends of Israel Initiative]].

==Environmental Views==
In October 2008, on the occasion of a visit by the Czech President [[Václav Klaus]] to the Spanish capital, Aznar said that anthropogenic climate change is not a real phenomenon, but only a ‘scientifically questionable’ theory which had become the new religion, the followers of which were the ‘enemies of freedom’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.france24.com/en/20081023-aznar-questions-global-warming-spain-environment Aznar questions global warming], [[France 24]]&lt;/ref&gt;
These views were similar to those expressed by Klaus in his book &quot;Blue Planet in Green Shackles&quot;, which was published in Spanish by [[FAES]].&lt;ref&gt;The book was originally published in 2007 in Czech (''Modrá, nikoli zelená planeta''): the Spanish title is [http://www.fundacionfaes.org/en/documentos/gotagota/show/00786 ''Planeta azul (no verde)''].&lt;/ref&gt; Aznar's speech caused some puzzlement, as his government had been a signatory to the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in 1998, and it appeared that he had subsequently changed his mind about climate change.

The Partido Popular distanced itself from the current environmental views of its former leader, classing him among a &quot;sceptical minority&quot; within its membership, although there was support from Esperanza Aguirre who said that she and Aznar were in favour of a debate about climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/madrid/Aguirre/defiende/tala/pesca/caza/parques/naturales/elpepiespmad/20081107elpmad_4/Tes La presidenta respalda a Aznar sobre el cambio climático]
[[El País]]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009 Aznar was due to speak to a [[International Conference on Climate Change|Heartland Institute conference]] which was billed as the &quot;world's largest-ever gathering of global warming skeptics&quot;. He withdrew at short notice, and in the absence of a public explanation there was speculation that he did so in order to spare his party embarrassment.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Ansede (03 March 2009) [http://www.publico.es/ciencias/205836/aznar/borra/cumbre/negacionista/cambio/climatico &quot;Aznar borra cumbre negacionista&quot;], [[Público (Spain)|''Público'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 it was reported that Aznar would chair the Advisory Council of the Global Adaptation Institute, a new body concerned with [[adaptation to climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.GlobalAdaptationInstitute.org Global Adaptation Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on Israel==

In 2010, Aznar founded the [[Friends of Israel Initiative]], with the stated goal to &quot;counter the attempts to delegitimize the State of Israel and its right to live in peace within safe and defensible borders&quot;. Referring to the ill-fated takeover of the [[Mavi Marmara]] by Israeli commandos, Aznar said in 2010 that the world must support Israel because &quot;if it goes down, we all go down&quot;. He said that &quot;In an ideal world, the assault by Israeli commandos on the 'Mavi Marmara' would not have ended up with nine dead and a score wounded. In an ideal world, the soldiers would have been peacefully welcomed on to the ship.&quot; He criticized Turkey, for placing Israel &quot;in an impossible situation&quot; in which it would have to either give up its security or face world condemnation. Aznar concluded that Israel is the West's first line of defense, and must be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-Spain PM: If Israel goes down, we all go down|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3906657,00.html|accessdate=20 June 2010|newspaper=Ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Aznar's government posthumously granted a medal of Civil Merit to [[Melitón Manzanas]], the head of the [[secret police]] in [[San Sebastián]] and the first high-profile member of the Francoist government killed by [[ETA]] in 1968. Manzanas was widely considered a [[torturer]], and [[Amnesty International]] condemned the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=30 January 2001 | title=No deben tolerarse las recompensas a torturadores(They should not tolerate rewards to torturers) | publisher=Amnesty International | url=http://www.es.amnesty.org/com/2001/com_30ene01b.shtm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2004 elections it was revealed that Aznar and his government secretly channeled public funds to a United States legal firm to lobby for the bestowment of the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] on Aznar. The contract consisted in a first payment of $700,000 [[USD]] for the first seven months, followed by $100,000 monthly payments until it reached the sum of $2 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cadenaser.com/articulo/espana/Aznar/pago/dinero/publico/lobby/Washington/conseguir/medalla/Congreso/EEUU/csrcsrpor/20040722csrcsrnac_6/Tes/ Aznar pagó con dinero público a un &quot;lobby&quot; de Washington para conseguir la medalla del Congreso de EEUU (Cadena SER)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with BBC World on 27 July 2006 he voiced doubts about &quot;Islamists&quot; being the sole culprits of the disputed [[11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings]], &quot;You know in this moment some perpetrators of the attacks, but you do not know who imagined the attack, who is the leader of the attack, who is the idea (sic) of the attack, who established and supported means for the attacks, who defined the logistics of the attacks, who established the strategies of the attack. Nothing...I think that one part of the perpetrators are Islamists, but I think that this is not only an Islamist attack.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=2006|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqLGnyZ_ES4&amp;mode=related&amp;search=|title=Entrevista BBC Aznar, 24-07-2006 (Parte II de 3)|publisher=BBC World via YouTube|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a Washington, D.C. conference at the [[Hudson Institute]], a [[conservative]] U.S. [[think tank]], on 23 September 2006, referring to [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s [[Pope Benedict XVI Islam controversy|comments]] on [[Islam]] and violence, Aznar asked why Muslims had not apologized for occupying Spain for 800 years as [[Al-Andalus]]. He then called the [[Alliance of Civilizations]] initiative &quot;stupid.&quot; His reference to apologies was a response to the demonstrations asking the Pope to apologize. One [[People's Party (Spain)|PP]] official clarified Aznar's speech by saying the Prime Minister thought it is pointless to apologize for historical events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=|url=http://www.eitb24.com/portal/eitb24/noticia/en/politics/former-spanish-president-aznar-ldquomuslims-should-apologize-for-?itemId=B24_11616&amp;cl=%2Feitb24%2Fpolitica&amp;idioma=en|title=Aznar: &quot;Muslims should apologize for occupying Spain for 800 years&quot;|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/09/22/internacional/1158945858.html|title=Aznar se pregunta por qué los musulmanes no se disculpan 'por haber ocupado España ocho siglos'|publisher=El Mundo|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1977 he married [[Ana Botella]], by whom he had three children: José María Aznar Botella, Ana Aznar Botella, born on 26 September 1981, and Alonso Aznar Botella.

Aznar is a grandfather. His daughter married at [[El Escorial]] on 5 September 2002 [[Alejandro Agag]], with whom she has four children, Alejandro (b. [[Madrid]], 4 June 2004), Rodrigo (b. [[Madrid]], 13 December 2005), Pelayo (b. [[Madrid]], 16 January 2008), and Alonso (b. [[Madrid]], 22 December 2010) Agag y Aznar.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geneall.net/H/per_page.php?id=467812&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 in response to persistent rumours, Aznar denied being the father of Zohra Dati, daughter of Ms [[Rachida Dati]], the then French Minister for Justice.&lt;ref&gt;([http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5478459.ece Return of 'Supermum' Rachida Dati, starts maternity leave row], ''Times Online'' Retrieved on 9 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juan Carlos I''' ({{IPA-es|ˈxwaŋ ˈkarlos}}, baptized as ''Juan Carlos Alfonso Víctor María de Borbón y Borbón-Dos Sicilias'' and born 5 January 1938) is the reigning [[List of Spanish monarchs|King of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt; His name, while rarely [[Anglicisation|anglicised]], is rendered as ''John Charles Alphonse Victor Mary of Bourbon and Bourbon-Two Sicilies''. He was given these baptismal names after his father (Juan de Borbón), grandfather (Alfonso XIII) and maternal grandfather (Prince Charles of Bourbon-Two Sicilies).&lt;/ref&gt; He is a direct descendant through the male line of [[Robert of Hesbaye]] (770-807), currently making the Spanish Royal Line one of the longest lived in the world, second only to the Japanese.

On 22 November 1975, two days after [[Francisco Franco|General Franco's]] death, Juan Carlos was designated king according to the law of succession promulgated by Franco. Spain had no monarch for 38 years in 1969 when Franco named Juan Carlos as the next head of state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10C14F83D591A7493C6A8178AD95F458785F9&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=akihito%20%20and%20Windsor&amp;st=cse  &quot;Those Apprentice Kings and Queens Who May – One Day – Ascend a Throne,&quot;] ''New York Times.'' 14 November 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]], voted in [[referendum]], acknowledges him expressly as King of Spain. The Spanish Constitution, Title II: the Crown, Article 56, Subsection 1, affirms the role of the Spanish monarch as the [[personify|personification and embodiment]] of the [[Spanish people|Spanish nation]], a symbol of Spain's enduring unity and permanence; and as such, the monarch is the [[head-of-state]] and [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Spanish Armed Forces]] in a system known in Spanish as ''[[Constitutional monarchy|monarquía parlamentaria]]'' (constitutional monarchy).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiki Source Spa Constitution 78&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Title II&quot;&gt;Title II, Article 56, Subsection 1, Text: &lt;br /&gt;''The King is Head of State, the symbol of its unity and permanence. He arbitrates and moderates the regular functioning of the institutions, assumes the highest representation of the Spanish State in international relations, especially with the nations of its historical community, and exercises the functions expressly conferred on him by the Constitution and the laws''&lt;br /&gt;''El Rey es el Jefe del Estado, símbolo de su unidad y permanencia, arbitra y modera el funcionamiento regular de las instituciones, asume la más alta representación del Estado español en las relaciones internacionales, especialmente con las naciones de su comunidad histórica, y ejerce las funciones que le atribuyen expresamente la Constitución y las leyes''&lt;/ref&gt; 

King Juan Carlos successfully oversaw the [[Spanish transition to democracy|transition of Spain]] from dictatorship to [[parliamentary monarchy]].

Juan Carlos married [[Queen Sofía of Spain|Sophia of Greece and Denmark]] in 1962. The couple have three children and eight grandchildren.

Polls from 2000 show that he is widely approved of by Spaniards.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.elpais.com/especiales/2000/rey/rey.swf Los españoles de hoy y el franquismo], (&quot;The Spaniards of today and Francoism&quot;), ''[[El País]]'', undated[[Adobe Shockwave]] file, part of [http://www.elpais.com/especiales/2000/rey/ Un rey para una democracia], 2000. Accessed online 29 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Spanish Constitution, the monarch is also instrumental in promoting [[Ibero-America]]n relations, the &quot;nations of its historical community&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiki Source Spa Constitution 78&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Title II&quot;/&gt; In this capacity, the King of Spain serves as the president of the [[Ibero-American States Organization]], representing over 700,000,000 people in 24 member nations worldwide. In 2008 he was considered the most popular leader in all [[Ibero-America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2008/07/09/internacional/1215635605.html Juan Carlos most popular leader in Ibero-America (spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Juan Carlos of Spain was born to the [[Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona]], and the [[Princess María Mercedes of Bourbon-Two Sicilies]] in [[Rome]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]], where his grandfather, King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]], and other members of the Spanish [[royal family]] had settled following the proclamation of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] in 1931. His early life was dictated largely by the political concerns of his father and General Franco. He moved to Spain in 1948 to be [[education|educated]] there after his father persuaded Franco to allow it. He began his studies in [[San Sebastián]] and finished them in 1954 at the [[San Isidro Institute]] in Madrid. He then joined the army, doing his officer training from 1955 to 1957 at the [[Military academy|Military Academy]] of Zaragoza.

Juan Carlos has two sisters and one brother: [[Infanta Pilar, Duchess of Badajoz]] (born 1936), and [[Infanta Margarita, Duchess of Soria]] (born 1939) and his younger brother [[Infante Alfonso of Spain|Alfonso]].

In March 1956, Juan Carlos's younger brother Alfonso died in a gun accident at the family's home Villa Giralda in [[Estoril]], Portugal. The Spanish Embassy in Portugal issued an official communiqué:&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Paul Preston]], ''Juan Carlos: Steering Spain from Dictatorship to Democracy'' (New York: [[W. W. Norton|W.W. Norton]], 2004), 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

: Whilst [[Highness|His Highness]] Prince Alfonso was cleaning a revolver last evening with his brother, a shot was fired hitting his forehead and killing him in a few minutes. The accident took place at 20.30 hours, after the Infante's return from the [[Maundy Thursday]] religious service, during which he had received [[Eucharist|holy communion]].

Very quickly, however, rumours appeared in newspapers that the gun had actually been held by Juan Carlos at the moment the shot was fired. Josefina Carolo, dressmaker to Juan Carlos's mother, said that Juan Carlos pointed the pistol at Alfonso and pulled the trigger, unaware that the pistol was loaded. Bernardo Arnoso, a Portuguese friend of Juan Carlos, also said that Juan Carlos fired the pistol not knowing that it was loaded, and adding that the bullet ricocheted off a wall hitting Alfonso in the face. Helena Matheopoulos, a Greek author who spoke with Juan Carlos's sister [[Infanta Pilar, Duchess of Badajoz|Pilar]], said that Alfonso had been out of the room and when he returned and pushed the door open, the door knocked Juan Carlos in the arm causing him to fire the pistol.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 Juan Carlos spent a year in the [[Spanish Navy (Armada Española)|naval]] school at [[Marín, Pontevedra|Marin]], [[Pontevedra]], and another in the [[Spanish Air Force|Air Force]] school in [[San Javier, Murcia|San Javier]] in [[Murcia]]. In 1960–1 he studied Law, International Political Economy and Public Finance at [[Complutense University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casareal.es/sm_rey/index-ides-idweb.html Su Majestad el Rey Don Juan Carlos], Página oficial de la Casa de Su Majestad el Re, retrieved 16 September 2011 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then went to live in the [[Palace of Zarzuela]], and began carrying out official engagements.

==Prince of Spain, 1969–1975==
The dictatorial regime of [[Francisco Franco]] had come to power during the [[Spanish Civil War]], which had pitted democrats, anarchists, socialists, and communists, supported in part by the [[Soviet Union]] and by international volunteers, against conservatives, monarchists, nationalists, and fascists, with the latter group ultimately emerging successful with the support of neighbouring Portugal and the major European [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]] of [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]]. Despite his alliance with monarchists, Franco was not eager to restore the deposed Spanish monarchy once in power, preferring to head a regime with himself as [[head of state]] for life. Though Franco's partisan supporters generally accepted this arrangement for the present, much debate quickly ensued over who would replace Franco upon his death. The far right factions demanded the return of a hardline [[absolute monarchy]], and eventually Franco agreed that his successor would be a monarch. Franco, a Carlist by some accounts, had no intention of restoring the constitutional form of monarchy known during the 19th century or [[Republic|the republican form of government]] created by the [[Spanish Constitution of 1931]].

The heir to the throne of Spain was [[Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona|Juan de Borbón]] ''(Count of Barcelona)'', the son of the late [[Alfonso XIII]]. However, General Franco viewed the heir with extreme suspicion, believing him to be a liberal who was opposed to his regime. In 1961, Franco offered the crown to [[Otto von Habsburg|Archduke Otto of Austria]], but he declined on account of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg dynasty]]'s long absence from the Spanish throne, and recommended Juan Carlos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/07/04/general-eu-germany-obit-habsburg_8548589.html|title=Otto von Habsburg who saw end of empire dead at 98|work=Forbes|accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Franco then considered giving the Spanish throne to Juan Carlos's cousin [[Alfonso, Duke of Anjou and Cádiz]].  Alfonso was known to be an ardent Francoist and would marry Franco's granddaughter, Doña [[María del Carmen Martínez-Bordiú y Franco]] in 1972. In response, Juan Carlos started to use his second name ''[[Charles|Carlos]]'' to assert his claim to the heritage of the [[Carlist]] branch of his family.

Ultimately, Franco decided to skip a generation and name Juan de Borbón's son, Prince Juan Carlos, as his personal successor. Franco hoped the young prince could be groomed to take over the nation while still maintaining the ultraconservative nature of his regime. In 1969, Juan Carlos was officially designated heir-apparent and was given the new title of Prince of Spain (not the traditional [[Prince of Asturias]]).  As a condition of being named heir-apparent, he had to swear loyalty to Franco's [[Movimiento Nacional]], which he did with little outward hesitation.

Prince Juan Carlos met and consulted Franco many times while [[heir apparent]] and often took part in official and ceremonial state functions standing alongside the dictator, much to the anger of hardline republicans and more moderate liberals, who had hoped that Franco's death would bring in an era of reform. During 1969–1975, Juan Carlos publicly supported Franco's regime. Although Franco's health worsened during those years, whenever he did appear in public, from state dinners to military parades, it was in Juan Carlos's company as he continued to praise Franco and his government for the economic growth and positive changes in Spain. However, as the years progressed, Juan Carlos began meeting secretly with [[political opposition]] leaders and exiles, who were fighting to bring liberal reform to the country. He also had secret conversations with his father over the telephone. Franco, for his part, remained largely oblivious to the prince's actions and denied allegations from his ministers and advisors that Juan Carlos was in any way disloyal to his vision of the regime.

During periods of Franco's temporary incapacity in 1974 and 1975 Juan Carlos was [[acting (law)|acting]] head of state. Near death, on 30 October 1975, Franco gave full control to Juan Carlos. On 22 November, following Franco's death, the [[Cortes Generales]] proclaimed Juan Carlos King of Spain and on 27 November, Juan Carlos was anointed king in a ceremony called ''Holy Spirit Mass'', which was the equivalent of a [[coronation]], at the [[San Jerónimo el Real|Jerónimos Church]] in Madrid.

==Restoration of the monarchy==
[[File:King Juan Carlos I Royal Trips.PNG|thumb|right|Royal trips of King Juan Carlos I from 1975 until today.]]

Juan Carlos quickly instituted reforms, to the great displeasure of [[Falangist]] and conservative ([[monarchist]]) elements, especially in the military, who had expected him to maintain the authoritarian state. He appointed [[Adolfo Suárez]], a former leader of the [[Movimiento Nacional (Spain)|Movimiento Nacional]], as [[President of the Government of Spain|Prime Minister of Spain]].

[[Image:Nicolae e Juan Carlos.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Juan Carlos greeting [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], [[President of Romania]], during his visit to Spain in 1979]]
On 20 May 1977, the leader of the only recently legalized [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) [[Felipe González]], accompanied by [[Javier Solana]], visited Juan Carlos in the Zarzuela Palace. The event represented a key endorsement of the monarchy from Spain's [[Left-wing politics|political left]], who had been historically [[republicanism|republican]]. Left-wing support for the monarchy grew when the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] was legalized shortly thereafter, a move Juan Carlos had pressed for, despite enormous right-wing military opposition at that time, during the [[Cold War]].

On 15 June 1977, Spain held its first post-Franco democratic elections. In 1978, a new [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Constitution]] was promulgated that acknowledged Juan Carlos as rightful heir of the Spanish [[dynasty]] and King; specifically, Title II, Section 57 asserted Juan Carlos' right to the throne of Spain by dynastic succession in the Borbón tradition, as &quot;the legitimate heir of the historic dynasty&quot; rather than as the designated successor of Franco.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiki Source Spa Constitution 78&quot;&gt;[http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Constituci%C3%B3n_espa%C3%B1ola_de_1978:_04 Título II. De la Corona, Wikisource]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Title II, Section 57, Subsection 1: &lt;br /&gt; ''&quot;The Crown shall be inherited by the successors of H.M. Juan Carlos I de Borbón, the legitimae heir of the historic dynasty.&quot;'' &lt;br /&gt; ''&quot;La Corona de España es hereditaria en los sucesores de S. M. Don Juan Carlos I de Borbón, legítimo heredero de la dinastía histórica.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution was passed by the democratically elected [[Constituent Cortes]], ratified by the people in a referendum (6 December) and then signed into law by the King before a solemn meeting of the Cortes.

Further legitimacy had been restored to Juan Carlos' position on 14 May 1977, when his father, Don Juan (whom many monarchists had recognized as the legitimate, exiled King of Spain during the [[Spain under Franco|Franco era]]), formally renounced his claim to the Throne and recognized his son as the sole head of the Spanish [[Royal House]], transferring to him the historical heritage of the Spanish monarchy, thus making Juan Carlos both the ''de facto'' and the ''[[de jure]]'' (rightful) King in the eyes of the traditional monarchists. Juan Carlos, who had already been King since Franco's death, gave an acceptance address after his father's [[resignation speech]] and thanked him by confirming the title of [[List of Counts of Barcelona|Count of Barcelona]] that Don Juan had assumed in exile.
It was a sovereign title associated to the crown.

An attempted military coup, known as [[23-F]], occurred on 23 February 1981, when the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] were seized by members of the [[Guardia Civil]] in the [[Chambers of parliament|parliamentary chamber]]. Believed to be a major factor in foiling the coup was the public [[Broadcasting|television broadcast]] by the king, calling for unambiguous support for the legitimate [[Democracy|democratic government]]. Certainly, in the hours before his speech, he had personally called many senior military figures to tell them that he was opposed to the coup and that they had to defend the democratic government.&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:SelloJuanCarlosI.jpg|right|thumb|130px|Current Spanish [[Correos]] stamp depicting King Juan Carlos I.]] --&gt;

When Juan Carlos became king, [[Communist Party of Spain|Communist]] leader [[Santiago Carrillo]] nicknamed him ''Juan Carlos the Brief'', predicting that the monarchy would soon be swept away with the other remnants of the Franco era. After the collapse of the attempted coup mentioned above, however, in an emotional statement, Carrillo told television viewers: &quot;God save the king.&quot; The Communist leader also remarked: &quot;Today, we are all monarchists.&quot; If public support for the monarchy among democrats and leftists before 1981 had been limited, following the king's handling of the coup, it became significantly greater. According to a poll in the newspaper ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'' in November 2005, 77.5% of Spaniards thought Juan Carlos was &quot;good or very good&quot;, 15.4% &quot;not so good&quot;, and only 7.1% &quot;bad or very bad&quot;. Even so, the issue of the monarchy re-emerged on 28 September 2007 as photos of the king were burnt in public in [[Catalonia]] by small groups of protesters wanting the restoration of the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://eux.tv/article.aspx?articleId=15269 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081201063734/http://eux.tv/article.aspx?articleId=15269 |archivedate=1 December 2008 |title=Spanish royals worried about protests against monarchy |publisher=EUX.TV |last=Tarvainen |first=Sinikka |date=28 September 2007 |accessdate=29 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2000, Juan Carlos was the target of an enraged protester when [[Juan María Fernández y Krohn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.gva.be/dossiers/-k/koningshuis/actua2000/actua147.asp |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080317085858/http://www.gva.be/dossiers/-k/koningshuis/actua2000/actua147.asp |archivedate=17 March 2008 |title='Belager' koning Albert komt er goedkoop vanaf |last=Cardyn |first=Hans |publisher=Gazet Van Antwerpen|accessdate=29 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had previously tried to take the life of [[Pope John Paul II]], began shouting &quot;Murderer! Murderer!&quot; at the king and then approached him in a very threatening manner.

==Role in contemporary Spanish politics==
The election of socialist leader [[Felipe González]] to the Spanish prime ministership in 1982 marked the effective end of the King's active involvement in Spanish politics. González would govern for over a decade, and his administration helped consolidate the democratic gains and thus maintained the stability of the nation. While the king is generally reckoned as having a merely ceremonial role in politics, he commands great moral authority as an essential symbol of the country's unity.

[[File:5000pelas.JPG|right|center|thumb|400px|5000 [[Spanish peseta]] note with image of King Juan Carlos.]]

Under the constitution, the King has immunity from prosecution in matters relating to his official duties. This is so because every act of the King as such (and not as a citizen) needs to be undersigned by a government official, thus making the undersigner responsible instead of the king.
The honour of the Royal Family is specially protected from offences by the [[Spanish Penal Code]].
Under this protection, Basque independentist [[Arnaldo Otegi]]&lt;ref name=BBCslander&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4407134.stm Basque convicted for king insult], ''[[BBC News]]'', 4 November 2005. Accessed online 29 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and cartoonists from ''[[El Jueves]]'' were tried and punished.

The King gives an annual speech to the nation on Christmas Eve. He is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the Spanish armed forces.

When the media asked Juan Carlos in 2005 if he would endorse the bill legalising [[Same-sex marriage in Spain|gay marriage]] that was then being debated in the ''Cortes Generales'', he answered ''&quot;Soy el Rey de España y no el de Bélgica&quot;'' (&quot;I am the King of Spain, not of Belgium&quot;){{ndash}} a reference to King [[Baudouin of Belgium|Baudouin I of Belgium]], who refused to sign the Belgian law legalising abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Es icon}} {{cite news |title=Don Juan Carlos, sobre el matrimonio gay: 'Soy el Rey de España y no el de Bélgica' |publisher=El Mundo|date=13 May 2006|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/05/12/espana/1115917538.html |accessdate=8 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The King gave his [[Royal Assent]] to Law 13/2005 on 1 July 2005; the law legalising gay marriage was [[gazette]]d in the ''[[Boletín Oficial del Estado]]'' on 2 July, and came into effect on 3 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{Es icon}} {{cite web|title=Disposiciones Generales |publisher=Boletin Oficial del Estado|date=2 June 2005 |url=http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2005/07/02/pdfs/A23632-23634.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=8 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007 at the [[Ibero-American Summit]] in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago de Chile]], during a heated exchange, Juan Carlos interrupted  [[List of Presidents of Venezuela|Venezuelan President]] [[Hugo Chávez]] and asked him, &quot;''[[¿Por qué no te callas?]]''&quot; (&quot;Why don't you shut up?&quot; using the familiar &quot;tu&quot; you form to underline the disdain). Chávez had been interrupting the Spanish Prime Minister, [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]], while the latter was defending his predecessor and political opponent, [[José María Aznar]], after Chávez had referred to Aznar as a fascist and &quot;less human than snakes&quot;.  The King shortly afterwards left the hall when President [[Daniel Ortega]] of [[Nicaragua]] accused Spain of intervention in his country's elections and complained about some Spanish energy companies working in Nicaragua.&lt;ref name=&quot;antena3-20071111&quot;&gt;{{Es icon}} {{Cite web|url=http://www.antena3.com/a3noticias/servlet/Noticias?destino=../a3n/noticia/noticia.jsp&amp;sidicom=si&amp;id=13286798| title=El Rey Don Juan Carlos a Hugo Chávez: &quot;¿Por qué no te callas?&quot;|accessdate=11 November 2007|publisher=[[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]]|date=11 November 2007}} (&quot;King Juan Carlos to Hugo Chávez: 'Why don't you shut up?'&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;  This was an unprecedented diplomatic incident and a rare display of public anger by the King.&lt;ref&gt;{{Es icon}} {{cite news|url=http://www.elperiodico.com/default.asp?idpublicacio_PK=46&amp;idioma=CAS&amp;idnoticia_PK=457570&amp;idseccio_PK=1007| title= Nunca se había visto al Rey tan enfadado en público|date=10 November 2007|accessdate=10 November 2007}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}} (&quot;Never has the King been seen so angry in public&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and private life==

Juan Carlos was married in [[Athens]] at the Church of Saint Dennis on 14 May 1962, to HRH [[Queen Sofía of Spain|Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark]], daughter of [[Paul of Greece|King Paul]]. She was [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] but converted to Roman Catholicism in order to become Spain's queen. Also in 1962, a Roman Catholic wedding was performed in the Pauline Chapel the [[Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome.

They have two daughters and a son.

In 1972, Juan Carlos, a keen sailor, competed in the [[Dragon (keelboat)|Dragon class]] event at the [[1972 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]], finishing [[Sailing at the 1972 Summer Olympics – Dragon|15th]]. In their [[summer holiday]]s, the whole family meets in [[Marivent]] Palace ([[Palma de Mallorca]]) and the [[Fortuna (yacht)|Fortuna]] yacht, where they take part in sailing competitions. The king has manned the [[Bribón]] series of yachts. In winter, they usually go [[skiing]] in [[Baqueira-Beret]] and [[Candanchú]] ([[Pyrenees]]), where the king has occasionally ended with a broken leg.

Juan Carlos also enjoys [[bear hunting]]. In October 2004, he angered [[Environmentalism|environmental activists]] by killing nine bears (of which one was a pregnant female) in central Romania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/01/23729b67-d43a-4711-89aa-afef9326c53c.html Romania: Elite Hunting Spree Sparks Calls For Better Animal Protection], ''[[RFE/RL]]'', 27 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2006, it is alleged that Juan Carlos shot a drunken tame bear (Mitrofan) during a private hunting trip to Russia. The Office of the Spanish Monarchy denies this claim, which was made by the Russian regional authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6070656.stm &quot;Royal row over Russian bear fate&quot;], ''[[BBC]]'', 20 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Juan Carlos and Sophia are fluent in several languages. They both speak Spanish, English, and French. The king also speaks fluent Italian and Catalan. Unlike the queen, Juan Carlos does not speak any German, nor her native language, Greek, a fact he regrets.

Juan Carlos is an [[amateur radio operator]] and holds the call sign EA0JC.
His fondness of [[wiktionary:incognito|incognito]] motorbike riding has raised [[urban legend]]s of people finding him on lonely roads. For example, one story says that a biker out of petrol stranded on a hot sunny day was assisted by a fellow motorcyclist, who returned with a small container of petrol. The good-Samaritan, on removing his helmet, turned out to be Juan Carlos.

Juan Carlos is member of the [[World Scout Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Einladung zun Pressegespräch am 18.September-World Scout Foundation in Österreich-Seine Mäjestät Carl XVI von Schweden zu Gast in Wien|url=http://www.ppoe.at/presse/pdf/wsf_pressegespraech.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate =14 September 2008|language=German|publisher=Pfadfinder und Pfadfinderinnen Österreichs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His net worth is only valued at $5 million, but the Royal Family have a net worth over $1.7 billion (December 2011).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalinsight.net/content/spanish-monarchy-frequently-asked-questions&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sueddeutsche.de/geld/bildstrecke-fuerstliches-vermoegen-1.234309-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==

A benign tumour was removed from King Juan Carlos’ lung in an operation carried out in the &quot;Hospital Clínic&quot; of Barcelona on Saturday 8 May 2010. The 72-year-old Monarch was expected to be allowed home in three or four days, and able to renew full physical activity in a fortnight. The operation came as a result of the King’s latest annual check-up, and doctors said the procedure went well and Juan Carlos would not need any further follow-up treatment. At a press convention the operating team said that the 17-19mm tumour which had been removed under a general anaesthetic from the right lung contained no malignant cells. ‘This is good news’, said doctor Laureano Molins, who had directed the operation.

== Budget of the royal house ==

In the wake of the [[Iñaki Urdangarin, Duke of Palma de Mallorca|Urdangarin]] affair (the husband of his daughter is accused of corruption), the King decided in 2011 to detail the yearly royal budget of 8.3 millions euros for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;politica.elpais.com&quot;&gt;http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2011/12/28/actualidad/1325105881_885673.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.casareal.es/noticias/news/20111228_desglose_presupuestario-ides-idweb.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, some spending such as the electricity bill are not included in the 8.3 budget since they are paid by the State.&lt;ref name=&quot;politica.elpais.com&quot;/&gt;

==Titles, styles, honours and arms==
===Titles===
{{Main|List of titles and honours of Juan Carlos I of Spain|List of titles and honours of the Spanish Crown}}

The current [[Constitution of Spain|Spanish constitution]] refers to the monarchy as &quot;the Crown of Spain&quot; and the constitutional title of the monarch is simply ''Rey/Reina de España'': that is, &quot;king/queen of Spain&quot;. However, the constitution allows for the use of other historic titles pertaining to the Spanish monarchy, without specifying them. A decree promulgated 6 November 1987 at the Council of Ministers regulates the titles further, and on that basis the monarch of Spain has a right to use (&quot;may use&quot;) those other titles appertaining to the Crown. Contrary to some belief, the long titulary that contains the list of over 20 kingdoms, etc., is not in state use, nor is it used in Spanish diplomacy. In fact, it has never been in use in that form, as &quot;Spain&quot; was never a part of the list in pre-1837 era when the long list was officially used.

This feudal style was last used officially in 1836, in the [[Isabella II of Spain#Titulary|titulary]] of [[Isabella II of Spain]] before she became constitutional Queen.

Juan Carlos's titles include that of [[Kings of Jerusalem|King of Jerusalem]], as successor to the royal family of [[Naples]].

Juan Carlos' patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son.

[[Patrilineal descent]] is the principle behind membership in royal houses, as it can be traced back through the generations, which means that Juan Carlos I is a member of the [[House of Bourbon]], the senior-surviving cadet branch of the [[Capetian dynasty]].

'''León''' is one of the 52 electoral districts ({{lang-es|circunscripciones}}) used for the [[Spanish Congress of Deputies|Congress of Deputies]], the lower chamber of the [[Spain|Spanish]] Parliament, the [[Cortes Generales]]. It was first contested in modern times in the [[Spanish general election, 1977|1977 General Election]].  Notable former deputies include the current [[Prime Minister of Spain]] [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]]. 

==Boundaries and electoral system==
Under Article 68 of the Spanish constitution &lt;ref name=&quot;Spanish Constitution&quot;&gt;[http://www.mir.es/DGPI/Normativa/Normativa_Estatal/Constitucion_Espanola/constitucion_espanola.html Spanish Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt;
the boundaries must be the same as the [[León (province)|province of León]] and under Article 140 this can only be altered with the approval of congress. Voting is on the basis of [[universal suffrage]] in a [[secret ballot]]. The electoral system used is [[closed list]] [[proportional representation]] with seats allocated using the [[D'Hondt method]]. Only lists which poll 3% or more of all valid votes cast, including votes &quot;en blanco&quot; i.e. for &quot;none of the above&quot; can be considered for seats. Under article 12 of the constitution, the minimum voting age is 18.

[[León, Spain|León]] is the largest city with 108,000 voters, just over one-quarter of the total electorate of 414,000 on 1 May 2008,&lt;ref name=&quot;Electorates by municipality 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ine.es/censoe/censo_cerrado/cermun_08.xls|title= Number of voters by municipality 2008 |publisher=Spanish census office|accessdate=2009-04-11}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the next largest municipalities being [[Ponferrada]] (54,000 voters), [[San Andrés del Rabanedo]] (24,000) and [[Villaquilambre]] (12,000). There were no other municipalities with more than 10,000 voters.

{{PoliticsES}}

==Eligibility==
Article 67.3 of the Spanish Constitution prohibits dual membership of the Cortes and regional assemblies, meaning that candidates must resign from Regional Assemblies if elected. Article 70 also makes active judges, magistrates, public defenders, serving military personnel, active police officers and members of constitutional and electoral tribunals ineligible. &lt;ref name=&quot;Spanish Constitution&quot;/&gt;

==Number of members==
In the general elections of [[Spanish general election, 1977|1977]], [[Spanish general election, 1979|1979]] and [[Spanish general election, 1982|1982]] León returned 6 members. That figure was reduced to 5 members for the [[Spanish general election, 1986|1986 election]] and it has stayed at that figure since then.

Under Spanish electoral law, all provinces are entitled to a minimum of 2 seats with a remaining 248 seats apportioned according to population. &lt;ref&gt;[http://electionresources.org/es/index_en.html General features of Spanish electoral system]&lt;/ref&gt; These laws are laid out in detail in the 1985 electoral law. (Ley Orgánica del Régimen Electoral General) The practical effect of this law has been to overrepresent smaller provinces at the expense of larger provinces.

In 2004 Spain had 34,571,831 voters giving an average of 98,777 voters per deputy &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionresources.org/es/congress.php?election=2004 2004 Spanish election]&lt;/ref&gt;. In León the ratio was slightly below that at 90,556.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionresources.org/es/congress.php?election=2004&amp;province=24 Leon 2004 election results]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the general elections of 1977, 1979 and 1982 Madrid returned 32 members. That figure was increased to 33 members for the 1986 General Election, to 34 members for the 1993 election and then to its current figure of 35 from the 2004 General Election.

Under Spanish electoral law, all provinces are entitled to a minimum of 2 seats with a remaining 248 seats apportioned according to population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://electionresources.org/es/index_en.html General features of Spanish electoral system]&lt;/ref&gt; These laws are laid out in detail in the 1985 electoral law. (Ley Orgánica del Régimen Electoral General) The practical effect of this law has been to overrepresent smaller provinces at the expense of larger provinces like Madrid.

In 2004 for example Spain had 34,571,831 voters giving an average of 98,777 voters per deputy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionresources.org/es/congress.php?election=2004 2004 Spanish election]&lt;/ref&gt; In Madrid however the number of voters per deputy was 127,377&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionresources.org/es/congress.php?election=2004&amp;province=28 Madrid 2004 result]&lt;/ref&gt; the second largest ratio after Barcelona. In contrast the ratio was 38,714 and 26,177 respectively in the smallest provinces of Teruel &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionresources.org/es/congress.php?election=2004&amp;province=44 Teruel 2004 result]&lt;/ref&gt; and Soria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionresources.org/es/congress.php?election=2004&amp;province=42 Soria 2004 result]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Party strength by municipality==
Generally certain patterns have emerged in recent elections. The Popular Party (PP) normally polls best in the City of Madrid, with the PSOE polling best in the smaller municipalities, particularly those in the 'sur metropolitano' (South Metropolitan region) area which consists of the satellite towns to the immediate south and of Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madrid.org/iestadis/fijas/estructu/general/otros/descarga/congreso04t4.pdf Party votes by municipalities]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Within the Madrid autonomous community, PP generally polled best in the municipalities in the north and west of the community, while PSOE does best in the south and east of the community. IU normally failed to break the 10% barrier, but did do relatively well in many of the smaller municipalities and in one of them, Berzosa del Lozoya, in the north of the autonomous community, outpolled the other parties, albeit by just one vote out of 106 cast.

Exactly the same pattern was evident in 2004 within Madrid city itself with PP polling best in the districts in the north western half of the city and PSOE doing best in the south eastern half. PP polled best in the districts of Chamartín (67.9%), [[Salamanca (Madrid)|Salamanca]] (67.7%) and [[Chamberí (Madrid)|Chamberí]] (64.9%) while PSOE's best vote shares came in the [[Vallecas]] districts where they polled 61.4% in Puente de Vallecas and 56.9% in Villa de Vallecas. IU's best result was in [[Centro (Madrid)|Centro]] where they polled 10.4%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.madrid.org/iestadis/fijas/estructu/general/otros/descarga/congreso04t6.pdfParty votes within the city of Madrid 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Spanish general election, 2008|2008 Election]]==

As traditionally the prime ministerial candidate of each party is the leader of the Madrid list, PSOE's, PP's and IU's lists were led by [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]], [[Mariano Rajoy]] and [[Gaspar Llamazares]] respectively. In many political parties it is usually the number two on these lists who are considered the leader and left for discussion within the regional party branches. The current [[Second Vice-president (Spain)|Second Vice-President]] [[Pedro Solbes]] was offered this position &lt;ref&gt;{{es}}[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jMJ_HFRdZft-o048OKgbdNpR-gSg - AFP 26/11/07 Solbes will continue in the Government and be number two for Madrid]&lt;/ref&gt; with confederal environment Secretary of the [[Workers' Commissions]] trade union, Joaquin Nieto being offered that position for IU &lt;ref&gt;{{es}}[http://www.publico.es/espana/027474/gasparllamazares/joaquinnieto/iu/ccoo/congresodelosdiputados/eleccionesgenerales/2008 Público 14/12/07 Llamazares has a number two.]&lt;/ref&gt; Manuel Pizzarro, former Chairman of [[Endesa (Chile)|ENDESA]], was chosen to run as number two in the Madrid list of the Peoples' Party, his draft was announced at the time that current [[List of mayors of Madrid|Mayor Madrid]] [[Alberto Ruiz Gallardón]] was rejected for taking part in the party list.

'''Mariano Rajoy Brey''' ({{IPA-es|maˈɾjano raˈxoi}}; born 27 March 1955) is a Spanish [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] politician and the current [[Prime Minister of Spain]], having served since 21 December 2011.

Under [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]] [[José María Aznar]], Rajoy was Minister of Public Administration from 1996 to 1999 and Minister of Education from 1999 to 2000; he then served as Deputy Prime Minister from 2000 to 2003. Rajoy led the People's Party into the [[Spanish general election, 2004|March 2004 general election]], but that election was won by the opposition [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) in the aftermath of the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]]. Subsequently Rajoy was [[Leader of the Opposition (Spain)|Leader of the Opposition]] from 2004 to 2011.

==Early life and education==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=November 2011}}
Born in [[Santiago de Compostela]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], Rajoy graduated from the [[University of Santiago de Compostela]]. At the age of 24, he passed the competitive examination required in Spain to enter into the civil service, becoming the youngest ever property [[Recorder of deeds|registrar]].
Rajoy is the grandson of Henry Rajoy Leloup, one of the drafters of the Statute of Autonomy of Galicia in 1932 that was removed from university teaching by the dictatorship to the early 50's and is the son of Mariano Rajoy Sobredo jurist, president of the Provincial Court Pontevedra, a city where he grew up. His mother was Olga Lopez Brey, who died in 1993.

Law degree from the University of Santiago de Compostela, began preparing objections to the registrar of property in the final year and approved the following year. At 24 became the youngest registrar Spain. He was assigned to Register (Galicia), in Villafranca del Bierzo (León) and Santa Pola (Alicante) which still holds. With the same age, Rajoy was wounded in the face following a traffic accident. Since then, always wears a beard to hide the scars of these injuries.

However, being a registrar of property not delivered to the young Rajoy to the late conscription, which was primarily concerned with cleaning up the stairs of the Captaincy General of Valencia, graduating at the end of 1980.

==Legislative career==
===Early political career===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2011}}
Rajoy started his political career in 1981, as a member of the right-wing party [[People's Alliance]] (AP), becoming a deputy in the inaugural legislature of the [[Galician Parliament]]. In 1982, he was appointed by [[President of the Xunta de Galicia|Galician regional President]], Antonio Rosón Pérez, as Minister of Institutional Relations of the [[Xunta de Galicia]]. On June 11, 1986, Rajoy was elected President of the Provincial Council of [[Pontevedra]], a position he held until July 1991.

In the [[Spanish general election, 1986|General Elections]] of 22 June 1986, he obtained a seat in the Congress of Deputies as the head of the AP's list for [[Pontevedra (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Pontevedra]], although he resigned in November to take up the post of vice-president of the Xunta of Galicia following the resignation of Xosé Luis Barreiro and the rest of the ministers. He occupied this latter position until the end of September 1987.

When in 1989 the AP merged with other parties to form the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP), with [[Manuel Fraga]] as its president, Rajoy was named a member of its National Executive Committee and delegate for Pontevedra. He was reelected to parliament in 1993. Before the PP's triumph in the 1996 elections, he was a PP-designated member of the &quot;Commission of Parliamentary Control of the [[RTVE]]&quot;.

===Minister of the Interior: 1996–2004===
A long-time associate of [[José María Aznar]], Rajoy made the move into national politics when Aznar became Prime Minister in 1996 with the support of [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV), [[Convergence and Union]] (CiU) and the [[Canarian Coalition]], serving as  Minister of Public administration and Minister of Education and Culture in the first Aznar administration.

In 1996 he married a fellow Galician, Elvira Fernandez Balboa.

He managed the successful People's Party campaign in the [[Spanish legislative election, 2000|2000 elections]]. A grateful Aznar appointed him Deputy Prime Minister of the Spanish Government. In February 2001 he was named Minister of the Interior, after [[Jaime Mayor Oreja]] decided to run as head of the People's Party list in the [[Basque parliamentary election, 2001|2001 Basque Elections]].

On 30 August 2003 Aznar announced that he would retire from politics in the 2004 elections and proposed Rajoy as his successor. After the 14th Congress of the People's Party in October 2004 he became the new Chairman of the party, by then in the opposition, having lost the elections to the PSOE.

===Leader of the Opposition: 2004–2011===
Three days before the [[Spanish legislative election, 2004|2004 general elections]] [[11 March 2004 Madrid attacks|terrorist attacks]] occurred in [[Madrid]] on 11 March, which were initially blamed on [[ETA]] and later on [[Al-Qaeda]]. Aznar's government and Party leaders insisted on accusing the armed Basque separatist organisation ETA of the attacks, and on 13 March, Rajoy claimed to believe this because he was convinced of their will and capability for committing such crimes,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/papel/2004/03/13/espana/1606169.html |title=Ahora sería bueno que hubiera un gobierno con mayoría absoluta|publisher=El Mundo|date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government was accused of attempting to blame ETA for the attacks in order to stay on track to win the elections (as they were heavily favored to do), but then news broke that it was Al-Qaida, rather than ETA. 

On 14 March 2004 the PSOE, under the leadership of [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]], won the elections with a majority of 1,300,000 votes over the PP, and obtained 164 deputies, while the PP obtained 9,763,144 votes but 148 deputies, 35 less than they obtained in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.electionresources.org/es/congress.php?election=2004&amp;province=&lt;/ref&gt; Rajoy was elected for the province of [[Madrid (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Madrid]].

On 1 December 2005, Rajoy survived a helicopter accident, along with Madrid Regional Government President [[Esperanza Aguirre]]; he broke a finger in the accident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/01/madrid.crash/ CNN.com – Opposition leader survives Madrid helicopter crash – 1 Dec 2005]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rajoy faced a serious situation within his party after receiving public pressure from the electorally successful [[Alberto Ruiz Gallardón]] (Madrid's Mayor) to be included in the PP lists for the [[Spanish general election, 2008|March 2008 general election]]. Gallardón represents a more centrist sector within the party, whereas Rajoy, [[Angel Acebes]] and [[Eduardo Zaplana]] are widely accepted{{Vague|date=March 2008}} as representing a more conservative wing of the party, closer to Aznar{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}. Rajoy's final decision was to leave Gallardón out of the list for those elections, an action which provoked concern about the alienation of potential PP voters. Some experts and newspapers even argued that it could cost Rajoy the elections{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}. In any case, the power struggle for succession created a tense situation for him and for the party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a00a6290-c451-11dc-a474-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1 FT.com / World – Madrid mayor barred by own party&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 January 2008, Rajoy received the support of Germany's [[Angela Merkel]] and France's [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] for the March 2008 general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elimparcial.es/contenido/2087.html |title=Sarkozy y Merkel desean de &quot;todo corazón&quot; el triunfo de Mariano Rajoy |publisher=Elimparcial.es |date=2008-01-30 |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/videos/espana/Sarkozy/Merkel/le/desean/gran/exito/Rajoy/elpvidnac/20080130elpepunac_12/Ves/ |title=Video: Sarkozy y Merkel le desean &quot;un gran éxito&quot; a Rajoy |publisher=Elpais.com |date=2008-01-30 |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PP was defeated in the general election, however, and Rajoy continued to lead his party in opposition.

His criticisms of the Zapatero administration were focused on what he perceived as:

*The derogation of ambitious plans of the previous executive
**The ''Plan Hidrológico Nacional'' National Hydrological Plan
** The ''LOCE'' Organic Law on the Quality of Education
* The alleged &quot;unnecessary&quot; statutory reforms, such as submitted in the [[Catalonia|Catalan]], and [[Andalusia]]n referendums with very high levels of abstention. According to Rajoy, some of those reforms constitute concealed changes of the autonomous communities towards a confederation, endangering the integrity of the State. He has said that if Zapatero wants to apply his view of Spain, it would be better if he proposed a reform of the [[Spanish Constitution]], a reform that would need approval in a national referendum.
*The alleged weakness facing the peace process opened as a result of the permanent ceasefire declared by the organisation ETA in 2006, broken by the [[2006 Madrid Barajas International Airport bombing|Barajas bombing]] and the arms robbery.{{Specify|date=February 2009}}
*The introduction of a citizenship subject in the last years of secondary education (''Educación para la Ciudadanía'') of polemic content (whose opponents, counting the Catholic Church, and affiliated organisations, say is non-neutral and gives some left-wing political indoctrination). Rajoy announced its cancellation.
*The legalization of abortion until 14 weeks of pregnancy, a law that Mariano Rajoy sees as &quot;criminal&quot; and against the will of large sectors of the Spanish society.
*In [[Foreign policy]]
**The alleged cold relations with United States and Poland.
**The alliances with [[Venezuela]] and [[Hugo Chávez]], [[Cuba]] and [[Fidel Castro|Castro]] and [[Bolivia]] and [[Evo Morales]].
**Immigration policy.

===Prime Minister===
Following the [[Spanish general election, 2011|general election]] held in 2011, Rajoy was elected Prime Minister by the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]] on 21 December 2011.

'''María Teresa Fernández de la Vega Sanz''', [[Doctor of Laws|LLD]] (born 15 June 1949) is a [[Spaniard|Spanish]] [[Valencian people|Valencian]] [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist]] politician. From 18 April 2004 to 20 October 2010, she was the [[First Vice President (Spain)|First Deputy Prime Minister]], Minister of the Presidency and Cabinet Spokesperson in the government of Spanish Prime Minister [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpr.es/VicepresidentaPrimera/Biografia/biografia.htm Ministry of Presidency - First Vice Presidency of the Government of Spain]&lt;/ref&gt; She is the first female Deputy Prime Minister in Spanish history.

==Biography==
María Teresa Fernández de la Vega Sanz is the daughter of a high-ranking [[Spain under Franco|Francoist]] public servant, Wenceslao Fernández de la Vega Lombán, delegate of the [[Ministry of Employment]] headed at that time by Fermín Sanz Orrio (1957–1962). She earned a degree in [[Law]] in the [[Complutense University of Madrid]] in the early 1970s. She subsequently moved to [[Barcelona]], where she became a Doctor of Law. In 1974 she entered Spain's ''Cuerpo de Secretarios Jurídicos Laborales'', a specialised body of the civil service.

She started her political career in the [[Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia]], remaining a member of it until 1979. From 1982 until 1985, she was the Director of the Advisory Cabinet of the Minister of the Justice, and in 1985 she was appointed General Director of Services at the Ministry of Justice. In 1986 she became a member of the Legal Cooperation Committee of the [[Council of Europe]]. In 1990, she was chosen as a spokesperson of the [[General Council of the Judicial Power of Spain]] by decision of the [[Spanish Senate|Senate]] (1994–1996). On May 13, 1994, the then Minister [[Juan Alberto Belloch]] appointed her [[Secretary of State]] of Justice.

She was elected a Member of the [[Spanish Congress]] for [[Jaén (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Jaén]] in the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] candidacy for the 1996-2000 term, being re-elected in the elections of 2000 for [[Segovia (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Segovia]]. During this term she became General Secretary of the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist]] Parliamentary Group. In the [[Spanish general election, 2004|Spanish general election of 2004]] she became a Member of Parliament for [[Madrid (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Madrid]], and on 18 April of that year she was appointed [[First Vice President (Spain)|First Vice President of the Government]] and [[Minister of Presidency]], remaining the incumbent of each. For the 2008 election she headed the list for the PSOE in [[Valencia (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Valencia]].

María Teresa Fernández de la Vega was the first woman to take on the functions of the [[Prime Minister of Spain|President of government]] in the history of [[Modern Spain|Spanish democracy]], when, on April 24, 2004, during the first official visit abroad of Spain's prime minister, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, she presided over the Council of Ministers.

In March 2006 the First Vice President went on an African tour with the State Secretary for Cooperation, [[Leire Pajín]], visiting [[Kenya]] and [[Mozambique]], in whose capital, [[Maputo]], they celebrated [[International Women's Day]] and closed the forum &quot;Spain-Africa: Women for a better world&quot;.

In 7 October 2006 she received the [[Francisco Tomás y Valiente|Tomás y Valiente]] Award in [[Fuenlabrada]], [[Madrid]].

Fernández de la Vega has a degree in Communitarian [[Law]] from the University of [[Strasbourg]] and is a member of Justices for democracy (Jueces para la Democracia). She has written many papers, including ''La reforma de la jurisdicción laboral'' and ''Derechos humanos y Consejo de Europa''.

The current office is established under the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Constitution of 1978]]. The [[Monarchy of Spain|King of Spain]] nominates a candidate for the presidency who stands before the Congress of Deputies for a Vote of Confidence in a process known as a ''Congressional [[Investiture]]'', effectively an [[indirect election]] of the [[head of government]] by the elected Congressional delegates.

[[Mariano Rajoy Brey]] of the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] as been the prime minister since he was sworn in on December 21, 2011, after winning the [[Spanish general election, 2011|2011 general election]].

==Official title==
The Spanish head of government is known, in Spanish, as the ''Presidente del Gobierno de España''. Literally translated, the title is &quot;President of the Government of Spain&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;moncloa&quot;&gt;[http://www.la-moncloa.es/IDIOMAS/9/Presidente/Biografia/default.htm Official web site of La Moncloa, the Spanish Prime Minister's Office] Accessed 2009-03-05&lt;/ref&gt; or alternatively &quot;Chairman of the Government&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Spanish Dictionary and Grammar'', ed. C.Lea ''et al.'', 2nd ed.(2001)&lt;/ref&gt; but nevertheless the office-holder is commonly referred to in English as the &quot;[[prime minister]]&quot;, the usual term for the head of government in a [[parliamentary system]]. However the Spanish for 'prime minister' is ''primer ministro''; thus, for example, the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] is the ''Primer Ministro del Reino Unido'', not the ''Presidente del Gobierno''.

In Spain the head of the government is often called simply ''Presidente'', meaning 'President'. This sometimes causes confusion since it is the usual term for the head of government in a republic; former governor of Florida [[Jeb Bush]] once mistakenly referred to the &quot;President of the Republic of Spain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Jeb/Bush/agradece/apoyo/presidente/Republica/espanola/elpepiesp/20030218elpepinac_7/Tes El País 18/02/2003. &quot;Jeb Bush Thanks the support of the &quot;President of the Spanish Republic&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The custom to name the head of government as &quot;President&quot; dates back to the reign of [[Isabella II of Spain]], when the official title was ''Presidente del Consejo de Ministros'' (&quot;President of the Council of Ministers&quot;). Before 1833 the figure was known as ''Secretario de Estado'' (&quot;Secretary of State&quot;), a denomination used today for [[junior minister]]s.

==Royal nomination and congressional confirmation==
Once a [[Elections in Spain|general election]] has been announced by the king, political parties nominate their candidates to stand for the presidency of the government. An outgoing president who is not running in that election remains in office as a caretaker until their successor is sworn in, such as [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]]; this differs from other parliamentary governments whose prime ministers always lead their parties during the election campaign.

Following the general election of the [[Cortes Generales]] (''Cortes''), and other circumstances provided for in the constitution, the king meets with and interviews the [[List of political parties in Spain|political party leaders]] represented in the Congress of Deputies, and then consults with the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Speaker of the Congress of Deputies]] (officially, ''Presidente de Congreso de los Diputados de España'', who, in this instance, represents the ''whole'' of the Cortes Generales and was himself elected from within the Congress to be the Speaker) before nominating his candidate for the presidency, according to Section 99 of Title IV.&lt;ref name=&quot;King and Prime Minister&quot;&gt;[http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Constituci%C3%B3n_espa%C3%B1ola_de_1978:_06 Part IV Government and Administration]&lt;/ref&gt; Often minor parties form part of a larger major party, and through that membership it can be said that the king fulfills his constitutional mandate of consulting with party representatives with Congressional representation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Title IV Government and Administration
Section 99(1) &amp; (2)
*(1) After each renewal of the Congress and the other cases provided for under the Constitution, the King shall, after consultation with the representatives appointed by the political groups with parliamentary representation, and through the Speaker of the Congress, nominate for the Presidency of the Government.
*(2) The candidate nominated in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing subsection shall submit to the Congress the political program of the Government he or she intends to form and shall seek the confidence of the House.&lt;ref name=&quot;King and Prime Minister&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Artículo 99.

*1.'' Después de cada renovación del Congreso de los Diputados, y en los demás supuestos constitucionales en que así proceda, el Rey, previa consulta con los representantes designados por los grupos políticos con representación parlamentaria, y a través del Presidente del Congreso, propondrá un candidato a la Presidencia del Gobierno.''
*2. ''El candidato propuesto conforme a lo previsto en el apartado anterior expondrá ante el Congreso de los Diputados el programa político del Gobierno que pretenda formar y solicitará la confianza de la Cámara.''&lt;ref name=&quot;King and Prime Minister&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Constitutionally, the monarch may nominate anyone he sees fit as his prerogative. However, it remains pragmatic for monarch to nominate a candidate who is most likely to enjoy the confidence of the Congress of Deputies and [[Government of Spain|form a government]], usually the political leader whose party commands the most seats in the Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;King and Prime Minister&quot;/&gt; For the Crown to nominate the political leader whose party controls the Congress can be seen as a royal endorsement of the democratic process— a fundamental concept enshrined in the 1978 Constitution.

By [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|political custom]] established by [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]] since the ratification of the 1978 Constitution, the king's nominees have all been from parties who maintain a plurality of seats in the Congress. However, there is no legal requirement for this. It has never happened in the national government, but the largest party could end up not ruling if rival parties gather into a majority, forming a [[coalition]]. This scenario is unlikely as political activity in Spain has effectively coalesced into a [[two-party system]] between the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] and the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]], with the two major parties adopting some aspects of the minor party platforms in an effort to attract them into a coalition to edge out their rival party.

The monarch is normally to able announce his nominee the day following a general election.

The monarch's order nominating a presidential candidate is countersigned by the Speaker of the Congress, who then presents the nominee before the Congress of Deputies in a process known as a ''[[Investiture|Congressional Investiture]]'' (''Investidura parlamentaria''). During the Investiture proceedings the nominee presents his [[manifesto|political agenda]] in an ''Investiture Speech'' to be debated and submitted for a [[Vote of Confidence]] (''Cuestión de confianza'') by the Congress, effecting an [[indirect election]] of the head of government.&lt;ref name=&quot;King and Prime Minister&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;08 April 2008 Investiture Speech&quot;&gt;[http://www.la-moncloa.es/IDIOMAS/9/Presidente/Discursodeinvestidura/Introduction.htm Speech by Zapatero at the session for his investiture as President]&lt;/ref&gt; A simple majority confirms the nominee and his program.&lt;ref name=&quot;King and Prime Minister&quot;/&gt;  At the moment of the vote, the confidence is awarded if the candidate receives a majority of votes in the first poll (currently 176 out of 350 MPs), but if the confidence is not awarded, a second vote is scheduled two days later in which a simple majority of votes cast (i.e., more &quot;yes&quot; than &quot;no&quot; votes) is required.

After the nominee is confirmed, the Speaker of the Congress formally reports to the king of the congressional confirmation. The king then appoints the candidate as the new President of the Government. The king's order of appointment is countersigned by the Speaker. During the inauguration ceremony performed by the king, customarily at the ''Salón de Audiencias'' in the [[Palacio de la Zarzuela|Zarzuela Palace]], the [[president elect]] of the Government takes an [[oath of office]] over an open constitution and next to the [[Holy Bible]]. The oath as taken by President Zapatero on his first term in office on 17 April 2004 was;&lt;ref name=&quot;zapatero_sworn_in&quot;&gt;{{es icon}} Video: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3AZ47GZ0w Rodríguez Zapatero is sworn in to his second term] ([[RTVE]]'s [[Canal 24 Horas|Canal 24H]], April 12, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;:

}}

In 2008, from the time the king nominated [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] for a second term as president immediately following the 2008 general election, almost a month passed before Zapatero was able to present his Investiture Speech before the Congress and stand for a Vote of Confidence.&lt;ref name=&quot;08 April 2008 Investiture Speech&quot;/&gt; If no overall majority was obtained on the first Vote of the Confidence, then the same nominee and program is resubmitted for a second vote within forty-eight hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;King and Prime Minister&quot;/&gt; Following the second vote, if confidence by the Congress is still unreached, then the monarch again meets with political leaders and the Speaker, and submits a new nominee for a vote of confidence.&lt;ref name=&quot;King and Prime Minister&quot;/&gt; If, within two months, no candidate has won the confidence of the Congress then the King dissolves the Cortes and calls for a new general election.&lt;ref name=&quot;King and Prime Minister&quot;/&gt; The King's royal decree is countersigned by the Speaker of the Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;King and Prime Minister&quot;/&gt;

Once appointed, the President of the Government forms his government whose ministers are appointed and removed by the King on the president's advice. In the political life of Spain, the king would already be familiar with the various political leaders in a professional capacity, and perhaps less formally in a more social capacity, facilitating their meeting following a general election. Conversely, nominating the party leader whose party maintains a plurality and who are already familiar with their party [[manifesto]] facilitates a smoother nomination process. In the event of [[Coalition government|coalitions]], the political leaders would customarily have met beforehand to hammer out a coalition agreement before their meeting with the King.

Governments and the Cortes sit for a term no longer than four years when the president tenders his resignation to the king and advises the king to dissolve the Cortes, prompting a general election. It remains within the king's prerogative to dissolve the Cortes if, at the conclusion of the four years, the president has not asked for its dissolution, according to Title II Section 56.&lt;ref&gt;Title II Section 56 the monarch is the &quot;arbitrator and moderator of the regular functioning of the institutions&quot;, &quot;arbitra y modera el funcionamiento regular de las instituciones&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The king may call for earlier elections on the advice of the president, known as a [[snap election]], but no sooner than a year after the prior general election.&lt;ref&gt;Snap elections have been used only threes since the 1978 Constitution was ratified, ex-PM [[Felipe González]] invoked his constitutional right to dissolve the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] three times in 1989, 1993 and 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, if the Government loses the confidence of the Cortes, then it must resign.

In the event that a president dies or becomes incapacitated while in office, then the government as a whole resigns and the process of royal nomination and appointment takes place. The vice president would then take over the day to day operations in the meantime, even while the vice president himself may be nominated by the King and stand for a vote of confidence.

==Constitutional authority==
Title IV of the Constitution defines the government and its responsibilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;King and Prime Minister&quot;/&gt; The government consists of the [[Council of Ministers of Spain|President of the Government and ministers of state]]. The government conducts domestic and [[Foreign relations of Spain|foreign policy]], civil and military administration, and the [[Spanish Armed Forces|defense of the nation]] all in the name of the king on behalf of the people. Additionally, the government exercises executive authority and statutory regulations.&lt;ref name=&quot;King and Prime Minister&quot;/&gt; 

There is no provision in the Spanish Constitution for explicitly granting any [[emergency powers]] to the government, which could be understood as exorcizing the ghost of the recent [[Francoist Spain|dictatorship in Spain]]. However, Title II, Sections 56 of the constitution vests the monarch as the &quot;arbitrator and moderator of the institutions&quot; of government, ''[The King] arbitrates and moderates the regular functioning of the institutions'' (''arbitra y modera el funcionamiento regular de las instituciones'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiki Source Spa Constitution 78&quot;&gt;[http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Constituci%C3%B3n_espa%C3%B1ola_de_1978:_04 Título II. De la Corona, Wikisource]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Official website of the Royal Household&quot;&gt;[http://www.casareal.es/laCorona/laCorona-iden-idweb.html The Royal Household of H.M. The King website]&lt;/ref&gt; This provision could be understood as allowing the king or his government ministers to exercise emergency authority in times of national crisis, such as when the king used his authority to back the government of the day and call for the military to abandon the [[23-F|23-F coup attempt]] in 1981.

==Peerages==

[[Spanish nobility|Peerages in Spain]] are created by the Grace of the King, according to the Spanish Ministry of Justice, and are the highest marks of distinction that he may bestow in his capacity as the ''[[Fount of honour|fons honorum]]'' in Spain. Conventionally, the ''Title of Concession'' creating the dignity must be countersigned by a government minister. When a title is created for a former president, the succeeding president customarily countersigns the royal decree. As a reward for national service, the king awarded peerages to two of his former presidents who have since retired from active politics: [[Adolfo Suárez]] was created 1st [[Duke of Suárez]]; and [[Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo, 1st Marquess of la Ría de Ribadeo|Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo]] was created 1st [[Marquess of la Ría de Ribadeo]]. Additional titles of nobility have been created by the king for other government ministers, usually at the advice of the president of the government. 

As of 2005, the king has created 40 hereditary titles of nobility.

==Recent Presidents of the Government==
This is a list of the people who have held the office of President of the Government of Spain since the [[Spanish transition to democracy]]. For the full list since the predecessor office of Secretary of the Universal Bureau was created (1705), see [[List of Prime Ministers of Spain]].

'''Sonsoles Espinosa Díaz''' (born 8 November 1961) is a Spanish classical singer and music teacher. She is married to [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]], former [[Prime Minister of Spain|President of the Government]] (''Presidente del Gobierno'', essentially Prime Minister) of [[Spain]]. 

She was born in [[Ávila, Spain|Ávila]], the daughter of a military officer, and received a law degree from the [[Universidad de León]]. She met Rodríguez Zapatero in [[León, León|León]] in 1981. They married on 27 January 1990 and have two daughters, born 1993 and 1995.

Sonsoles is a soprano and music teacher, and several times she stated she loves singing soft rock music. While living in [[León, Spain|León]], she was a member of the city's prestigious university choir and used to be a music teacher for 7 to 9 graders at one of León's and Spain's most prestigious schools, Colegio Leonés. Since moving to Madrid she has continued to sing, as a substitute member of the chorus at the city's opera house, the [[Teatro Real]], and more recently with the choir of the government-owned broadcasting service [[RTVE]].

In 2003, she gave an interview to the magazine ''La Razón'', where some of her opinions about abortion generated controversy, mainly from right-wing think tank groups. She said abortion should be legal in all countries and that &quot;those who don't understand this are people from the 18th century.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The '''Spanish Socialist Workers' Party''' ({{lang-es|Partido Socialista Obrero Español}} {{IPA-es|parˈtiðo soθjaˈlista oˈβrero espaˈɲol|}}  {{audio|es_partido-socialista-obrero-espanol_001.ogg|listen}}; '''PSOE''' {{IPA-es|peˈsoe|}}  {{audio|es_psoe_001.ogg|listen}} ) is a [[social democracy|social-democratic]]&lt;ref name=&quot;parties-and-elections.de&quot;&gt;[http://www.parties-and-elections.de/spain.html Parties and Elections in Europe: The database about parliamentary elections and political parties in Europe, by Wolfram Nordsieck]&lt;/ref&gt; [[political party]] in [[Spain]]. Its political position is Centre-left. The PSOE is the former ruling party of Spain, until beaten in the elections of November 2011 and the second oldest, exceeded only by the [[Carlism|Partido Carlista]], founded in 1833.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The PSOE has had strong ties with the [[Unión General de Trabajadores| General Union of Workers]] (UGT), a Spanish [[trade union]]. For decades, UGT membership was a requirement for PSOE membership. During the 1980s, though, UGT criticised the economic policies of the PSOE, even calling for a [[general strike]] on December 14, 1988.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

The PSOE recently lost the [[Spanish general election, 2011|general elections]] on 20 November 2011. The PSOE is a full member of the [[Party of European Socialists]] and the [[Socialist International]].&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psoe.es/ambito/historiapsoe/docs/index.do?action=View&amp;id=992 |title=History of PSOE|publisher=PSOE own site |accessdate=2007-07-11 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[European Parliament]], the PSOE's 21 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] sit in the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats|Socialists and Democrats]] [[Political groups of the European Parliament|European parliamentary group]].

== Ideology ==
The PSOE was founded with the purpose of representing the interests of the [[working class]] born from the [[Industrial Revolution]] with the declared objective of achieving [[socialism]], and inspired by the revolutionary principles of [[Marxism]].

After the 1979 extraordinary congress, the PSOE renounced Marxism as its main ideology, becoming a social-democratic party. Currently, the party has moved away from [[left-wing politics]], adopting a [[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]] approach and supporting free-market policies, including reforms to curtail the Spanish [[welfare state]].

==Early history (1879 - 1974)==

[[Image:Casa labra.jpg|250px|thumb|''Casa Labra'' Pub]]

The PSOE was founded on May 2, 1879 in the ''Casa Labra'' Pub (city of [[Madrid]]) by the historical Spanish workers' leader [[Pablo Iglesias]].&lt;ref name=History/&gt; The first program of the new political party was passed in an assembly of 40 people, on July 20 of that same year. Although the PSOE was rather weak during the late 19th century, its active participation in strikes from 1899 to 1902 and especially its electoral coalition with the main Republican parties led in 1910 to the election of Pablo Iglesias as the first Socialist representative in the [[Spanish Cortes]].

The party was a member of the [[Labour and Socialist International]] between 1923 and 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski, Werner. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=83QdPwAACAAJ Geschichte der sozialistischen arbeiter-internationale: 1923 - 19]''. Berlin: Dt. Verl. d. Wissenschaften, 1985. p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;

PSOE formed part of the Spanish government during the [[Second Spanish Republic]] and as part of the [[Spanish Popular Front]], elected to government in February 1936. During the civil war years, PSOE was divided into three wings: a leftist revolutionary [[Marxist]] wing, led by [[Francisco Largo Caballero]] that advocated [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], [[nationalization]] of every industry, and total redistribution of land; a moderate, social-democratic faction,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} led by [[Indalecio Prieto]]; and a reformist one, led by [[Julian Besteiro]].&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

The dictator [[Francisco Franco]] banned the PSOE in 1939, and the party was legalised again in 1977. During Franco's rule members of the PSOE was persecuted, with many leaders, members and supporters being imprisoned or [[exile]]d and even executed.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

==Modern history (1974 - present day)==
Its 25th Congress was held in [[Toulouse]] in August 1972. In 1974 at its 26th Congress in [[Suresnes]], [[Felipe González]] was elected Secretary General, replacing [[Rodolfo Llopis Ferrándiz]]. González was from the &quot;reform&quot; wing of the party, and his victory signaled a defeat for the historic and veteran wing of the Party. The direction of the party shifted from the exiles to the young people in Spain who hadn't fought the war.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

Llopis led a schism to form the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (historic)]] González showed intentions to move the party away from its [[Marxism|Marxist]] and [[socialism|socialist]] background, turning the PSOE into a social-democratic party, similar to those of the rest of western Europe. In 1977 PSOE became the official [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]] party with 29.2% of the vote and 118 seats in the [[Cortes Generales|Parliament]]. Their standing was further boosted in 1978 when the 6 deputies of the [[Popular Socialist Party (Spain)|Popular Socialist Party]] agreed to merge with the party.

In their 27th congress in May 1979 González resigned because the party would not abandon its Marxist character. In September the extraordinary 28th congress was called in which González was re-elected when the party agreed to move away from Marxism. European social-democratic parties supported González's stand, and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] granted them money. The PSOE party symbol was changed from the [[anvil with the book]] to the social-democratic [[rose]] in the fist, as used by the French [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]]. In the referendum of 1978, PSOE supported the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Spanish Constitution]], which was approved. In the [[Spanish general election, 1979|1979 Spanish general election]] the PSOE gained 30.5% of the vote and 121 seats, remaining the main opposition party.

At the 28 October [[Spanish general election, 1982|1982 Spanish general election]], the PSOE was victorious, with 48.5% of the vote (10,000,000 total). Felipe González became [[Prime Minister of Spain]] on 2 December, a position he held until March 1996.

Though the party had previously opposed [[NATO]], after reaching the government most party leaders supported keeping Spain inside the organisation. The González administration organised a referendum on the question in 1986, calling for a favourable vote, and won. The administration was criticised for avoiding the official names of ''North Atlantic Treaty Organisation'' and ''NATO'', using the unofficial ''Atlantic Alliance'' terms. A symbol of this U-turn is [[Javier Solana]] who campaigned against NATO but ended up years later as its Secretary General.

PSOE Supported the United States in the [[Gulf War]] (1991). The PSOE won the 1986, 1989 and 1993 general elections.

Economic crisis, several corruption scandals{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} and [[state terrorism]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} ([[Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación|GAL]]) against the violent separatist group [[ETA]] eroded the popularity of Felipe González, and in 1996, the PSOE lost the elections to the conservative [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP). Between 1996 and 2001 the PSOE weathered a crisis, with Gonzalez resigning in 1997. The PSOE suffered a heavy defeat in 2000 (34.7%).

The PSOE remained as the ruling party in the [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] of [[Andalusia]], [[Extremadura]], [[Castilla-La Mancha]] and [[Asturias]].

[[File:José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero - Royal &amp; Zapatero's meeting in Toulouse for the 2007 French presidential election 0205 2007-04-19b.jpg|thumb|right|[[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]]]]
In 2001, a new general secretary, [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] (also known as ZP), was elected, renewing the party. Later, the PSOE won the municipal elections of 2003.

PSOE strongly opposed to the [[Iraq War]], which was supported by the PP.

On 13 November 2003 the PSOE ([[Socialists' Party of Catalonia|Socialist Party of Catalonia]], PSC) increased its vote total but scored second in the regional election in [[Catalonia]], after [[Convergence and Union]]. After a period of negotiations, the party formed a pact with [[Republican Left of Catalonia]], [[Initiative for Catalonia Greens]] and the [[United and Alternative Left]], and have governed in Catalonia since then.

On 14 March 2004, the PSOE won the [[Spanish legislative election, 2004|2004 Spanish general election]] with almost 43% of the votes, following the [[11-M]] terrorist (March 11) attacks, and maintained their lead in the elections to the European Parliament.

In 2005, PSOE called for a Yes vote on the [[Treaty establishing a constitution for Europe|European Constitution]]. It has since legalised [[same-sex marriage in Spain|same-sex marriage]], and has called for further integration into the EU. PSOE also favoured the negotiations between the government and [[ETA]] during the 2006 cease-fire, which de-facto ended with the [[Barajas Airport]] [[2006 Madrid Barajas International Airport bombing|terrorist attack]].

On 9 March 2008 the PSOE won the [[Spanish general election, 2008|2008 Spanish general elections]] again with José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero remaining Prime Minister of Spain. The Socialists increased their share of seats in the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]] from 164 to 169 after the latest election.

However, after waning popularity throughout their second term, mainly due to their handling of the worsening economic climate in Spain in the aftermath of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, the PSOE were defeated in the [[Spanish general election, 2011|general elections of November 2011]], winning just 28.76% of the popular vote and handing the [[People's Party (Spain)|PP]] a landslide victory.

==Terms==
* '''[[Baron]]''': Unofficial term for the party's regional leaders. They can be very powerful, especially if they run an autonomous community. There have been conflicts between barons and the central directorate in the past. Some barons were [[Pasqual Maragall]] ([[Catalonia]]), who didn't run for re-election in 2006; [[Juan Carlos Rodríguez Ibarra]] ([[Extremadura]]), who didn't run for re-election in 2007; [[Manuel Chaves]] ([[Andalucia]]), who renounced Andalucia's presidency in 2009 to assume Third Vice Presidency of the Spanish Government; [[José Montilla]] ([[Catalonia]]), now opposition leader. The term barón is more colloquial than official, representing the great power regional leaders have in the party, but  its falling in disuse since 2008. 
* '''''Compañero''''' (&quot;companion&quot;, &quot;comrade&quot;): A term of address among Socialists, analogous to the English [[comrade]].
* '''Currents''': There have been several internal groups within PSOE, based on personal or ideological affinities. Some of them have ended with separation from the PSOE. The failed trial of [[primary election]]s for PSOE candidates was an attempt to conciliate currents. Examples of currents are &quot;Guerristas&quot; (followers of [[Alfonso Guerra]]), &quot;[[Renovadores]]&quot; (renewers, right wing of the Party) or Izquierda Socialista (Socialist Left).

The '''University of León''' is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[public university]] with [[campus]] in [[León, Spain|León]] and [[Ponferrada]].

The germ of the university is found in [[1843]], when it was created the Normal School for Teachers or Masters Seminar of Public Instruction and the subaltern school of Veterinary Medicine, founded in [[1852]], laying the foundations of Leon future university. Founded in [[1979]] as a splitting of the [[University of Oviedo]], from the various schools and colleges that depend on that, more or less existed long ago in the city of [[Leon, Spain|Leon]].

In recent years the university has signed important cooperation agreements, among which the one signed with the [[University of Washington]], which has allowed the installation in [[León, Spain|Leon]] of the second European Headquarters this university to learn Spanish, with capacity for 500 students, and signed with the [[University of Xiangtan]], which has led to the establishment in the city of [[Confucius Institute]].

== Faculties and Schools ==

'''Valladolid''' ({{IPA-es|baʎaðoˈlið|lang|Valladolid.ogg}}) is a historic city and [[municipalities of Spain|municipality]] in north-central Spain, situated at the confluence of the [[Pisuerga River|Pisuerga]] and [[Esgueva]] rivers, and located within three wine-making regions: [[Ribera del Duero]], [[Rueda (DO)|Rueda]] and [[Cigales]]. It is the capital of the [[province of Valladolid]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Braun Valladolid UBHD.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Vallisoletum'', 1574 by Braun and Hogenberg.]]

One line of etymological argument suggests that the modern name &quot;Valladolid&quot; derives from a [[Celtiberian language]] expression, ''Vallis Tolitum'' (&quot;Waters Valley&quot;), due to the confluence of rivers. Another, more generally accepted derivation is from the demonym ''Vallisoletano'', which was, in fact, the Spanish [[demonym]] of the city, and means &quot;from sunny valley&quot;. Supporting this are texts from the Middle Ages, which use ''Vallisoletum'', a word which continued to be used as late as the 16th century (see painting by Braun and Hogenberg).  

It is also popularly called ''Pucela'', a nickname whose origin is not clear, but probably refers to a few knights who accompanied [[Joan of Arc]], known as La Pucelle. Another theory is that ''Pucela'' comes from the fact that Puzzeli's cement was sold there, the only city in Spain that sold it.

==History==

[[File:Torneo en la Plaza Mayor grande.jpg|thumb|left|'A [[jousting]] tournament in the main square of Valladolid', historical ceiling preserved in Prado Museum]]

Remains of [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] and of a [[ancient Rome|Roman]] camp have been excavated near the city. The nucleus of the city was originally located in the area of the current San Miguel y el Rosarillo square, and was surrounded by a palisade. Archaeological proofs of the existence of three ancient lines of walls have been found.

During the time of Moorish rule in Spain the Christian kings moved the population of this region north into more easily defended areas, and deliberately created a no-mans' land as a buffer zone against further Moorish conquests. The area was captured from the [[Moors]] in the 10th century,  and Valladolid was a village until king [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile]] donated it to count [[Pedro Ansúrez]] in 1072. He built a palace (now lost) for himself and his wife, countess Eylo, the Collegiate of St. Mary and the La Antigua churches. In the 12th and 13th centuries, Valladolid grew rapidly, thanks also to the commercial privileges granted by the kings [[Alfonso VIII of Castile|Alfonso VIII]] and [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X]], as well as to the repopulation of the area after the [[Reconquista]].

In 1469 Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] and King Ferdinand of Aragon were married in the city; by the 15th  century Valladolid was the residence of the [[kings of Castile]] and remained the capital of the [[Kingdom of Spain]] until 1561, when the city was destroyed by a fire and [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], born here, moved the capital to [[Madrid]], starting a period of decadence for Valladolid. In 1506 [[Christopher Columbus]] died in Valladolid in a house which is now a Museum dedicated to him. It was made the capital of the kingdom again between 1601 and 1606 by [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]]. The city was again damaged by a flood of the Pisuerga and Esgueva rivers.

[[File:Valladolid - Catedral.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Cathedral of Valladolid]]]]
Despite the damage to the old city by the 1960s economic boom, it still boasts a few architectural manifestations of its former glory. Some monuments include the [[unfinished building|unfinished]] [[Valladolid Cathedral|cathedral]], the [[Plaza Mayor, Valladolid|Plaza Mayor]] (Main Square), which was the template for [[Plaza Mayor of Madrid|that of Madrid]], and of other main squares throughout the former Spanish empire, the National Sculpture Museum, next to the church of Saint Paul, which includes Spain's greatest collections of polychrome wood sculptures, and the Faculty of Law of the [[University of Valladolid]], whose façade is one of the few surviving works by [[Narciso Tomei]], the same artist who did the transparente in [[Cathedral of Toledo|Toledo Cathedral]]. The Science Museum is next to Pisuerga river. The only surviving house of [[Miguel de Cervantes]] is also located in Valladolid. Although unfinished, [[Cathedral of Valladolid]] was designed by [[Juan de Herrera]], architect of [[El Escorial]].

==Main sights==
The capital of Castile y León preserves in its old quarter  heritage of aristocratic houses and religious buildings.

===Interesting religious buildings===

*The unfinished [[Cathedral of Valladolid|Cathedral]], commissioned by King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and designed by the architect [[Juan de Herrera]] in the 16th century, following a mannierist style perhaps influenced by [[Michelangelo]]. The church is unfinished due to financial problems and its nave was not opened until 1668. Years later, in 1730, Master [[Churriguera]] finished the work on the main front. Inside the cathedral, the sanctuary houses a [[reredos]] made by [[Juan de Juni]] in 1562. The complex is linked to the Diocesan Museum, which holds carvings attributed to [[Gregorio Fernández]] and Juni himself, as well as a silver [[monstrance]] by [[Juan de Arce]].
*The large Gothic church of San Benito, built by the Benedictines between 1500 and 1515, with an unusual tower.
*San Miguel Church, antient church of the Jesuits (now, parish church), built at the end of the 16th century, hosts some reredos by the early 17th-century sculptor Gregorio Fernández.
*The façade of the Dominic's Church of [[San Pablo Church|San Pablo]], characterized by Gothic statues and decoration built around 1500.
*El Salvador Church, with a façade built around 1550, a 15th-century Flemish reredos and a brick tower dating from the 17th century.
*The church of Santiago has reredos depicting the ''Adoration of the Magi'' (1537) created by [[Berruguete]] and, in the sanctuary, a great baroque reredos depicting [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]] killing moors, as usual in Spain.
*The Gothic [[Santa María La Antigua|church of Santa maría la Antigua]] has an unusual pyramid-shaped Romanesque tower from the 12th century and a 14th century gothic sanctuary, influenced by the Cathedgral of Burgos..
*The [[Santa María la Real de las Huelgas (Valladolid)|Convent of Santa María la Real de las Huelgas]], originally built about 1600, following Spanish mannierist tendencies.
*''Convento de Santa Ana'', a neoclassical building housing various paintings by [[Francisco de Goya]].

The heart of the old city is the 16th-century [[Plaza Mayor of Valladolid|Plaza Mayor]], presided over by a statue of [[Pedro Ansúrez|Count Ansúrez]] from 1903. On one side of it stands the [[City Hall]], an eclectic building dating from the beginning of the 20th century, crowned by a clock tower. In the nearby streets is the [[Palace of Los Pimentel]], today the seat of the Provincial Council, is one of the most important, as King Philip II was born here on 21 May 1527. The [[Valladolid Royal Palace|Royal Palace]] (where King Philip IV of Spain and Queen Anne of France, mother of Louis XIV were born), the 16th-century Palace of the Marquises of Valverde, and that of the banker [[Fabio Nelli]] – a building with a Classicist stamp built in 1576 – should also be pointed out. The Museum of Valladolid occupies this complex, exhibiting a collection of furniture, sculptures, paintings and ceramic pieces dated from Prehistoric times to the present.

The [[Teatro Lope de Vega, Valladolid|Teatro Lope de Vega]] is a theater built in the classical style in 1861 and now very run-down. There has been controversy over whether the city should pay to restore it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Demografía Valladolid (España).PNG|thumb|right|300px|Population of Valladolid (1900&amp;ndash;2005)]]

==Population==
As of the 2004 census, the population of the city of Valladolid proper was 321,713, and the population of the entire urban area was estimated to be near 420,000. After the new neighbourhoods developed in last decades (one example would be [[Covaresa]]) the high prices in the municipality lead the youth people to buy properties in towns around the city, so the population tend to fall in Valladolid but grow fast in the rest of the urban area (for example, [[Arroyo de la Encomienda]] or [[Zaratán]])

[[File:227021542 3b4805c63c b.jpg|thumb|Old streets in Valladolid]]

==Economy==
Valladolid is, economically speaking, the most important city of the autonomous community, having an important automobile industry ([[IVECO]], [[FASA-Renault]], [[Michelin]]).

==Transportation==
There is an airport at nearby Villanubla (10&amp;nbsp;km of Valladolid city centre), with connections to London-Stansted, Paris, Brussels&amp;ndash;[[Charleroi]], [[Milan]], [[Lisbon]], [[Düsseldorf]], [[Barcelona]], [[Málaga]], [[Alicante]], [[Balearic Islands]] and [[Canary Islands]].

==Seminci==
{{main|Valladolid International Film Festival}}
The city is also host to one of the foremost (and oldest) international film festivals, the ''Semana Internacional de Cine de Valladolid ([[Seminci]])'', founded in 1956.

==Local cuisine==
[[File:ArrozLeche-Cubero-2009.jpg|thumb|The ''Arroz con Leche''.]]
[[File:Pasteles-San Lorenzo-Valladolid-2009.jpg|thumb|''Pasteles de San Lorenzo'']]

Although an inland province, fish is commonly consumed. Brought from the [[Bay of Biscay|Cantabrian Sea]], fish like red bream and hake are a major part of Valladolid's cuisine.

The main speciality of Valladolid is, however, lechazo (suckling baby lamb). The lechazo is slowly roasted in a wood oven and served with salad.

Valladolid also offers a great assortment of wild mushrooms. Asparagus, endive and beans can also be found. Some legumes, like white beans and lentils are particularly good. Pine nuts are also produced in great quantities.

Sheep cheese from Villalón de Campos, the famous pata de mulo (mule's leg) is usually unripened (fresh), but if it is cured the ripening process brings out such flavour that it can compete with the best sheep cheeses in Spain.

In the area of bread Valladolid has a bread to go with every dish, like the delicious cuadros from Medina del Campo, the muffins, the pork-scratching bread and the lechuguinos, with a pattern of concentric circles that resemble a head of lettuce.

The pastries and baked goods from the province of Valladolid are well-known, specially St. Mary's ring-shaped pastries, St. Claire's sponge cakes, pine nut balls and cream fritters.

Valladolid is also a producer of wines. The ones that fall under the Designation of Origin [[Cigales]] are very good. White wines from [[Rueda (DO)|Rueda]] and red wines from [[Ribera del Duero]] are known for their quality.

==Easter==

&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Holy Week in Spain]] --&gt;
Easter holds (&quot;Semana Santa&quot; in Spanish) one of the best known Catholic traditions in Valladolid. The Good Friday processions are considered an exquisite and rich display of Castilian religious sculpture. On this day, in the morning, members of the brotherhoods on horseback make a poetic proclamation throughout the city. The &quot;Sermon of the Seven Words&quot; is spoken in Plaza Mayor Square. In the afternoon, thousands of people take part in the Passion Procession, comprising 31 pasos (religious statues), most of which date from the 16th and 17th centuries. The last statue in the procession is the Virgen de las Angustias, and her return to the church is one of the most emotional moments of the celebrations, with the Salve Popular sung in her honour.

Easter is one of the most spectacular and emotional fiestas here. Religious devotion, art, colour and music combine in acts to commemorate the death of Jesus Christ: the processions. Members of the different Easter brotherhoods, dressed in their characteristic robes, parade through the streets carrying religious statues (pasos) to the sound of drums and music – scenes of sober beauty.
