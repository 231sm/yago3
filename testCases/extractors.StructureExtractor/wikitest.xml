'''St John's College''' is a [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|constituent college]] of the [[University of Oxford]], one of the larger Oxford colleges with approximately 390 undergraduates, 200 postgraduates and over 100 academic staff.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/343/About_St-John%27s.html&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1555 by Sir [[Thomas White (merchant)|Thomas White]], a merchant. St. John's is reputed to be the wealthiest in Oxford, with a [[financial endowment]] of £313 million as of 2010&lt;ref name=&quot;2010finances&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://d307gmaoxpdmsg.cloudfront.net/collegeaccounts0910/St_Johns.pdf |title=Report and Financial Statements |author= St John's College, Oxford |date=31 July 2011 |accessdate=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==History==
On 1 May 1555, [[Thomas White (merchant)|Sir Thomas White]], lately [[Lord Mayor of London]], obtained a Royal Patent of Foundation to create an eleemosynary institution for the education of students within the University of Oxford. White, a [[Roman Catholic]], originally intended St John's to provide a source of educated Roman Catholic clerics to support the Counter-Reformation under [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]], and indeed [[Edmund Campion]], the Roman Catholic martyr, studied here.

White acquired buildings on the east side of [[St Giles', Oxford|St Giles']], north of [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] and [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity]] Colleges, which had belonged to the former College of St Bernard, a monastery and house of study of the [[Cistercian]] order that had been closed during the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. Initially the new St John's College was rather small and not well endowed financially. During the reign of Elizabeth I the fellows lectured in rhetoric, Greek, and dialectic, but not directly in theology. However, St John's initially had a strong focus on the creation of a proficient and educated priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, Charles Bernard (1983) ''John Case and Aristotelianism in Renaissance England''. Kingston [Ont.] : McGill-Queen's University Press ISBN 0773510052&lt;/ref&gt;

White was Master of the [[Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors|Merchant Taylors' Company]], and established a number of educational foundations, including the [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]]. Although the College was closely linked to such institutions for many centuries, it became a more open society in the later 19th century. (Closed scholarships for students from the Merchant Taylors' School, however, persisted until the late 20th century.) The endowments which St John's was given at its foundation, and during the twenty or so years afterward, served it very well and in the second half of the nineteenth century it benefited, as ground landlord, from the suburban development of the city of [[Oxford]] and was unusual among Colleges for the size and extent of its property within the city.

Although primarily a producer of Anglican clergymen in the earlier periods of its history, St John's also gained a reputation for both law and medicine. Fellows and alumni have included Archbishop [[William Laud]], [[Jane Austen]]'s father and brothers, the early [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] intellectual [[Sidney Ball]], who was very influential in the creation of the [[Workers' Educational Association]] (WEA), [[Rushanara Ali]], Labour Politician and one of the first [[Bangladeshis]] to gain a PPE degree at St. John's College and more recently, [[Tony Blair]], former prime minister of the United Kingdom.

The patronage of the parish of St Giles was included in the endowment of the college by Thomas White. Vicars of St Giles were formerly either Fellows of the College, or ex-Fellows who were granted the living on marriage (when Oxford fellows were required to be unmarried). The College retains the right to present candidates for the benefice to the bishop.&lt;ref&gt;Kettler, Sarah Valente &amp; Trimble, Carole (2003) ''The Amateur Historian's Guide to the Heart of England''. Sterling, Va.:  Capital Books 1892123657&lt;/ref&gt;

== Student Life ==

=== Facilities ===

Unusually amongst Oxford colleges, St John's offers onsite accommodation to all undergraduates for the duration of their course (although students are not obliged to take up this offer). For first years, this is mostly in the Thomas White Quad, with some students accommodated in the Beehive.

=== College societies ===

The St John's College Boat Club is the largest college society; everybody is encouraged to try out the sport. In [[Summer Eights]] 2011, six SJCBC boats qualified for the racing, and both the Women's and Men's First Boat Won &quot;Blades&quot; (bumping the boat in front on each day of racing), making SJCBC one of the most successful boathouses on the river.

In 2006 St John's launched SJCtv, becoming the first Oxford college to start its own television station.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sjctv.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; The station shows two half-hour programmes a term, at college welfare nights. SJCtv's stated aim is to enhance community spirit, inform students of the college's welfare provisions and allow students a forum for creative expression.

St John's used to be the home of two dining societies, the King Charles Club (&quot;KCC&quot;) and the Archery Club. Tony Blair has been pictured at a gathering of the latter in the St John's gardens.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-439587/Blair-boater-crude-hand-gesture-Class-75.html&lt;/ref&gt;In recent years these societies have become largely defunct although are still celebrated by former members.

The college also has an active drama group, who operate under the banner of St. John's Mummers. They produce one performance per term, ranging from modern &quot;in-yer-face&quot; to Shakespearean garden plays. In 2010 they performed an adaptation of [[Alfred Jarry]]'s [[Ubu Roi]], called &quot;Ubu&quot; at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] under the name &quot;Awful Pie Theatre.&quot;

SASJO (the St John's and [[St Anne's College, Oxford|St Anne's]] Orchestra) both performs (every term) and rehearses in the St John's Auditorium. The orchestra is non-audition and open to all University of Oxford students, regardless of college.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sasjo.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

==College buildings==
[[Image:st johns college oxford.jpg|thumb|right|Canterbury Quad, St John's College, Oxford : The entrance to the Great Lawn and Groves, which were not, despite popular legend, landscaped by [[Capability Brown]]]]

The college is situated on a single large site. Most of the college buildings are organized around seven quadrangles (quads):
*Front Quadrangle: mainly the 15th-century buildings of the former St Bernard's monastery.
*Canterbury Quadrangle: the first example of Italian [[Renaissance architecture]] in Oxford, substantially commissioned by Archbishop Laud and completed in 1636&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/3766/St%20John%20the%20College%20and%20the%20Merchant%20Taylors.pdf.download |title=St. John, the College and the Merchant Taylors’ Company |author= Mr Michael Riordan |date=24 June 2011 |accessdate=24 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Much of the college library is here, including the Old Library on the south side, and the Laudian Library above the eastern colonnade, overlooking the garden.
*North Quadrangle: an irregularly-shaped mixture of 18th, 19th, and 20th century ranges. These include the 18th-century buttery staircase adjoining the hall, the block containing the Senior Common Room, the 19th-century range along [[St Giles', Oxford|St Giles']], and the &quot;Beehive&quot; (1958–60), made up of non-regular hexagonal rooms. The Senior Common Room ceiling, completed in 1742, features the craftsmanship of Thomas Roberts, who also worked on the [[Radcliffe Camera]] and the [[Codrington Library]].&lt;ref&gt;Tyack, Geoffrey (1998) ''Oxford: An Architectural Guide''. Oxford University Press, 1998 ISBN 0198174233&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dolphin Quadrangle: built in the early 20th century on the site of the old Dolphin Inn.
*Sir Thomas White Quadrangle: late 20th century (informally known as &quot;Tommy White Quad&quot;). The building is an early work by [[Ove Arup]] which won the 1976 Concrete Society Award, but is considered a monstrosity by many members of the college. It is not actually a quadrangle, but an L-shaped building partially enclosing an area of garden.
*Garden Quadrangle: a modern (1993) neo-Italianate quadrangle including an auditorium and other conference facilities by [[MJP Architects]].
*Kendrew Quadrangle: the most recent quad, completed in 2010.

Other buildings on the site include the Holmes Building (a south spur off the Canterbury Quad, containing fellows' rooms), and Middleton Hall, a curious house, north of the North Quad and abutting the [[Lamb &amp; Flag (Oxford)|Lamb and Flag]], which has a stone frontage in early 19th-century style, though the back part is in Victorian red brick and contains a Jacobean staircase (perhaps originally from another building).

In addition, the College accommodates a number of students, traditionally second-year undergraduates but nowadays also a significant number of final year undergraduates and graduate students, in the houses owned by the college on [[Museum Road]] and [[Blackhall Road]]. These houses back onto Kendrew Quadrangle, completed in October 2010, named after  [[John Kendrew|Sir John Kendrew]], former President of the College, Nobel Laureate and the College's greatest benefactor of the twentieth century. This construction has been dubbed &quot;the last great quad in the city centre&quot; and is notable for its attempt to provide energy from sustainable sources: much of the energy required to heat the building is provided by a combination of solar panels on the roof, geothermal pipes extending deep below the basement and woodchips from the College wood used to fire the boilers.

As the first phase of The Kendrew Quadrangle project Dunthorne Parker Architects were appointed by the College to refurbish three Grade II Listed buildings fronting on to St Giles. Works were carried out to No 20 St Giles which became alumni residential accommodation, The Black Hall, a 17th century building, which became teaching accommodation and The Barn, which became an exhibition and performance space. This project was awarded an Oxford Preservation Trust Plaque in 2008.  

Since the College also incorporates Middleton Hall (see above) and owns St Giles House, the former judge's house north of the college, the opening of Kendrew Quadrangle mean that the College extends for almost the entire length of the east side of St Giles, as well as owning parts of the opposite side. This includes the [[The Eagle and Child]] pub (where the well-known writers [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and [[C. S. Lewis]] often met their literary friends), complementing the [[Lamb &amp; Flag (Oxford)|Lamb and Flag]] opposite it on the College side of the road, which the College owns and operates (using the profits to fund graduate scholarships).

The [[Senior Common Room|SCR]] was renovated and extended in 2004 and 2005 by [[MJP Architects]]. The new building was given an award by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] in 2006.

'''Anthony Charles Lynton &lt;!-- Please do not add 'Tony' here as it is obvious information, and ugly to interrupt the full name at this point --&gt;Blair''' (born 6 May 1953)&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Tony Blair| url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9003134 | work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[British people|British]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician who served as the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister of the]] [[United Kingdom]] from 2 May 1997 to 27 June 2007. He was the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Sedgefield (UK Parliament constituency)|Sedgefield]] from 1983 to 2007 and [[List of United Kingdom Labour Party leaders|Leader of the Labour Party]] from 1994 to 2007. He resigned from all of these positions in June 2007.

Blair was elected Leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1994|leadership election of July 1994]], following the sudden death of his predecessor, [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]]. Under his leadership, the party used the phrases &quot;[[New Labour]]&quot; and &quot;New Socialism&quot; to define its policy, and moved away from its support of [[state socialism]] since the 1960s and created a new version of the [[ethical socialism]] that was last pursued by [[Clement Attlee]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bevir. ''New Labour: a critique''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2005. Pp. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of Blair claim that &quot;New Labour&quot; did not adhere to socialism as claimed, and that it effectively advocated [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Florence Faucher-King, Patrick Le Galès, Gregory Elliott. The New Labour experiment: change and reform under Blair and Brown. Stanford, California, USA: Stanford University Press, 2010. Pp. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Blair subsequently led Labour to a landslide victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]]. At 43 years old, he became the youngest Prime Minister since [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] in 1812. In the first years of the New Labour government, Blair's government implemented a number of [[New Labour, New Life For Britain|1997 manifesto]] pledges, introducing the [[National Minimum Wage Act 1998|minimum wage]], [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]] and [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]], and carrying out [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution]], establishing the [[Scottish Parliament]], the [[National Assembly for Wales]], and the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]].

Blair's role as Prime Minister was particularly visible in foreign and security policy, including in [[Northern Ireland]], where he was involved in the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]]. From the start of the [[War on Terror]] in 2001, Blair strongly supported the foreign policy of US President [[George W. Bush]], notably by participating in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Blair is the Labour Party's longest-serving Prime Minister, the only person to have led the Labour Party to three consecutive general election victories, and the only Labour Prime Minister to serve consecutive terms more than one of which was at least four years long.

He was succeeded as Leader of the Labour Party on 24 June 2007 and as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007 by [[Gordon Brown]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown is UK's new prime minister&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Brown is UK's new prime minister |work=BBC News  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6245682.stm |date=27 June 2007 |accessdate=27 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day he resigned as Prime Minister, he was appointed the official Envoy of the [[Quartet on the Middle East]]. In May 2008, Blair launched his [[Tony Blair Faith Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7427809.stm |title=Blair launches faith foundation |publisher=BBC News  |date=30 May 2008 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in July 2009 by the launching of the ''[[Faith and Globalisation initiative|Faith and Globalisation Initiative]]'' with Yale University in the US, [[Durham University]] in the UK and the [[National University of Singapore]] in Asia to deliver a postgraduate programme in partnership with the Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tony Blair launches Faith and Globalisation programme at Durham University |url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/news/newsitem/?itemno=8243|accessdate=13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Yale and Tony Blair Launch Faith and Globalization Initiative |url=http://opa.yale.edu/news/article.aspx?id=6040|publisher=Yale University Office of Public Affairs|accessdate=13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and family life==
Blair was born in Edinburgh, Scotland&lt;ref name=&quot;Edinburgh Evening-birthplace&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Blair's birthplace is bulldozed in Edinburgh | url = http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1156262006 | work=[[Edinburgh Evening News]] | publisher=Johnston Press plc |date=9 August 2006| accessdate =18 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 6 May 1953,&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt; the second son of [[Leo Blair (senior)|Leo]] and Hazel Blair (''née'' Corscadden). Leo Blair, the illegitimate&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2000/dec/21/adoptionandfostering.localgovernment1 Blair: 'Why adoption is close to my heart'], 21 December 2000, ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; son of two English actors, had been adopted as a baby by Glasgow shipyard worker James Blair and his wife, Mary. Hazel Corscadden was the daughter of George Corscadden, a butcher and [[Orange Order|Orangeman]] who moved to Glasgow in 1916 but returned to (and later died in) [[Ballyshannon]] in 1923, where his wife, Sarah Margaret (née Lipsett), gave birth to Blair's mother, Hazel, above her family's grocery shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ballyshannon.ie/Article_Listings.aspx?tscategory_id=276&amp;category_name=Local+Map |title= Local Map |publisher=[[Ballyshannon]] Town Council |accessdate=22 November 2007 |quote=Lipsett's Grocery Shop: This is the birthplace of Hazel (Corscadden) Blair, mother of British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

===Life as a child===
Blair has one elder brother, [[William Blair (judge)|Sir William Blair]], a [[High Court]] judge, and a younger sister, Sarah. Blair spent the first 19 months of his life at the family home in Paisley Terrace in the Willowbrae area of Edinburgh. During this period, his father worked as a junior tax inspector whilst also studying for a law degree from the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edinburgh Evening-birthplace&quot;/&gt; In the 1950s, his family spent three and a half years in Adelaide, Australia, where his father was a lecturer in law at the [[University of Adelaide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Tony's big adventure | url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/secondterm/story/0,8224,944191,00.html|work=The Observer |location=UK | publisher=Guardian Newspapers Ltd. |date=27 April 2003 | accessdate =18 November 2006  | first=Kamal | last=Ahmed}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blairs lived close to the university, in the suburb of [[Dulwich, South Australia|Dulwich]]. The family returned to the UK in the late 1950s, living for a time with Hazel Blair's stepfather, William McClay, and her mother at their home in [[Stepps]], near Glasgow. He spent the remainder of his childhood in [[Durham]], England, where his father lectured at [[Durham University]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Education===
After attending [[Chorister School, Durham|The Chorister School]] in [[Durham]] from 1961 to 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thechoristerschool.com/alumni/rollcall.php |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071021173809/http://www.thechoristerschool.com/alumni/rollcall.php |archivedate=21 October 2007 |title=Alumni Roll Call |work=Durham Chorister School website |accessdate=22 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair boarded at [[Fettes College]], a prestigious independent school in Edinburgh, during which time he met [[Charles Falconer, Baron Falconer of Thoroton|Charlie Falconer]] (a pupil at the rival [[Edinburgh Academy]]), whom he later appointed [[Lord Chancellor]]. He reportedly modelled himself on [[Mick Jagger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1678432,00.html |title=Tony Blair absolutely modelled himself on Mick Jagger |author=Victoria Powell |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=6 January 2006 |accessdate=22 November 2007 |quote=TV producer Victoria Powell explains how she recreated the PM's adventures in 1970s rock }}&lt;/ref&gt; His teachers were unimpressed with him, his biographer [[John Rentoul (journalist)|John Rentoul]], reported that &quot;All the teachers I spoke to when researching the book said he was a complete pain in the backside and they were very glad to see the back of him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/edwardblack/Tony-Blairs-revolting-schooldays.2548089.jp |title=Tony Blair's revolting schooldays |author=Ed Black's diary |work=The Scotsman |location=Edinburgh |date=23 July 2004 |accessdate=22 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair was arrested at Fettes, having been mistaken for a burglar as he climbed into his dormitory using a ladder after having been out late.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Blair in a boater, a crude hand gesture, and the Class of '75 | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=439587&amp;in_page_id=1770&amp;ico=Homepage&amp;icl=TabModule&amp;icc=picbox&amp;ct=5|work=Daily Mail |location=UK | publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd. |date=3 March 2006 | accessdate =8 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Cherie Blair.jpg|left|thumb|Tony Blair's wife, [[Cherie Blair|Cherie Booth]], [[Queen's Counsel|QC]].]]
After Fettes, Blair spent a year in London, where he attempted to find fame as a rock music promoter before reading [[jurisprudence]] at [[St John's College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Michaelmas Term 1974 | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | series=Complete Alphabetical List of the Resident Members of the University of Oxford | year=1974 | page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a student, he played guitar and sang in a rock band called [[Ugly Rumours (band)|Ugly Rumours]]. During this time, he dated future ''[[American Psycho]]'' director [[Mary Harron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800256658/bio
| title = Mary Harron Biography| accessdate =18 November 2006| year = 2006 | work=Yahoo! Movies| publisher=Yahoo! Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was influenced by fellow student and Anglican priest [[Peter Thomson (priest)|Peter Thomson]], who awakened within Blair a deep concern for religious faith and left-wing politics. While Blair was at Oxford, his mother Hazel died of cancer, which greatly affected him. After graduating from Oxford in 1975 with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|Second Class Honours]] BA in Jurisprudence, Blair became a member of [[Lincoln's Inn]], enrolled as a pupil barrister, and met his future wife, [[Cherie Blair|Cherie Booth]] (daughter of the actor [[Antony Booth|Tony Booth]]) at the law chambers founded by [[Derry Irvine, Baron Irvine of Lairg|Derry Irvine]] (who was to be Blair's first Lord Chancellor), [[11 King's Bench Walk Chambers]]. He appears in a number of reported cases, for example as in ''[[Nethermere (St Neots) Ltd v Gardiner]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Nethermere (St Neots) Ltd v Gardiner]]'' [1983] ICR 319&lt;/ref&gt; where he represented employers unsuccessfully in an attempt to deny female factory workers holiday pay.

===Marriage and children===
Blair married [[Cherie Booth]], a Roman Catholic and future [[Queen's Counsel]], on 29 March 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cherieblair.org/highlights/2010/03/my-memory-is-not-infallible.html |title=Events &amp; Visits &amp;#124; Cherie celebrates her 30th Wedding Anniversary this spring |publisher=Cherie Blair |accessdate=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have four children: Euan, Nicholas, Kathryn, and Leo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/05/10/blair.facts/index.html CNN.com] Facts: Life and times of Tony Blair&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/822238.stm |title=Blair's son 'drunk and incapable' |publisher=BBC News  |date=6 July 2000 |accessdate=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leo, delivered by the Royal Surgeon/Gynaecologist [[Marcus Setchell]], was the first legitimate child born to a serving Prime Minister in over 150 years—since Francis Russell was born to [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] on 11 July 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/756400.stm |title=Welcome distraction for Tony Blair |publisher=BBC News  |date=20 May 2000 |accessdate=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair was criticised when it was discovered that one child had received private tuition from staff at [[Westminster School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/blair-caught-up-in-private-tutor-row-647334.html |title=Blair caught up in private tutor row |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=5 July 2002 |accessdate=20 April 2010 | first1=Marie | last1=Woolf | first2=Richard | last2=Garner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal health===
Blair suffered from chest pains on Sunday 19 October 2003 and underwent a [[cardioversion]] at [[Hammersmith Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;Wintour, Patrick; Boseley Sarah. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2003/oct/20/labour.politics Tony Blair in heart scare], ''The Guardian'', 20 October 2003. Retrieved 18 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious faith===
In an interview with [[Michael Parkinson]] broadcast on [[ITV1]] on 4 March 2006, Blair referred to the role of his Christian faith in his decision to go to war in Iraq, stating that he had prayed about the issue, and saying that God would judge him for his decision: &quot;I think if you have faith about these things, you realise that judgement is made by other people … and if you believe in God, it's made by God as well.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Blair 'prayed to God' over Iraq | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4772142.stm |publisher=BBC News  |date=3 March 2006 | accessdate =18 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A longer exploration of his faith can be found in an interview with ''[[Third Way Magazine]]''. There he says that &quot;I was brought up as [a Christian], but I was not in any real sense a practising one until I went to Oxford. There was an Australian priest at the same college as me who got me interested again. In a sense, it was a rediscovery of religion as something living, that was about the world around me rather than some sort of special one-to-one relationship with a remote Being on high. Suddenly I began to see its social relevance. I began to make sense of the world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thirdway.org.uk/past/showpage.asp?page=43 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927142102/http://www.thirdway.org.uk/past/showpage.asp?page=43 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |title=Practising for Power: Tony Blair  |author=Roy McCloughry |work=[[Third Way Magazine]]: the modern world through Christian eyes |date=14 September 1993 |accessdate=22 November 2007 |quote=Since 1993, Third Way has been talking in depth to men and women who help to shape our society or set the tone of our culture. We spoke to Tony Blair on 14 September 1993, before the spin doctors closed around him, when he was still shadow Home Secretary and had a full head of hair.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point [[Alastair Campbell]], Blair's director of strategy and communications, intervened in an interview, preventing the Prime Minister from answering a question about his Christianity, explaining, &quot;We don't do God&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1429109/Campbell-interrupted-Blair-as-he-spoke-of-his-faith-We-dont-do-God.html|title=Campbell interrupted Blair as he spoke of his faith: 'We don't do God' |author=Colin Brown |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=3 May 2003 |accessdate=28 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cherie Blair's friend and &quot;spiritual guru&quot; [[Carole Caplin]] is credited with introducing her and her husband to various [[New Age]] symbols and beliefs, including &quot;magic pendants&quot; known as &quot;BioElectric Shields&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,6903,856064,00.html &quot;Ev'rybody must get stones&quot;], The Observer, 8 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The most controversial of the Blairs' New Age practices occurred when on holiday in Mexico. The couple, wearing only bathing costumes, took part in a rebirthing procedure, which involved smearing mud and fruit over each others' bodies while sitting in a steam bath.&lt;ref&gt;''How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered the World'', [[Francis Wheen]], Harper Perennial 2004, ISBN 0-00-714097-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on, Blair questioned the Pope's attitude towards homosexuality, arguing that religious leaders must start &quot;rethinking&quot; the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7987566.stm |title=Blair questions Papal gay policy |publisher=BBC News  |date=8 April 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later rebuked by [[Vincent Nichols]], the new archbishop of Westminster, who said that Catholic thinking was 'rather different' from the kind promoted by the former prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Steve Doughty |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1169204/Catholic-leaders-rebuke-Blair.html |title=Catholic leader's rebuke for Blair |work=The Daily Mail |date=4 November 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 December 2007, it was disclosed that Blair, who in 1996, had been reprimanded by Cardinal [[Basil Hume]] for receiving [[Holy Communion]] at Mass despite not being a Catholic, in contravention of canon law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,2082533,00.html |title=Blair doesn't need intermediaries to communicate with God.

The Pope and his advisors criticised some of Blair's political actions, but followed up with a reportedly unprecedented red-carpet welcome, which included Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster [[Cormac Murphy-O'Connor]], who would be responsible for Blair's [[Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults|Catholic instruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article1801237.ece |title=Blair will be welcomed into Catholic fold via his ‘baptism of desire’ |author=Ruth Gledhill, Jeremy Austin and Philip Webster |work=The Times |location=UK |date=17 May 2007 |accessdate=22 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 January 2009, Blair, upon a visit to the British Embassy in Washington, D.C., described, in the guest book, his home as being 'Jerusalem'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Walters | first = Simon | title = An identity crisis for Blair: Former PM describes Jerusalem as 'home' |work=Daily Mail |location=UK | date = 12 April 2007 | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1169342/An-identity-crisis-Blair-Former-PM-describes-Jerusalem-home.html | accessdate =15 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed shortly after, on the occasion of his addressing of the National Prayer Breakfast, by his discussion of the issue of religion in the world and the Middle East peace process in his address and how he spends so much of his time in the Holy Land and in the Holy City. He reported his Palestinian guide as bemoaning the fate of his nation looking to heaven and saying “Moses, Jesus, Mohammed: why did they all have to come here?&quot; For Blair the Holy City is &quot;a good place to reflect on religion: a source of so much inspiration; an excuse for so much evil.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/8558 |title=Tony Blair addresses Obama's first annual National Prayer Breakfast |publisher=Ekklesia|date=5 February 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Alastair Campbell's diary, Blair often read the Bible before taking any important decisions. He states that Blair had a &quot;wobble&quot; and considered changing his mind on the eve of the [[Bombing of Iraq (December 1998)|bombing of Iraq in 1998]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/jan/14/tony-blair-alastair-campbell-diaries Alastair Campbell diaries: How Blair's Bible reading prompted Iraq 'wobble'] guardian.co.uk, Friday 14 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==
Blair joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] shortly after graduating from Oxford in 1975. During the early 1980s, he was involved in Labour politics in [[Hackney South and Shoreditch (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney South and Shoreditch]], where he aligned himself with the &quot;[[soft left]]&quot; of the party.  In 1982 Blair was selected as the Labour candidate in the safe [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] seat of [[Beaconsfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Beaconsfield]], where there was a forthcoming by-election. Although Blair lost the [[Beaconsfield by-election, 1982|Beaconsfield by-election]] (the only election he lost in his 25-year political career) he gained 10% of the vote and acquired a profile within the party. In contrast to his later centrism, Blair made it clear in a letter he wrote to Labour leader Michael Foot in July 1982, that he had &quot;come to Socialism through Marxism&quot; and considered himself on the left. The letter was eventually published in June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Tony | last = Blair | title = The full text of Tony Blair's letter to Michael Foot written in July 1982 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/06/16/nletter116.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2006/06/16/ixuknews.html  | work=The Daily Telegraph | publisher=Telegraph Media Group Ltd. |date = July 1982| accessdate =18 November 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Blair found the newly created [[Sedgefield (UK Parliament constituency)|constituency of Sedgefield]], a notionally safe Labour seat near where he had grown up in [[Durham]]. The branch had not made a nomination, and Blair visited them. Several sitting MPs displaced by boundary changes were interested in securing selection to fight the seat. With the crucial support of [[John Burton (political agent)|John Burton]], Blair won their endorsement; at the last minute, he was added to the short list and won the selection over [[Les Huckfield]]. Burton later became Blair's [[Election agent|agent]] and one of his most trusted and longest-standing allies.

Blair's election literature in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 UK general election]] endorsed left-wing policies that Labour advocated in the early 1980s. He called for Britain to leave the [[European Economic Community|EEC]], though he had told his selection conference that he personally favoured continuing membership. He also supported [[nuclear disarmament|unilateral nuclear disarmament]] as a member of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]. Blair was helped on the campaign trail by soap opera actress [[Pat Phoenix]], his father-in-law's girlfriend. Blair was elected as MP for Sedgefield despite the party's landslide defeat in the general election.

In his [[maiden speech]] in the House of Commons on 6 July 1983, Blair stated, &quot;I am a socialist not through reading a textbook that has caught my intellectual fancy, nor through unthinking tradition, but because I believe that, at its best, socialism corresponds most closely to an existence that is both rational and moral. It stands for cooperation, not confrontation; for fellowship, not fear. It stands for equality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2006/4/20/170221.shtml | title = On Democracy | accessdate =18 November 2006| last = Navrozov | first = Lev |date=21 April 2006 | work=NewsMax.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.logosjournal.com/issue_3.4/seddon.htm | title = America's Friend: Reflections on Tony Blair| accessdate =18 November 2006| last = Seddon| first = Mark | year = 2004| work=Logos 3.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour Party is declared in its constitution to be a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] party&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.labour.org.uk/aboutlabour|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061116065904/http://www.labour.org.uk/aboutlabour|archivedate = 16 November 2006| title = About Labour| accessdate =18 November 2006| year = 2006| publisher=The Labour Party}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than a [[social democratic]] party; Blair himself organised this declaration of Labour to be a socialist party when he dealt with the change to the party's [[Clause IV]] in their constitution.

Once elected, Blair's political ascent was rapid. He received his first front-bench appointment in 1984 as assistant Treasury spokesman. In May 1985, he appeared on BBC's [[Question Time]], arguing that the Conservative Government's Public Order White Paper was a threat to civil liberties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/programme/LCAQ520E |title=BBC Archive |publisher=BBC Programme Catalogue|accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Blair demanded an inquiry into the [[Bank of England]]'s decision to rescue the collapsed [[Johnson Matthey]] Bank in October 1985 and embarrassed the government by finding a EEC report critical of British economic policy that had been countersigned by a member of the Conservative government.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} By this time, Blair was aligned with the reforming tendencies in the party (headed by leader [[Neil Kinnock]]) and was promoted after the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 election]] to the shadow Trade and Industry team as spokesman on the [[City of London]]. In 1987, he stood for election to the [[Shadow Cabinet]], receiving 71 votes.&lt;ref&gt;John Carvel, &quot;A fresh team of 'Yaks' will take on Labour's burden&quot;, ''The Guardian'', 9 July 1987, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blair became [[Shadow Home Secretary]] under [[John Smith (UK politician)|John Smith]]. John Smith died suddenly in 1994 of a heart attack. Blair beat [[John Prescott]] and [[Margaret Beckett]] in the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1994|subsequent leadership election]] and became [[Leader of the Opposition (UK)|Leader of the Opposition]]. As is customary for the holder of that office, Blair was appointed a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillor]].

===Leader of the Labour Party===
Blair announced at the end of his speech at the 1994 Labour Party conference that he intended to replace [[Clause IV]] of the party's constitution with a new statement of aims and values. This involved the deletion of the party's stated commitment to &quot;the common ownership of the means of production and exchange&quot;, which was widely interpreted as referring to wholesale nationalisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s 326&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher=Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0465041957|page= 326|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a special conference in April 1995, the clause was replaced by a statement that the party is 'democratic socialist'.&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s 326&quot;/&gt;

He inherited the Labour leadership at a time when the party was ascendant over the Tories in the opinion polls since the Tory government's reputation for monetary excellence was left in tatters by the [[Black Wednesday]] economic disaster of September 1992. Blair's election as leader saw Labour support surge higher still&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393323.stm |work=BBC News  | title=1997: Labour landslide ends Tory rule | date=15 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; in spite of the continuing economic recovery and fall in unemployment that the Conservative government (led by [[John Major]]) had overseen since the end of the 1990–92 [[Early 1990s recession|recession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393323.stm | work=BBC News | title=1997: Labour landslide ends Tory rule | date=15 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1996 Labour Party conference, Blair stated that his three top priorities on coming to office were &quot;education, education, and education&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6564933.stm &quot;Education, education, education&quot;] BBC News,14 May 2007. Retrieved 8 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aided by the unpopularity of [[John Major]]'s Conservative government (itself deeply divided over the European Union), &quot;New Labour&quot; won a landslide victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], ending 18 years of Conservative Party government, with the heaviest Conservative defeat since [[United Kingdom general election, 1832|1832]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Kingdom|title=Government and Politics in Britain: An Introduction|publisher=Polity Press|edition=3rd|month=April|year=2003|isbn=978-0745625942|page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Smith's leadership of the Labour Party, there were discussions with [[Paddy Ashdown]], the leader of the [[Liberal Democrats]], about forming a [[coalition]] government if the next general election resulted in a [[hung parliament]]. After Blair became leader, these talks continued – despite virtually every opinion poll since late 1992 having shown Labour with enough support to form a majority. However, the scale of the Labour victory meant that there was ultimately never any need for a coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epolitix.com/latestnews/article-detail/newsarticle/top-ten-lib-dem-breakthrough-moments/ |title=Top Ten: Lib Dem 'breakthrough moments' |publisher=ePolitix.com |date=24 April 2010 |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prime Minister==
{{Main|Premiership of Tony Blair}}

Blair became the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] on [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|2 May 1997]], serving concurrently as [[First Lord of the Treasury]], [[Minister for the Civil Service]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]]. The 43-year old Blair became the youngest person to become Prime Minister since [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] in 1812, at the age of 42.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/page4.asp| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070604003655/http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/page4.asp| archivedate = 4 June 2007| title = Biography: The Prime Minister Tony Charles Lynton Blair| accessdate =18 November 2006| publisher=Prime Minister's Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; With victories in 1997, [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001]], and [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005]], Blair was the Labour Party's longest-serving prime minister, the only person to lead the party to three consecutive general election victories.

===Northern Ireland===
[[Image:TonyBlairArmagh1998.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Blair addressing a crowd in [[Armagh]] in 1998.]]
His contribution towards assisting the [[Northern Ireland Peace Process]] by helping to negotiate the [[Good Friday Agreement]] (after 30 years of conflict) was widely recognised.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News Archive, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/10/newsid_2450000/2450823.stm &quot;1998: Northern Ireland peace deal reached&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Stephens, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/36fa51da-fe30-11db-bdc7-000b5df10621.html &quot;Blair’s remarkable record&quot;], ''Financial Times'', 10 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Omagh Bombing]] on 15 August 1998, by members of the [[Real IRA]] opposed to the peace process, which killed 29 people and wounded hundreds, Blair visited the [[County Tyrone]] town and met with victims at [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast]].&lt;ref&gt;Telegraph.co.uk: ''Omagh, Northern Ireland's worst atrocity'' 24 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===War on Terror===
In his first six years in office Blair ordered British troops into battle five times, more than any other prime minister in British history. This included Iraq in both [[Bombing of Iraq (December 1998)|1998]] and [[Iraq War|2003]]; [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]] (1999); [[Sierra Leone Civil War|Sierra Leone]] (2000) and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] (2001).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/6361771.stm Blair: The Inside Story] [[BBC News]], 22 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

From the start of the [[War on Terror]] in 2001, Blair strongly supported the [[Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration|foreign policy]] of [[George W. Bush]], participating in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. The invasion of Iraq was particularly controversial, as it attracted widespread public opposition and 139 of Blair's MPs opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-10518842 |work=BBC News  | title=The rise and fall of New Labour | date=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he faced criticism over the policy itself and the circumstances in which it was decided upon. [[Alastair Campbell]] described Blair's statement that the intelligence on WMDs was &quot;beyond doubt&quot; as his &quot;assessment of the assessment that was given to him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by satirist [[Armando Ianucci]] and called his 'favourite sentence of the Inquiry so far' Radio 5 Live 21 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Blair stated that he would have supported removing Saddam Hussein from power even in the face of proof that he had no such weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Riazat Butt and Richard Norton-Taylor |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/dec/12/tony-blair-iraq-chilcot-inquiry |title=Tony Blair admits: I would have invaded Iraq anyway |work=Guardian |date=12 December 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playwright [[Harold Pinter]] and former Malaysian Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohammad]] accused Blair of war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-08/01/content_8890239.htm |title=Malaysian former PM Mahathir accuses Tony Blair as war criminal|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|date=1 August 2008 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=David Fickling |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/dec/07/iraq.booksnews |title=Pinter demands war crimes trial for Blair|work=The Guardian |date= 7 December 2005|accessdate=20 April 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testifying before the [[Iraq Inquiry]] on 29 January 2010, Blair said Saddam was a &quot;monster and I believe he threatened not just the region but the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8485694.stm|title=Iraq inquiry hears defiant Blair say: I'd do it again|publisher=BBC News |date=29 January 2010|accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Blair said that British and American attitude towards Saddam Hussein had &quot;changed dramatically&quot; after 11 September attacks.

===Relationship with Parliament===
One of his first acts as Prime Minister was to replace the then twice-weekly 15-minute sessions of [[Prime Minister's Questions]] held on Tuesdays and Thursdays with a single 30-minute session on Wednesdays. In addition to PMQs, Blair held monthly press conferences at which he fielded questions from journalists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page3347.asp | title = PM: Saddam and his regime will be removed| accessdate =21 November 2006|date=25 March 2003| work=Prime Minister's Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Matthew | last = Tempest | title = Tony Blair's press conference | url = http://politics.guardian.co.uk/media/story/0,,1299024,00.html | work=The Guardian | publisher=Guardian Newspapers Ltd. |date=7 September 2004 | accessdate =21 November 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and – from 2002 – broke precedent by agreeing to give evidence twice yearly before the most senior Commons select committee, The Liaison Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1392335/Blair-agrees-to-face-grilling-by-select-committee-critics.html &quot;Blair agrees to face grilling by select committee critics&quot;] Daily Telegraph, 27 April 2002.

===Events prior to resignation===
As the [[casualties of the Iraq War]] mounted, Blair was accused of misleading Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2003/nov/08/20031108-111529-7094r/ Blair a casualty of UK support for Iraq war], ''[[The Washington Times]]'', 8 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/diplomats-suppressed-document-lays-bare-the-lies-behind-iraq-war-428545.html Diplomat's suppressed document lays bare the lies behind Iraq war], ''The Independent'', 15 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and his popularity dropped dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10102727 Blair Risked Much in Support of U.S.-UK Friendship], [[National Public Radio]], 9 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1422365/Talk-of-war-dents-Blairs-popularity.html Talk of war dents Blair's popularity], ''Daily Telegraph'', 17 February 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour party's overall majority in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]] was reduced to 66.
As a combined result of the [[Blair-Brown pact]], Iraq war and low approval ratings, pressure built up within the Labour party for Blair to resign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=2405434&amp;page=1 Tony Blair to Resign in a Year], [[ABC News]], 7 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,482199,00.html The End of the Tony Show], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 10 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 September 2006, Blair publicly stated he would step down as party leader by the time of the [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC) conference held 10–13 September 2007,&lt;ref name=&quot;iwillquit&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title = I will quit within a year —Blair| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5322094.stm|publisher=BBC News |date=7 September 2006| accessdate =18 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; having promised to serve a full term during the previous general election campaign. On 10 May 2007, during a speech at the Trimdon Labour Club, Blair announced his intention to resign as both Labour Party leader and Prime Minister. At a special party conference in [[Manchester]] on 24 June 2007, he formally handed over the leadership of the Labour Party to [[Gordon Brown]], who had been [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown is UK's new prime minister&quot;/&gt; Blair tendered his resignation on 27 June 2007 and his successor, Gordon Brown assumed office the same afternoon.

Blair has rarely applied such labels to himself, but he promised before the 1997 election that New Labour would govern &quot;from the radical centre&quot;, and according to one lifelong Labour Party member, has always described himself as a [[social democracy|social democrat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hulver.com/scoop/story/2007/5/17/73955/4678 &quot;The Death of Socialism&quot;], 17 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, Labour Party backbenchers and other left wing critics typically place Blair to the [[right of centre]].&lt;ref&gt;Neal Lawson, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,2060360,00.html &quot;A decade of Blair has left the Labour party on its knees&quot;], ''The Guardian'', 19 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A [[YouGov]] opinion poll in 2005 also found that a small majority of British voters, including many New Labour supporters, place Blair on the right of the political spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;YouGov UK Polling Report, [http://www.ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/30 ''Left vs Right''], 23 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kellner, [http://www.newstatesman.com/200210280019 &quot;What's left of the Labour leader?&quot;], ''New Stateman'', 28 October 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Financial Times]]'' on the other hand has argued that Blair is not conservative, but instead a populist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/9526a670-04dc-11dc-80ed-000b5df10621.html &quot;Why Blair was no conservative&quot;], ''Financial Times'', 18 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[Clause IV]] of the Labour Party's constitution defines the party as &quot;Democratic Socialist&quot;.

Critics and admirers tend to agree that Blair's electoral success was based on his ability to occupy the centre ground and appeal to voters across the political spectrum, to the extent that he has been fundamentally at odds with traditional Labour Party values.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Richards, [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/article2531627.ece &quot;Blair the politician: A conjuror who lost touch with his party&quot;], ''The Belfast Telegraph'', 11 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Some left wing critics have argued that Blair has overseen the final stage of a long term shift of the Labour Party to the right, and that very little now remains of a Labour Left.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Marquesee, [http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/isj91/marqusee.htm &quot;Labour's long march to the right&quot;], ''International Socialism'', Issue 91, Summer 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charlie Kimber, [http://web.archive.org/web/20060321091802/http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/article.php?article_id=5147 &quot;Can the left reclaim the Labour Party?&quot;], ''Socialist Worker'', 2 August 2002&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that Blair's long term dominance of the centre has forced his Conservative opponents to shift a long distance to the left, in order to challenge his [[hegemony]] there.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Rice-Oxley, [http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0511/p01s03-woeu.html &quot;Tony Blair's decade of peace and war&quot;], ''The Christian Science Monitor'', 11 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Cowell, [http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/10/01/news/brits.php &quot;Tory leader urges British opposition to stake out 'center ground'&quot;], ''International Herald Tribune'', 1 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Blair has raised taxes (but did not increase income tax for high-earners{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}); introduced a minimum wage and some new employment rights (while keeping Margaret Thatcher's anti-trade union legislation{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}); introduced significant constitutional reforms; promoted new rights for gay people in the [[Civil Partnership Act 2004]]; and signed treaties integrating Britain more closely with the EU.

===Environmental record===
Blair has criticised other governments for not doing enough to solve [[Global warming|global climate change]]. In a 1997 visit to the United States, he made a comment on &quot;great industrialised nations&quot; that fail to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Again in 2003, Blair went before the [[United States Congress]] and said that climate change &quot;cannot be ignored&quot;, insisting &quot;we need to go beyond even [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2003/1118energy_sandalow.aspx Tony Blair and Global Warming] Brookings, 18 November 2003.

===Foreign policy===
====Relationship with the United States====
[[Image:Blair Bush Whitehouse (2004-11-12).jpg|thumb|250px|Tony Blair and [[George W. Bush]] shake hands after their press conference in the East Room of the White House on 12 November 2004.]]
Along with enjoying a close relationship with [[Bill Clinton]], Blair formed a strong political alliance with [[George W. Bush]], particularly in the area of foreign policy. At one point, [[Nelson Mandela]] described Blair as &quot;the U.S. foreign minister&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Mandela condemns US stance on Iraq | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2710181.stm |publisher=BBC News  |date=30 January 2003|accessdate =18 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair has also often openly been referred to as &quot;Bush's poodle&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Blair battles &quot;poodle&quot; jibes | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2721513.stm |publisher=BBC News  |date=3 February 2003|accessdate =30 November 2006 | first=Nick | last=Assinder}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kendall Myers]], a senior analyst at the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], reportedly said that he felt &quot;a little ashamed&quot; of Bush's treatment of the Prime Minister and that his attempts to influence US policy were typically ignored: &quot;It was a done deal from the beginning, it was a one-sided relationship that was entered into with open eyes... There was nothing, no payback, no sense of reciprocity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Bush 'routinely ignoring Blair' | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6158435.stm |publisher=BBC News  |date=30 November 2006|accessdate =30 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his part, Bush lauded Blair and the UK. In his post-[[11 September attacks|11 September]] speech, for example, he stated that &quot;America has no truer friend than Great Britain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html |title=Address to a Joint Session of Congress and the American People |author=[[George W.

Once again, we are joined together in a great cause – so honoured the British Prime Minister has crossed an ocean to show his unity of purpose with America. Thank you for coming, friend. (Applause.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alliance between Bush and Blair seriously damaged Blair's standing in the eyes of many British people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foreignaffairs/story/0,,1828225,00.html |title=Stand up to US, voters tell Blair |author=Julian Glover and Ewen MacAskill |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=25 July 2006 |accessdate=22 November 2007 |quote=Britain should take a much more robust and independent approach to the United States, according to a Guardian/ICM poll published today, which finds strong public opposition to Blair's close working relationship with President Bush. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair argued it is in Britain's interest to &quot;protect and strengthen the bond&quot; with the United States regardless of who is in the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.pm.gov.uk/output/Page6526.asp | title = PM's speech on US Elections| accessdate =29 May 2007|date=3 November 2004| publisher=Prime Minister's Office }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a perception of one-sided compromising personal and political closeness led to serious discussion of the term &quot;Poodle-ism&quot; in the UK media, to describe the &quot;[[Special Relationship]]&quot; of the UK government and Prime Minister with the US White House and President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Hugo Young in Washington |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/nov/14/iraq.foreignpolicy |title=Hugo Young: Blair has not been a poodle, but poodleism still beckons |work=The Guardian |date= 14 November 2002|accessdate=20 April 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A revealing conversation between Bush and Blair, with the former addressing the latter as &quot;[[Yo, Blair|Yo [or Yeah], Blair]]&quot; was recorded when they did not know a microphone was live at the G8 conference in Russia in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/5188258.stm |title=Transcript: Bush and Blair's unguarded chat|publisher=BBC News  |date=18 July 2006 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}.

====Middle East policy and links with Israel====
According to comments in the book, ''Blair'', written by [[Anthony Seldon]], Blair had a deep feeling for [[Israel]], born in part from his faith.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Seldon, ''Blair'', (London: Free Press, 2005), p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; Blair has been a long time member of the pro-Israel lobby group [[Labour Friends of Israel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Uni&quot;&gt;Assaf Uni, [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/932399.html Finance scandal has local community worried], [[Haaretz]], 10 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Blair met [[Michael Levy, Baron Levy|Michael Levy, later Lord Levy]], a pop music mogul and fundraiser.&lt;ref name=&quot;bagman&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/funding/story/0,,1734529,00.html?gusrc=rss | title=There was once a jolly bagman | author=Euan Ferguson |work=Guardian |location=UK|date=19 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair and Levy became close friends and tennis partners.

During his first visit to Israel, Blair thought the Israelis bugged him in his car. He also went on to claim that the Israeli prime minister was merely an &quot;armour-plated bullshitter&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/wintour-and-watt/2011/jan/20/alastaircampbell-binyamin-netanyahu | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Nicholas | last=Watt | title=Britain believes Israeli PM Netanyahu is an 'armour-plated bullshitter' – Alastair Campbell | date=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levy ran the Labour Leader's Office Fund to finance Blair's campaign before the 1997 General Election and raised £12m towards Labour’s landslide victory, Levy was rewarded with a [[life peer|peerage]], and in 2002, Blair appointed Levy as his personal envoy to the Middle East. Levy praised Blair for his 'solid and committed support of the State of Israel'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishcare.org/events/ Jewish Care], Fundraising Dinner 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2092803,00.html |title=Lord Cashpoint's touch of money magic |date=19 March 2006 |last=Wavell |first=Stuart |work=The Sunday Times |location=UK |accessdate =21 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tam Dalyell, while [[Father of the House]] of Commons, suggested in 2003 that Blair's foreign policy decisions were unduly influenced by a cabal of Jewish advisers, including Levy and [[Peter Mandelson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/dalyell-attacks-jewish-cabal-538006.html |title=Dalyell attacks 'Jewish cabal'|work=The Independent |date=4 May 2003 |accessdate=20 April 2010 | location=London | first1=Jo | last1=Dillon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blair, on coming to office, had been 'cool towards the right-wing [[Benjamin Netanyahu|Netanyahu]] government'.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Seldon, ''Blair'', p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; After the election in 1999 of [[Ehud Barak]], with whom Blair forged a close relationship, he became much more sympathetic to Israel.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; From 2001 Blair also built up a relationship with Barak's successor, [[Ariel Sharon]], and responded positively to [[Yasser Arafat|Arafat]], whom he had met thirteen times since becoming prime minister and regarded as essential to future negotiations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; In 2004, 50 former diplomats, including ambassadors to [[Baghdad]] and [[Tel Aviv]], stated they had 'watched with deepening concern' at Britain following the US into war in Iraq in 2003. They criticised Blair's support for the [[Road map for peace]] which included the retaining of [[Israeli settlement]]s on the [[West Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foreignaffairs/story/0,11538,1203898,00.html Diplomats attack Blair's Israel policy], Guardian Unlimited, [[Matthew Tempest]], 26 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Blair was criticised for his failure to immediately call for a ceasefire in the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]].  ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper claimed that at a cabinet meeting before Blair left for a summit with Bush on 28 July 2006, a significant number of ministers pressured Blair to publicly criticise Israel over the scale of deaths and destruction in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1833538,00.html Cabinet in open revolt over Blair's Israel policy], ''[[The Observer]]'', 30 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Blair was criticised for his solid stance alongside US President [[George W.

In March 2010 the [[Advisory Committee on Business Appointments]] revealed that 14 months after resigning as Prime Minister, Blair had served as a paid business consultant to an oil firm with interests in [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blair's fight to keep his oil cash secret: Former PM's deals are revealed as his earnings since 2007 reach £20million|author=Jason Groves|work=Daily Mail |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1259030/Tony-Blairs-secret-dealings-South-Korean-oil-firm-UI-Energy-Corp.html |date=19 March 2010 |accessdate=21 March 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news raised concerns that he had profited financially from contacts he made during the Iraq war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2010/03/20/blair-s-secret-pay-deal-with-iraq-oil-firm-115875-22125177/ Daily Mirror &quot;Tony Blair's secret lucrative advisory job with Iraq oil firm&quot; 20 March 2010].

==Relationship with media==
===Rupert Murdoch===
Blair was reported to have been supported by [[Rupert Murdoch]] the founder of the [[News Corporation]] [[media conglomerate|organisation]].&lt;ref&gt;Gaby Hinsliff, [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/politics/story/0,,1827023,00.html &quot;The PM, the mogul and the secret agenda&quot;], ''The Observer'', 23 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, while leader of the Opposition, Blair disclosed in the Commons register of interests that he was a guest of Murdoch when he flew to meet him in [[Hayman Island]].&lt;ref name='R000977'&gt;{{cite news | first= Andrew| last= Grice| title=Cameron, Murdoch and a Greek island freebie | date=24 October 2008 | url =http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cameron-murdoch-and-a-greek-island-freebie-971470.html |work=The Independent |location=UK | accessdate =25 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contacts with UK media proprietors===
A [[Cabinet Office]] [[freedom of information]] response, released the day after Blair handed over power to [[Gordon Brown]], documents Blair having various official phone calls and meetings with [[Rupert Murdoch]] of [[News Corporation]] and [[Richard Desmond]] of ''Northern and Shell Media''.&lt;ref name='spoke'&gt;{{cite news | title=Blair and Murdoch spoke days before Iraq war | date= 19 July 2007| url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/jul/19/freedomofinformation.iraq |work=The Guardian |location=UK | accessdate =26 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period between September 2002 and April 2005, Blair and Murdoch are documented speaking 6 times; three times in the 9 days before the [[Iraq war]], including the eve of the 20 March US and UK invasion, and on 29 January, 25 April and 3 October 2004. Between January 2003 and February 2004, Blair had three meetings with Richard Desmond; on 29 January and 3 September 2003 and 23 February 2004.&lt;ref name='foi'&gt;{{cite news | title=When Murdoch met Blair – information released | url =http://www.bindmans.com/index.php?id=289 | work=Bindmans | accessdate =26 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='vs'&gt;{{cite news | title=Blair &amp; Murdoch – FOI v Campbell | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/cgi-perl/mt/mt-comments.cgi |work=BBC  | accessdate =26 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The information was disclosed after a three and a half year battle by the [[Liberal Democrats]]' [[Lord Avebury]].&lt;ref name='spoke'/&gt; Lord Avebury's initial October 2003 information request was dismissed by then leader of the Lords, [[Baroness Amos]].&lt;ref name='spoke'/&gt; A following complaint was rejected, with [[Downing Street]] claiming the information compromised free and frank discussions, while [[Cabinet Office]] claimed releasing the timing of the PM's contacts with individuals is undesirable, as it might lead to the content of the discussions being disclosed.&lt;ref name='spoke'/&gt; While awaiting a following appeal from Lord Avebury, the cabinet office announced that it would release the information.
Lord Avebury said: &quot;The public can now scrutinise the timing of his (Murdoch's) contacts with the former Prime Minister, to see whether they can be linked to events in the outside world.&quot;&lt;ref name='spoke'/&gt;

===Media portrayal===
Blair is acknowledged by most{{Who|date=July 2010}} to be a highly skilful media performer who comes over as charismatic, informal, and articulate.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} A few months after becoming Prime Minister he gave a tribute to [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] on the morning of her death in August 1997, in which he famously described her as &quot;the People's Princess&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buerkle |first=Tom |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/01/news/01iht-london.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Charles Takes Diana's Body Home From Paris – World Mourns the 'People's Princess' |work=The New York Times  |date=1 September 1997 |accessdate=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1556863/Tony-coined-the-peoples-princess.html |title=Tony coined the 'people's princess' |publisher=Telegraph |date=9 July 2007 |accessdate=20 July 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After taking office in 1997, Blair gave particular prominence to his press secretary, who became known as the [[Prime Minister's Official Spokesman]] (the two roles have since been separated). Blair's first PMOS was [[Alastair Campbell]], who served in that role from May 1997 to 8 June 2001, after which he served as the Prime Minister's Director of Communications and Strategy until his resignation on 29 August 2003 in the aftermath of the [[Hutton Inquiry]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

==Relationship with Labour Party==
Blair's apparent refusal to set a date for his departure was criticised by the British press and Members of Parliament. It has been reported that a number of cabinet ministers believed that Blair's timely departure from office would be required to be able to win a fourth election.&lt;ref name=independent-09-04-06/&gt; Some ministers viewed Blair's announcement of policy initiatives in September 2006 as an attempt to draw attention away from these issues.&lt;ref name=independent-09-04-06&gt;{{cite news|title='Deluded': Extraordinary attack on Blair by Cabinet |date=4 September 2006 |work=The Independent |location=UK |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article1325433.ece  | first=Francis | last=Elliott | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gordon Brown===
{{See also|Blair–Brown deal}}
After the death of [[John Smith (UK politician)|John Smith]] in 1994, Blair and his close colleague [[Gordon Brown]] (they shared an office at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]) were both seen as possible candidates for the party leadership. They agreed not to stand against each other, it is said, as part of a supposed Blair-Brown pact. Brown, who considered himself the senior of the two, understood that Blair would give way to him: opinion polls soon indicated, however, that Blair appeared to enjoy greater support among voters.&lt;ref&gt;A MORI opinion poll published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' on 15 May found that, among the general public, Blair had the support of 32%, John Prescott 19%, Margaret Beckett 14%, Gordon Brown 9% and [[Robin Cook]] 5%.&lt;/ref&gt; Their relationship in power became so turbulent that (it was reported) the [[Deputy Prime Minister|deputy prime minister]], [[John Prescott]], often had to act as &quot;marriage guidance counsellor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labour2003/comment/0,,1056215,00.html | title = A marriage on the rocks | author=[[Andrew Rawnsley]] |work=The Observer |location=UK | publisher=Guardian Newspapers Ltd. | date = 5 October 2003 | accessdate =5 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 June 2007, Blair officially resigned as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] after ten years in office, and he was officially confirmed as Middle East [[Diplomacy|envoy]] for the United Nations, European Union, United States, and Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;envoy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Blair becomes Middle East envoy |work=BBC News  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6244358.stm |date=27 June 2007 |accessdate=27 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair originally indicated that he would retain his parliamentary seat after his resignation as Prime Minister came into effect; however, on being confirmed for the Middle East role he resigned from the Commons by taking up an [[List of Stewards of the Chiltern Hundreds|office of profit]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent27June2007&quot; /&gt; President George W.

During the first nine days of the [[2008–2009 Israel-Gaza conflict]], Blair was allegedly spotted at the opening of the [[Armani]] store at [[Knightsbridge]]. Aides said he had been in phone contact with other world leaders since the fighting began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Matthew Kalman |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1105250/As-Gaza-torn-apart-war-Middle-East-peace-envoy-Tony-Blair-Hes-HOLIDAY.html |title=As Gaza is torn apart by war, where is Middle East peace envoy Tony Blair?

===Private sector===
In January 2008, it was confirmed that Blair would be joining investment bank [[JPMorgan Chase]] in a &quot;senior advisory capacity&quot;&lt;ref name=JPMC&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7180306.stm|title=Tony Blair joins investment bank|publisher=BBC News |date=10 January 2008|accessdate=10 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he would advise [[Zurich Financial Services]] on [[climate change]]. Some sources have claimed that his role at JP Morgan will pay more than $1m a year.&lt;ref name=JPMC/&gt; This additional salary will contribute to annual earnings of over £7m.&lt;ref&gt;Hencke, David [http://politics.guardian.co.uk/tonyblair/story/0,,2248529,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront Insurance job takes Blair's earnings above £7m], [[The Guardian]], 29 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Blair also gives lectures and earns up to US$250,000 for a 90-minute speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5034235.ece Lectures see Tony Blair earnings jump over £12m] Times Online, 29 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/people,1565,blairs-earnings-are-12m-a-year,52596 |title=People: Tony Blair’s earnings are £12m a year |publisher=The First Post |date=29 October 2008 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yale University announced on 7 March 2008 that Blair will teach a course on issues of faith and globalisation at the Yale Schools of [[Yale School of Management|Management]] and [[Yale Divinity School|Divinity]] as a [[Howland Memorial Prize|Howland distinguished fellow]] during the 2008–09 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kim |last=Martineau |title=Blair To Teach At Yale Next Year |url=http://www.courant.com/news/custom/topnews/hcu-tonyblair-0307,0,1787038.story |work=[[The Hartford Courant]] |publisher=[[Tribune Company]] |location=[[Hartford, Connecticut]] |date=7 March 2008 |accessdate=7 March 2008}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tony Blair Associates===

Blair has established ''[[Tony Blair Associates]]''. This firm will &quot;allow him to provide, in partnership with others, strategic advice on a commercial and ''pro bono'' [free] basis, on political and economic trends and governmental reform.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5780937.ece Tony Blair Inc: a nice little earner] The Sunday Times, 22 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, Blair has been the subject of criticism for apparent conflicts of interest that allow the former prime minister, now a Middle East peace envoy, to earn large sums of money, both directly and through Tony Blair Associates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/tony-blair/8787053/Tony-Blairs-Byzantine-world-of-advisers-and-lucrative-deals.html Tony Blair's Byzantine world of advisers and lucrative deals] The Daily Telegraph, 24 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/tony-blair/8784596/On-the-desert-trail-of-Tony-Blairs-millions.html On the desert trail of Tony Blair's millions] The Daily Telegraph, 24 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Quartet===
[[Nabil Shaath]], a senior Abbas associate, said that Blair was acting as Israel's &quot;defence attorney&quot; in face of Abbas' application for a [[International recognition of the State of Palestine|Palestinian state]] to be admitted as a full member of the United Nations. According to a recent episode of the investigative documentary series [[Dispatches (TV series)|''Dispatches,'']] on the UK's [[Channel 4]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/episode-guide/series-102/episode-1 The Wonderful World of Tony Blair]&lt;/ref&gt; Blair has used his [[Quartet on the Middle East|Quartet]] role to gain introductions and proximity to Arab leaders, with whom he then signed private consulting contracts  for Tony Blair Associates. He obtained one such contract, worth $40m from the [[Emir of Kuwait]], to advise on reforms, and another from the rulers of the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Blair was instrumental in lobbying Israel to release frequencies in November 2009 for mobile phone company [[Wataniya]] to operate in the [[occupied West Bank]]. Wataniya is owned by the Qatari telecoms giant [[Q-Tel]] which bought Wataniya in 2007 with a $2 billions, loan arranged by the bank [[JP Morgan]], according to ''Dispatches''. Blair also works for JP Morgan, which pays him over $2m a year for providing &quot;strategic&quot; advice. JP Morgan stood to make &quot;substantial profits&quot; if the deal went through, the British documentary said. Israel had tied approval of Wataniya's frequencies to the [[Palestinian National Authority|PA]] dropping efforts to pursue the [[Goldstone report]] on Israeli [[United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict|war crimes in Gaza]], through the UN. Blair also brokered another major deal with Israel for [[British Gas plc|British Gas]] to secure contracts to exploit natural gas fields worth up to $6 billions, in the [[territorial waters]] of the Gaza Strip. Blair negotiated the deal directly with Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]. In 2007, the United Nations Programme of Assistance to the Palestinian People spent over $400,000 on three [[Armored car (VIP)|armoured cars]] for Blair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/10/201110375817236134.html Why the UN must abolish the 'Quartet'.] By [[Ali Abunimah]]. ''[[Al Jazeera]]'', 5 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Council president speculation===
In 2009, there  was speculation in the media that Blair was open to the idea of becoming the first President of the [[European Council]], a post created in the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] that would come into force in 2009, if successfully ratified. [[Gordon Brown]] added his support, but noted that it was premature to discuss candidates before the treaty was approved. A spokesman for Blair did not rule out him accepting the post, but said that he was concentrating on his current role in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grice|first=Andrew|title=Blair emerges as candidate for 'President of Europe'|work=The Independent |location=UK |date=20 October 2007|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article3078889.ece|accessdate=21 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair was later invited to speak on European issues at a rally of [[President Sarkozy]]'s party, the [[Union for a Popular Movement]], on 12 January 2008, which fuelled speculation further.&lt;ref&gt;AFP (2007).

There was opposition to Blair's candidacy for the job. In the UK, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and the [[Liberal Democrats]] both said they would oppose Blair. In Germany, the leader of the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democrats]], [[Guido Westerwelle]], said that he preferred a candidate from a smaller European country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Blair | first=Tony | title=German party cool on Blair for EU | date=28 October 2009 | publisher=BBC World Service News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8329554.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Minister of Luxembourg, [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] emerged as a rival to Blair's candidacy and had the backing for many of the smaller European member states. In November 2009, the Belgian PM [[Herman Van Rompuy]] was named [[President of the European Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8369730.stm|title=EU foreign head dismisses critics|publisher=The BBC|date=20 November 2009|accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Blair | first=Tony | title=Downing Street is less optimistic about Blair campaign to become EU President | date=29 October 2009 | publisher=BBC World Service News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8333192.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charity===
On 14 November 2007, Blair launched the Tony Blair Sports Foundation, which aims to &quot;increase childhood participation in sports activities, especially in the North East of England, where a larger proportion of children are socially excluded, and to promote overall health and prevent childhood obesity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tonyblairsportsfoundation.org/ |title=Tony Blair Sports Foundation |publisher=Tony Blair Sports Foundation |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 May 2008, Blair launched the [[Tony Blair Faith Foundation]] as a vehicle for encouraging different faiths to join together in promoting respect and understanding, as well as working to tackle poverty. Reflecting Blair's own faith but not dedicated to any particular religion, the Foundation aims to &quot;show how faith is a powerful force for good in the modern world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/about-us/mission-statement.html &quot;Mission statement&quot;]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}, Tony Blair Faith Foundation, 30 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Foundation will use its profile and resources to encourage people of faith to work together more closely to tackle global poverty and conflict,&quot; says its mission statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-god-blog/2009/09/faith-foundation-blair-speech|title=Tony Blair’s Faith Foundation speech|work=The New Statesman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===War crimes finding===
On 22 November 2011, a mock war-crimes tribunal put together by the [[Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission]] reached a unanimous verdict that Tony Blair and George W. Bush are guilty of crimes against peace, crimes against humanity, and genocide as a result of their roles in the 2003 Iraq War. The trial, which lasted 4 days, consisting of 5 judges of judicial and academic backgrounds, a court-appointed defence team in lieu of the defendants or representatives, and a prosecution team including international law professor [[Francis Boyle]], does not have powers to apprehend the pair, but issued an order for the findings to be reported to the [[International Criminal Court]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/11/20111128105712109215.html Kuala Lumpur tribunal: Bush and Blair guilty] - Richard Falk, ''Al Jazeera''&lt;/ref&gt; The court's finding received mixed responses, being labelled a &quot;circus&quot; by former UN Special Rapporteur [[Param Cumaraswamy]], and supported as &quot;necessary work&quot; by former US Congresswoman [[Cynthia McKinney]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=36581 Mahathir's War Crimes Court to Name and Shame] ''IPS News''&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, before his resignation, it was reported that Blair would be offered a knighthood in the [[Order of the Thistle]], owing to his Scottish connections (rather than the [[Order of the Garter]], which is usually offered to former Prime Ministers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2007/05/13/dp1301.xml#head1 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080121050131/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2007/05/13/dp1301.xml#head1 |archivedate=21 January 2008 |title=Queen makes Blair an offer that he can refuse  |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=13 May 2007 |accessdate=22 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No such move has been made since, and Blair has reportedly indicated that he does not want the traditional knighthood or peerage bestowed on former prime ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/1574027/Tony-Blair-spurns-honour-system.html |title=Tony Blair spurns honour system |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=30 December 2007 |accessdate=1 September 2010  | first=Melissa | last=Kite}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 February 2009, Blair was awarded the [[Dan David Prize]] by Tel Aviv University for &quot;exceptional leadership and steadfast determination in helping to engineer agreements and forge lasting solutions to areas in conflict&quot;. He was awarded the prize in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=17 February 2009 |url=http://jta.org/news/article/2009/02/17/1003041/blair-is-dan-david-prize-winner |title=Blair wins Dan David Prize| publisher=JTA – Jewish &amp; Israel News |date=17 February 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfi.fr/actuen/articles/110/article_2916.asp |title=Blair's peace-broker prize surreal, say anti-war campaigners |publisher=Radio France Internationale|accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 September 2010, Blair was awarded the [[Liberty Medal]] at the [[National Constitution Center]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. It was presented by former President [[Bill Clinton]], and is awarded annually to men and women of courage and conviction who strive to secure the blessings of liberty to people around the globe.

Because Blair is credited as being instrumental in ending the conflict in [[Kosovo]], boys born in that country following the war have been given the name Toni or [[Tonibler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10576544 |title=Namesakes welcome Tony Blair during Kosovo visit |publisher=BBC |work=BBC News |date=9 July 2010 |accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Economic Forum''' ('''WEF''') is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[non-profit]] [[foundation (non-profit)|foundation]], based in [[Cologny]], [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]]. It describes itself as an independent international organization committed to improving the state of the world by engaging business, political, academic and other leaders of society to shape global, regional and industry agendas.

The Forum is best known for its annual meeting in [[Davos]], a mountain resort in [[Graubünden]], in the eastern [[Alps]] region of Switzerland. The meeting brings together some 2,500 top business leaders, international political leaders, selected intellectuals and journalists to discuss the most pressing issues facing the world, including health and the environment.  

The organisation also convenes some six to eight regional meetings each year in locations such as Latin America and East Asia, as well as undertaking two further annual meetings in China and the United Arab Emirates.

Beside meetings, the foundation produces a series of research reports and engages its members in sector specific initiatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pigman p41-42&quot;&gt;Pigman. pp. 41&amp;ndash;42.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The 2011 annual meeting in Davos was held from 26 January to 30 January. The 2012 meeting was held on 25-29 January 2012, with the theme &quot;The Great Transformation: Shaping New Models&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/AM12/WEF_AM12_ExecutiveSummary.pdf |title=World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2012 Executive Summary document |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Forum was founded in 1971 by [[Klaus Schwab]], a [[Germany|German-born]] business professor at the [[University of Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;Pigman. pp. 6&amp;ndash;22.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally named the &quot;European Management Forum&quot;, it changed its name to the World Economic Forum in 1987 and sought to broaden its vision further to include providing a platform for resolving international conflicts.

In the summer of 1971, Schwab invited 444 executives from [[Western European]] firms to the first European Management Symposium held in the [[Davos Congress Centre]] under the patronage of the [[European Commission]] and European industrial associations, where Schwab sought to introduce European firms to [[United States|American]] management practices. He then founded the WEF as a non-profit organization based in Geneva and drew European business leaders to Davos for the annual meetings each January.&lt;ref&gt;Kellerman. p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1971 Opening.jpg|thumb|Professor Klaus Schwab opens the inaugural European Management Forum in Davos in 1971]]

Schwab developed the [[stakeholder theory|&quot;stakeholder&quot; management approach]] which attributed corporate success on managers taking account of all interests: not merely [[shareholders]], clients and [[customers]], but also [[employees]] and the communities within which the firm is situated, including governments.&lt;ref&gt;Schwab and Kroos.&lt;/ref&gt; Events in 1973, including the collapse of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] fixed-exchange rate mechanism and the [[Arab-Israeli War]], saw the annual meeting expand its focus from management to economic and social issues, and political leaders were invited for the first time to the annual meeting in January 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Registration required|date=January 2011}} [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0304411c-c5e8-11dc-8378-0000779fd2ac,dwp_uuid=01b19234-b4b2-11dc-990a-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1 &quot;Interview: Klaus Schwab&quot;].''[[Financial Times]]''. 22 January 2008.

As the years went by, political leaders began to use the annual meeting as a neutral platform to resolve their differences. The Davos Declaration was signed in 1988 by [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]], helping them turn back from the brink of war. In 1992, [[President of South Africa|South African President]] [[F. W. de Klerk]] met with [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi|Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi]] at the annual meeting, their first joint appearance outside South Africa.

===Research reports===
The foundation also serves as a [[think tank]], and publishes a wide range of reports focusing on issues of concern and importance to Forum communities. In particular, Strategic Insight Teams focus on producing reports of relevance in the fields of competitiveness, global risks and [[scenario planning|scenario thinking]].

The Competitiveness Team&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weforum.org/en/initiatives/gcp/index.htm |title=Issues &amp;#124; World Economic Forum-Issues |work=Weforum.org |publisher=World Economic Forum |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; produces a range of annual economic reports (first published in brackets): the [[Global Competitiveness Report]] (1979) measures competitiveness of countries and economies; The [[Global Information Technology Report]] (2001) assesses their competitiveness based on their IT readiness; the [[Global Gender Gap Report]] examines critical areas of inequality between men and women; the [[Global Risks Report]] (2006) assesses key global risks; the [[Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report|Global Travel and Tourism Report]] (2007) measures travel and tourism competitiveness and the [[Global Enabling Trade Report]] (2008) presents a cross-country analysis of the large number of measures facilitating trade between nations.&lt;ref&gt;Pigman. pp. 43, 92&amp;ndash;112.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initiatives===
The Global Health Initiative was launched by [[Kofi Annan]] at the Annual Meeting in 2002. The GHI's mission was to engage businesses in public-private partnerships to tackle [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]], [[malaria]] and health systems.

The Global Education Initiative (GEI), launched during the Annual Meeting in 2003, brought together international IT companies and governments in Jordan, [[Egypt]] and India which has resulted in new [[personal computer]] hardware in the classrooms and more local teachers trained in [[e-learning]]. This is having a real impact on the lives of children. The GEI model which is scalable and sustainable is now being used as an educational blueprint in other countries including [[Rwanda]].

The Environmental Initiative covers Climate Change and Water. Under the [[2005 G8 Summit|Gleneagles Dialogue on Climate Change]], the [[government of the United Kingdom|U.K. government]] asked the World Economic Forum at the [[31st G8 summit|G8 Summit in Gleneagles in 2005]] to facilitate a dialogue with the business community to develop recommendations for reducing [[greenhouse gas emissions]]. This set of recommendations, endorsed by a global group of CEOs, was presented to leaders ahead of the G8 Summit in [[Toyako]]/[[Hokkaido]] held in July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Richard (20 June 2008).

In an effort to combat corruption, the [[Partnering Against Corruption Initiative]] (PACI) was launched by CEOs from the [[Engineering]] and [[Construction]], [[Energy]] and [[Metals]] and [[Mining]] industries at the Annual Meeting in Davos in January 2004. PACI is a platform for peer exchange on practical experience and dilemma situations. Some 140 companies have signed.&lt;ref&gt;Pigman. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
====Technology Pioneers Programme====
The Technology Pioneers Programme recognizes companies all over the world designing and developing new technologies. The award is given to 30&amp;ndash;50 companies each year. Since 2000, more than 400 companies from 5 continents have been given the award. 

In line with the foundation's commitment to improving the state of the world, the Tech Pioneers are integrated into its activities with the objective to identify and address future-oriented issues on the global agenda, in proactive, innovative and entrepreneurial ways. By bringing these executives together with scientists, academics, NGOs, and foundation members and partners, the foundation's goal is to shed new light on how technologies can be used to, for example, find new vaccines, create economic growth and enhance global communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weforum.org/en/Communities/Technology%20Pioneers/ |title=World Economic Forum — Technology Pioneers |work=Weforum.org |publisher=World Economic Forum |accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In the late 1990s the foundation, along with the [[G7]], [[World Bank]], [[World Trade Organization]] and [[International Monetary Fund]], came under heavy criticism by [[anti-globalisation]] activists who claimed that capitalism and globalization were increasing poverty and destroying the environment. 10,000 demonstrators disrupted the World Economic Forum in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], obstructing the passage of 200 delegates to the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Barret, Bernard (15 November 2000).

American linguist and public intellectual [[Noam Chomsky]] thinks that globalization in the sense of investors and privileged elites or some participants of the World Economic Forum is a propaganda term.

Chomsky said in an interview,{{quote|&quot;The dominant propaganda systems have appropriated the term 'globalization' to refer to the specific version of international economic integration that they favor, which privileges the rights of investors and lenders, those of people being incidental. In accord with this usage, those who favor a different form of international integration, which privileges the rights of human beings, become 'anti-globalist.' This is simply vulgar propaganda, like the term 'anti-Soviet' used by the most disgusting commissars to refer to dissidents. It is not only vulgar, but idiotic. Take the [[World Social Forum]], called 'anti-globalization' in the propaganda system—which happens to include the media, the educated classes, etc., with rare exceptions. The WSF is a paradigm example of globalization. It is a gathering of huge numbers of people from all over the world, from just about every corner of life one can think of, apart from the extremely narrow highly privileged elites who meet at the competing World Economic Forum, and are called 'pro-globalization' by the propaganda system. An observer watching this farce from Mars would collapse in hysterical laughter at the antics of the educated classes.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}}}

The annual meeting has also been decried as a &quot;mix of pomp and platitude&quot;, and criticized for moving away from serious economics and accomplishing little of substance, particularly with the increasing involvement of NGOs that have little or no expertise in economics. Instead of a discussion on the world economy with knowledgeable experts alongside key business and political players, the annual meeting now features the top media political causes of the day, such as global climate change and AIDS in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |author=Gowers, Andrew|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/article716954.ece?token=null&amp;offset=0&amp;page=1|title=Davos: Beanfeast of Pomp and Platitude |newspaper= [[The Sunday Times]]|date= 22 January 2006 |accessdate=25 January 2011|authorlink= Andrew Gowers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public Eye Awards ===

The [[Public Eye Awards]] have been held every year since 2000. It is a counter-event to the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. Public Eye Awards is public competition of the world's worst corporation. In 2011 more than 50,000 voted for companies acted irresponsibly. At a ceremony at a Davos hotel  the &quot;winners&quot; in 2011 were named as [[Indonesia]]n [[palm oil]] diesel maker [[Neste Oil]] in Finland and mining company [[AngloGold Ashanti]] in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lang |first=Olivia |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/davos/9379067.stm |title=BBC Davos Day three |publisher=BBC News |date=28 January 2011 |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Davos Man==

Davos Man is a [[neologism]] which refers to the global [[elite]] of [[wealthy]] men whose members view themselves as completely international.  [[Davos]] is an Alpine city in eastern [[Switzerland]] which became famous in the 1990s for hosting the World Economic Forum, an annual gathering of international politicians and financiers who represented a transnational elite. It is similar to the term ''Masters of the Universe'' attributed to influential financiers on Wall St.

Davos Men supposedly see their identity as a matter of personal choice, not an accident of birth. According to political scientist [[Samuel P. Huntington]], who is credited with inventing the phrase &quot;Davos Man&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Garton Ash. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1404411,00.html Davos man's death wish], ''The Guardian'', 3 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; they are people who &quot;have little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the élite's global operations&quot;. In his 2004 article &quot;Dead Souls: The Denationalization of the American Elite,&quot; he argues that this international perspective is a minority elitist position not shared by the nationalist majority of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Huntington. Dead Souls: The Denationalization of the American Elite], ''[[The National Interest]]'', Spring 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

John Fonte of the [[Hudson Institute]] has suggested that the transnational ideology of ''Davos Man'' represents a major challenge to [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s assertion that [[liberal democracy]] represents the fulfillment of [[The End of History and the Last Man]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/transnational_progressivism.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hernando de Soto Polar]] of the [[Institute for Liberty and Democracy]] attributes a similar concept to Henri Braudel, referring to it as the &quot;bell jar&quot;. Although internationally connected, each country's elite lives in a bell jar in the sense of being out of touch with its own populace. Their isolation fosters a tendency to be oblivious to the fate of their fellow citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Hernando de Soto. The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else. Basic Books. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Physical chemistry|physical chemist]] by professional background, Merkel entered politics in the wake of the [[Revolutions of 1989]] and briefly served as the deputy spokesperson for [[Lothar de Maizière]]'s democratically elected [[East Germany|East German]] government prior to the [[Reunification of Germany]]. Following reunification in 1990, she was elected to the [[Bundestag]], where she has represented the state of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] since. She served as [[Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth|Federal Minister for Women and Youth]] 1991–1994 and as [[Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety|Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety]] 1994–1998 in [[Helmut Kohl]]'s [[Cabinet Kohl IV|fourth]] and [[Cabinet Kohl V|fifth cabinet]]s. She was Secretary General of the CDU 1998–2000, and was elected chairperson in 2000. From 2002 to 2005, she was also chair of the [[CDU/CSU]] parliamentary coalition.

After her election as Chancellor following the [[German federal election, 2005|2005 federal election]], she led a [[Grand coalition (Germany)|grand coalition]] consisting of her own CDU party, its Bavarian sister party, the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] (CSU), and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), until 2009. In the [[German federal election, 2009|2009 federal election]], the CDU obtained the largest share of the votes, and formed a coalition government with the CSU and the liberal [[Freie Demokratische Partei|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP).&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCnewterm2&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8329490.stm  | title = Germany's Merkel begins new term | accessdate = 2009-11-01 | date = 2009-10-28 | publisher = BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Merkel was [[President of the European Council]] and chaired the [[G8]], the second woman (after [[Margaret Thatcher]]) to do so. She played a central role in the negotiation of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] and the [[Berlin Declaration (2007)|Berlin Declaration]]. Merkel is seen as playing a crucial role in managing the [[Late-2000s financial crisis|financial crisis]] at the European and international level, and has been referred to as &quot;the decider.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.npr.org/2011/12/08/143292255/can-angela-merkel-save-europe&lt;/ref&gt; In domestic policy, [[health care reform]] and problems concerning future [[energy development]] have been major issues of her tenure.

Angela Merkel has for several years been described as the world’s most powerful woman and as &quot;the ''de facto'' leader of the [[EU]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/8720698/Angela-Merkel-worlds-most-powerful-woman.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forbes.com/profile/angela-merkel/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Merkel was born Angela Dorothea Kasner in [[Hamburg]], [[West Germany]], the daughter of [[Horst Kasner]] (1926–2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsecho.de/news/ticker/Sa6pk0PGTGs/merkels_vater_gestorben_termine_abgesagt|title=Merkels Vater gestorben - Termine abgesagt|language=German|publisher=newsecho.de|date=2011-09-03|accessdate=2011-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[pastor]] and a native of Berlin, and his wife, Herlind (born 1928 in [[Free City of Danzig|Danzig]], as Herlind Jentzsch), a teacher of [[English language|English]] and [[Latin]]. Her mother was once a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Was an Angela Merkels Mutter vorbildlich ist| language = German | trans_title = | url = http://www.welt.de/politik/article2496274/Was-an-Angela-Merkels-Mutter-vorbildlich-ist.html| work = Welt Online| date = 26 September 2008 | accessdate = 31 July 2010 | quote = 'Nein, in der SPD bin ich nicht mehr.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In an interview with ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' in 2000, Merkel stated that she was one quarter [[Poles|Polish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-18124491.html |title=Mut zu Zwischentönen| language=German |publisher=Spiegel.de |date=2000-12-25 |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Preußische Allgemeine Zeitung]], attempting to establish if this referred to her grandparents on her mother's side, Willi Jentzsch and Gertrud Drange, reported that, according to their researches, they were both of German descent and lived in Danzig where Willi Jentzsch was a [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] teacher.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webarchiv-server.de/pin/archiv11/0320110122paz06.htm &lt;/ref&gt; She has a brother, Marcus (born 7 July 1957), and a sister, Irene (born 19 August 1964).

Merkel's father studied [[theology]] in [[Heidelberg]] and, afterwards, in Hamburg. In 1954 her father received a pastorate at the church in [[Quitzow]] (near [[Perleberg]] in [[Brandenburg]]), which then was in [[East Germany]], and the family moved to [[Templin]]. Thus Merkel grew up in the countryside {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Berlin]]. [[Gerd Langguth]], a former senior member of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, states in his book&lt;ref name=&quot;Langguth&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last = Langguth  | first = Gerd  | title = Angela Merkel  | origyear = 2005 | publisher = dtv | location = Munich | language = German| isbn =3-423-24485-2  | year = 2005| month = August}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the family's ability to travel freely from East to West Germany during the following years, as well as their possession of two automobiles, leads to the conclusion that Merkel's father had a &quot;sympathetic&quot; relationship with the communist regime, since such freedom and perquisites for a Christian pastor and his family would have been otherwise impossible in East Germany.

Like most pupils, Merkel was a member of the official, [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist]]-led youth movement [[Free German Youth|Free German Youth (FDJ)]]. However, she did not take part in the [[secular]] [[coming of age]] ceremony [[Jugendweihe]], which was common in East Germany, and was [[Confirmation (sacrament)#Lutheran view|confirmed]] instead.  Later, at the Academy of Sciences, she became a member of the FDJ district board and secretary for &quot;[[Agitprop]]&quot; (Agitation and Propaganda).  Merkel herself claimed that she was secretary for culture. When Merkel's onetime FDJ district chairman contradicted her, she insisted that: &quot;According to my memory, I was secretary for culture. But what do I know? I believe I won't know anything when I'm 80.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-67682698.html |title=Die Schläferin |language=[[German language|German]] |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=2009-11-09 |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Merkel's progress in the compulsory Marxism-Leninism course was graded only ''genügend'' (sufficient, passing grade) in 1983 and 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,675061,00.html |title=Glänzend in Physik, mäßig in der Ideologie |language=[[German language|German]] |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=2010-01-31 |quote=&quot;Nach meiner Erinnerung war ich Kultursekretärin. Aber was weiß ich denn? Ich glaube, wenn ich 80 bin, weiß ich gar nichts mehr&quot;, sagt sie.  |accessdate=2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At school, she learned to speak [[Russian language|Russian]] fluently, and was awarded prizes for her proficiency in Russian and Mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Langguth | first = Gerd | authorlink = Gerd Langguth | title = Angela Merkel | year = 2005 | month = August | publisher = DTV | language = German | isbn = 3423244852 | page = 50 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Merkel was educated in Templin and at the [[University of Leipzig]], where she studied [[physics]] from 1973 to 1978. While a student, she participated in the reconstruction of the ruin of the [[Moritzbastei]], a project students initiated to create their own club and recreation facility on campus. Such an initiative was unprecedented in the [[East Germany|GDR]] of that period, and initially resisted by the [[University of Leipzig]]. However, with backing of the local leadership of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] party, the project was allowed to proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/authoralbumbackground/3852/drogenwahn_auf_der_baustelle.html |title=Drogenwahn auf der Dauerbaustelle|language=German|publisher=Spiegel Online |date=2009-03-27 |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merkel worked and studied at the Central Institute for [[Physical chemistry|Physical Chemistry]] of the [[German Academy of Sciences Berlin|Academy of Sciences]] in [[Adlershof|Berlin-Adlershof]] from 1978 to 1990.  After being awarded a [[doctorate]] (''[[Dr. rer. nat.]]'') for her thesis on [[quantum chemistry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Merkel | first = Angela

In 1989, Merkel got involved in the growing [[democracy]] movement after the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]], joining the new party [[Demokratischer Aufbruch|Democratic Awakening]]. Following the [[East German general election, 1990|first (and only) democratic election]] of the East German state, she became the deputy spokesperson of the new pre-[[German reunification|unification]] caretaker government under [[Lothar de Maizière]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Langguth112&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last = Langguth  | first = Gerd  | title = Angela Merkel  | origyear = 2005 | publisher = dtv | location = Munich | language = German| isbn =3-423-24485-2 | pages = 112–137  | year = 2005| month = August}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Member of Bundestag and cabinet minister==
At the [[German federal election, 1990|first post-reunification general election]] in December 1990, she was elected to the Bundestag from the [[constituency]] [[Stralsund – Nordvorpommern – Rügen (electoral district)|Stralsund – Nordvorpommern – Rügen]], which is coextensive with the [[Districts of Germany|district]] of [[Vorpommern-Rügen]]. This has remained her electoral district until today. Her party merged with the west German CDU&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2010-10/kohl-in-berlin|title=Des Altkanzlers mahnende Worte|language=German|publisher=Zeit Online|date=2010-10-01|accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she became Minister for Women and Youth in [[Helmut Kohl]]'s 3rd cabinet. In 1994, she was made [[Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety|Minister for the Environment and Nuclear Safety]], which gave her greater political visibility and a platform on which to build her political career. As one of Kohl's protégées and his youngest cabinet minister, she was referred to by Kohl as &quot;''mein Mädchen''&quot; (&quot;my girl&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,357997,00.html|title=Kohls unterschätztes Mädchen|language=German|publisher=Spiegel Online|date=2005-05-30|accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leader of the opposition==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-0803-017, Lothar de Maiziere und Angela Merkel.jpg|thumb|Merkel (right) as deputy government spokesperson together with [[Lothar de Maizière]], August 1990]] 
When the Kohl government was [[German federal election, 1998|defeated in the 1998 general election]], Merkel was named Secretary-General of the CDU. In this position, Merkel oversaw a string of Christian Democrat election victories in six out of seven state elections in 1999 alone, breaking the SPD-Green coalition's hold on the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]], the legislative body representing the [[States of Germany|states]]. Following [[1999 CDU contributions scandal|a party financing scandal]], which compromised many leading figures of the CDU (most notably Kohl himself, who refused to reveal the donor of DM 2,000,000 claiming he had given his word of honour and the then party chairman [[Wolfgang Schäuble]], Kohl's hand-picked successor, who wasn't cooperative either), Merkel criticized her former mentor, Kohl, and advocated a fresh start for the party without him. She was elected to replace Schäuble, becoming the first female chair of her party, on 10 April 2000. Her election surprised many observers, as her personality offered a contrast to the party she had been chosen to lead; Merkel is a [[Protestant]], originating from predominantly Protestant northern Germany, while the CDU is a male-dominated, [[social conservative|socially conservative]] party with strongholds in western and southern Germany, and the Bavarian sister party, the CSU, has deep [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] roots.

Following Merkel's election as CDU leader, she enjoyed considerable popularity among the German population and was favoured by many Germans to become [[Gerhard Schröder|Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's]] challenger in the [[German federal election, 2002|2002 election]]. However, she did not receive enough support in her own party and particularly its sister party (the [[Bavaria]]n [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|Christian Social Union]], or CSU), and was subsequently out-manoeuvred politically by CSU leader [[Edmund Stoiber]], to whom she eventually ceded the privilege of challenging Schröder; however, he squandered a large lead in the opinion polls to lose the election by a razor-thin margin. After Stoiber's defeat in 2002, in addition to her role as CDU chairwoman, Merkel became leader of the conservative opposition in the lower house of the German parliament, the [[Bundestag]]. Her rival, [[Friedrich Merz]], who had held the post of parliamentary leader prior to the 2002 election, was eased out to make way for Merkel.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Merkel supported a substantial [[reform movement|reform]] agenda concerning [[Germany]]'s economic and social system and was considered to be more pro-[[market]] than her own party (the CDU); she advocated changes to German labour law, specifically removing barriers to laying off employees and increasing the allowed number of work hours in a week, arguing that existing laws made the country less competitive because companies cannot easily control labour costs at times when business is slow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,249207,00.html |title=Merkel fordert längere Arbeitszeit|language=German|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=2003-05-18|accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merkel argued for Germany's [[nuclear power]] to be phased out less quickly than the Schröder administration had planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP_Merkel_Nuclear_phase_out_is_wrong_1006081.html |title=Merkel: Nuclear phase-out is wrong|publisher=World Nuclear News|date=2008-06-10|accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merkel advocated a strong transatlantic partnership and German-American friendship. In the spring of 2003, defying strong public opposition, Merkel came out in favour of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S. invasion of Iraq]], describing it as &quot;unavoidable&quot; and accusing Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] of [[anti-Americanism]].  She criticised the government's support for the [[accession of Turkey to the European Union]] and favoured a &quot;[[privileged partnership]]&quot; instead. In doing so, she reflected public opinion that grew more hostile toward Turkish membership of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;Marlies Casier and Joost Jongerden, eds. ''Nationalisms and Politics in Turkey'' (2010) p 110&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise to power===
On 30 May 2005, Merkel won the CDU/CSU nomination as challenger to Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] in the [[German federal election, 2005|2005 national elections]]. Her party began the campaign with a 21 point lead over the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] in national [[opinion poll]]s, although her personal popularity lagged behind that of the [[incumbent]]. However, the CDU/CSU campaign suffered{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} when Merkel, having made economic competence central to the CDU's platform, confused [[gross income|gross]] and [[net income]] twice during a televised debate. She regained some momentum after she announced that she would appoint [[Paul Kirchhof]], a former judge at the German Constitutional Court and leading fiscal policy expert, as Minister of Finance.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Merkel and the CDU lost ground after Kirchhof proposed the introduction of a [[flat tax]] in Germany, again undermining the party's broad appeal on economic affairs and convincing many voters that the CDU's platform of deregulation was designed to benefit only the rich. This was compounded by Merkel proposing to increase [[VAT]] to reduce Germany's deficit and fill the gap in revenue from a flat tax. The SPD were able to increase their support simply by pledging not to introduce flat taxes or increase VAT. Although Merkel's standing recovered after she distanced herself from Kirchhof's proposals, she remained considerably less popular than Schröder, and the CDU's lead was down to 9% on the eve of the election.

On 18 September 2005, Merkel's CDU/CSU and Schröder's SPD went head-to-head in the national elections, with the CDU/CSU winning 35.3% (CDU 27.8%/CSU 7.5%) of the second votes to the SPD's 34.2%. Neither the SPD-Green coalition nor the CDU/CSU and its preferred coalition partners, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]], held enough seats to form a majority in the Bundestag, and both Schröder and Merkel claimed victory. A [[grand coalition]] between the CDU/CSU and SPD faced the challenge that both parties demanded the chancellorship. However, after three weeks of [[negotiation (process)|negotiations]], the two parties reached a deal whereby Merkel would become Chancellor and the SPD would hold 8 of the 16 seats in the cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4325600.stm |title=Merkel named as German chancellor|publisher=BBC News|date=2005-10-10|accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/10/13/germany.government.ap/ CNN.com] {{Dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition deal was approved by both parties at party conferences on 14 November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4434812.stm |title=German parties back new coalition |date=November 14, 2005 |work=BBC News |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Merkel was elected Chancellor by the majority of delegates (397 to 217) in the newly assembled Bundestag on 22 November 2005, but 51 members of the governing coalition voted against her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4458430.stm |title=Merkel becomes German chancellor |work=BBC News |date=November 22, 2005 |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports had indicated that the grand coalition would pursue a mix of policies, some of which differ from Merkel's political platform as leader of the opposition and candidate for Chancellor. The coalition's intent was to cut public spending whilst increasing [[VAT]] (from 16 to 19%), [[social insurance]] contributions and the top rate of [[income tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4429518.stm |title=German coalition poised for power |date=November 11, 2005 |work=BBC News |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merkel had stated that the main aim of her government would be to reduce unemployment, and that it is this issue on which her government will be judged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4431262.stm |title=Merkel defends German reform plan |work=BBC News |date=November 12, 2005 |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chancellor of Germany==

On 22 November 2005, Merkel assumed the office of Chancellor of Germany following a [[German federal election, 2005|stalemate election]] that resulted in a [[Grand coalition (Germany)|grand coalition]] with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]].  She was [[German federal election, 2009|re-elected in 2009]] with a larger majority and was able to form a governing coalition with the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]].

On 25 September 2007, Chancellor Angela Merkel met the [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] for &quot;''private and informal talks''&quot; in Berlin in the [[German Chancellery|Chancellery]] amid protest from [[China]]. China afterwards cancelled separate talks with German officials, including talks with Justice Minister [[Brigitte Zypries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://euronews.net/index.php?page=info&amp;article=444371&amp;lng=1 |title=Euronews.net, Merkel meets with the Dalai Lama |publisher=Euronews.net |date= |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Der Spiegel'' reported that tensions between Chancellor Merkel and U.S. President Barack Obama&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,632026,00.html |title='They're Not Getting any Warmer': Merkel Faces Difficult Talks in Washington – SPIEGEL ONLINE – News – International |publisher=Spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; were eased during a meeting between the two leaders in June 2009.  Commenting on a White House Press Conference held after the meeting, ''Spiegel'' stated, &quot;Of course the rather more reserved chancellor couldn't really keep up with [Obama's]...[[charm offensive]],&quot; but to reciprocate for Obama's &quot;good natured&quot; diplomacy, &quot;she gave it a go...by mentioning the experiences of Obama's sister in Heidelberg, making it clear that she had read his autobiography&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,632961,00.html |title=A Trans-Atlantic Show of Friendship: Obama Praises His 'Friend Chancellor Merkel' – SPIEGEL ONLINE – News – International |publisher=Spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russia====
In 2006 Merkel expressed concern for [[Russia in the European energy sector|overreliance on Russian energy]], but she received little support from others in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/2008/0306/p06s01-wogn.html|title=Dependence on Russian gas worries some – but not all – European countries|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|date=2008-03-06|accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iran====
According to the news agency ''Mehr'' (as reported in the ''Mail &amp; Guardian Online'' and ''Deutsche Welle'', quoting ''AFP''), in August 2006, Merkel received a letter from President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] of [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ahmadinejad Claims Holocaust Invented to Embarrass Germany |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2149241,00.html |work=Deutsche Welle |date=2006-08-28 |accessdate=2008-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=ARESU |last=EQBALI |title=Ahmadinejad: Holocaust was made up |url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2006-08-28-ahmadinejad-holocaust-was-made-up |work=Mail and Guardian Online |date=2006-08-28 |accessdate=2008-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the reports, Merkel said that the letter contained &quot;unacceptable&quot; criticism of [[Israel]] and &quot;put in question&quot; the Jewish state's right to exist, and that therefore she would not formally respond to the letter.

====Israel====
On 16 March 2008, Merkel arrived in Israel to mark the 60th [[Yom Ha'atzmaut|anniversary of the Jewish state]]. She was greeted at the airport by Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]], an honor guard and many of the country's political and religious leaders, including most of the Israeli Cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/03/16/news/mideast.php|title=Chancellor of Germany goes to Israel|publisher=The New York Times|date=2008-03-16|accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until then, US President [[George W.

Merkel has supported Israeli diplomatic initiatives, opposing the Palestinian bid for membership at the UN. However, Merkel was offended when settlement building continued beyond the Green Line&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=202704&lt;/ref&gt;, and felt personally betrayed by the Israeli government's behavior. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=206071&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic and financial policy===
--&gt;

====Liquidity crisis====
Following [[Liquidity crisis of September 2008|major falls in worldwide stock markets in September 2008]], the German government stepped in to assist the [[mortgage loan|mortgage]] company [[Hypo Real Estate]] with a bailout which was agreed on October 6, with German banks to contribute €30 billion and the [[Deutsche Bundesbank|Bundesbank]] €20 billion to a credit line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=amxJTktF7JMs&amp;refer=home|title=Hypo Real Gets EU50 Billion Government-Led Bailout|last=Parkin|first=Brian|coauthors=Suess, Oliver|date=6 October 2008|work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 October 2008, a Saturday, following the [[Government of Ireland|Irish Government's]] decision to guarantee all deposits in private savings accounts, a move she strongly criticized,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2008/10/05/ap5510085.html|title=Germany guarantees all private bank accounts|publisher=Forbes.com|accessdate=2008-10-06|deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merkel said there were no plans for the German Government to do the same. The following day, Merkel stated that the government would guarantee private savings account deposits, after all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/05/AR2008100500816.html?hpid=sec-business|title=Germany to guarantee Private Bank Accounts|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=2008-10-06 | first=Craig | last=Whitlock | date=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, two days later, on 6 October 2008, it emerged that the pledge was simply a political move that would not be backed by legislation.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot; /&gt; Other European governments eventually either raised the limits or promised to guarantee savings in full.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7654182.stm|title=Bank uncertainty hits UK shares|publisher=BBC| accessdate=2008-10-06 | date=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
In 2011,&lt;ref name=&quot;timesofindia.indiatimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Angela-Merkel-in-India-for-joint-cabinet-meet/articleshow/8659994.cms|title=Angela Merkel in India for joint cabinet meet|publisher=The Times of India|date=2011-05-31|accessdate=2011-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; India became the first Asian country to hold a joint cabinet meeting with Germany when Merkel visited.&lt;ref name=&quot;timesofindia.indiatimes.com&quot;/&gt;

===Failure of multiculturalism===
In October 2010 Merkel told a meeting of younger members of her conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party at [[Potsdam]] that attempts to build a [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] society in Germany had &quot;utterly failed&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11559451 | work=BBC News | title=Merkel says German multicultural society has failed | date=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating: &quot;The concept that we are now living side by side and are happy about it does not work&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20101017/wl_afp/germanymuslimreligionimmigration ]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that &quot;we feel attached to the Christian concept of mankind, that is what defines us.

This has added to a growing debate within Germany&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11532699 | work=BBC News | title=Germany's charged immigration debate | date=2010-10-17|accessdate=2011-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the levels of immigration, its effect on Germany and the degree to which Muslim immigrants have integrated into German society.

===Approval===
Midway through her second term, Merkel's approval plummeted in the country, resulting in heavy losses in state elections for her party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/21/angela-merkel-crushed-hamburg-polls|title=Angela Merkel's party crushed in Hamburg poll|publisher=The Guardian|date=2011-02-21|accessdate=2011-08-23|location=London|first=Helen|last=Pidd}}&lt;/ref&gt; A poll in August 2011 found her coalition with only 36% support compared to a rival coalition which had 51%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zimbio.com/Chancellor+Angela+Merkel/articles/tvb0mRYv0RF/German+opposition+hits+11+year+high+polls|title=German opposition hits 11-year high in polls|publisher=France24|date=2011-08-05|accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she scored well on her handling of the recent euro crisis (69% rated her performance as good rather than poor), and her approval rating reached an all-time high of 77% in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/union-dank-merkel-im-umfrage-aufwind-1784909.html|title=Union dank Merkel im Umfrage-Aufwind|publisher=Stern.de|date=2012-02-10|accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cabinets==

The [[Cabinet Merkel I|first cabinet of Angela Merkel]] was sworn in at 16:00 [[Central European Time|CET]], on 22 November 2005.

On 31 October 2005, after the defeat of his favoured candidate for the position of Secretary General of the SPD, [[Franz Müntefering]] indicated that he would resign as Chairman of the party in November, which he did. Ostensibly responding to this, [[Edmund Stoiber]] (CSU), who was originally nominated for the Economics and Technology post, announced his withdrawal on 1 November 2005. While this was initially seen as a blow to Merkel's attempt at forming a viable coalition and cabinet, the manner in which Stoiber withdrew earned him much ridicule and severely undermined his position as a Merkel rival. Separate conferences of the CDU, CSU, and SPD approved the proposed Cabinet on 14 November 2005

The [[Cabinet Merkel II|second cabinet of Angela Merkel]] was sworn in on 28 October 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;cabinet2009&quot;&gt;Penfold, Chuck (2009-10-30). Merkel's new cabinet sworn in.

==Personal life==
In 1977, Angela Kasner married physics student Ulrich Merkel.

==Honours==

In 2006, Angela Merkel was awarded the [[Vision for Europe Award]] for her contribution toward greater European integration. In 2007, Merkel was awarded an [[honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afhu.org/site/press_releases/news_merkel.htm American Friends of the Hebrew University]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.huji.ac.il/htbin/hon_doc/doc_search.pl |title=Honorary Doctorates – The Hebrew University of Jerusalem |publisher=.huji.ac.il |date= |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2006, the Italian President of the Republic gave the German Chancellor the recognition of ''Dama di Gran Croce Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana''.

==Comparisons==
As a female politician from a [[centre right]] party who is also a scientist, Merkel has been compared by many in the English-language press to former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Some have referred to her as &quot;[[Iron Lady]]&quot;, &quot;Iron Girl&quot;, and even &quot;The Iron Frau&quot; (all alluding to Thatcher, whose nickname was &quot;The Iron Lady&quot;—Thatcher also has a science degree: an Oxford University degree in chemistry). Political commentators have debated the precise extent to which their agendas are similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2122001/ |title=Is Angela Merkel the next Maggie Thatcher? |work=Slate |date=July 5, 2005 |last=Risen |first=Clay |publisher=[[Slate (magazine)]] |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in her tenure, Merkel acquired the [[nickname]] &quot;''Mutti''&quot; (a familiar form of 'mother'), said by ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' to refer to an idealised mother figure from the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,659018,00.html |title=Merkel's Dream of a Place in the History Books |last=Kurbjuweit |first=Dirk |date=11 March 2009 |publisher=Spiegel Online International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being the first female German chancellor, the first to represent a Federal Republic of Germany that included the former East Germany (though she was born in the West and moved to the East a few weeks after her birth, when her father decided to return to East Germany as  a Lutheran pastor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Langguth | first = Gerd | title = Angela Merkel | year = 2005 | month = August | publisher = DTV | location = Munich | language = German | isbn = 3-423-24495-2 |page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and the youngest German chancellor since the Second World War, Merkel is also the first born after World War II, and the first chancellor of the Federal Republic with a background in natural sciences. She studied physics; her predecessors studied law, business or history or were military officers, among others.

[[Forbes]] has named her the fourth most powerful person in the world as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/powerful-people/list/|title=The World's Most Powerful People|publisher=Forbes|date=|accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Merkel has been criticised for being personally present and involved at the M100 Media Award handover&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-51367120100908 | work=Reuters | title=Merkel honours Mohammad cartoonist at press award | date=2010-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Danish [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|cartoonist]] [[Kurt Westergaard]]. This happened at a time of fierce emotional debate in Germany over disparaging remarks about Muslim immigrants made by the former [[Deutsche Bundesbank]] executive [[Thilo Sarrazin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,714643-2,00.html The Sarrazin Debate: Germany Is Becoming Islamophobic – SPIEGEL ONLINE – News – International].

A ZMD spokesman, Aiman Mazyek, told public broadcaster Deutschlandradio that the Chancellor was honouring someone &quot;who in our eyes kicked our prophet, and therefore kicked all Muslims&quot;. He said giving Mr Westergaard the prize in a &quot;highly charged and heated time&quot; was &quot;highly problematic&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11236158 | work=BBC News | title=Merkel honours Danish Muhammad cartoonist Westergaard | date=2010-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the left party&lt;ref&gt;[http://die-linke.de/nc/die_linke/nachrichten/detail/artikel/merkels-affront-gegen-muslime/ DIE LINKE: Merkels Affront gegen Muslime].

It was true that the right to freedom of expression also applies to cartoons, she said. &quot;But if a chancellor also makes a speech on top of that, it serves to heat up the debate.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,716503,00.html Award for Danish Muhammad Cartoonist: Merkel Defends Press Freedom, Condemns Koran-Burning – SPIEGEL ONLINE – News – International].

The ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine]]'' newspaper wrote: &quot;This will probably be the most explosive appointment of her chancellorship so far.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/s/Rub9B4326FE2669456BAC0CF17E0C7E9105/Doc~E6762D4CF046141829F1A9533368C843E~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html Ehrung des Mohammed-Karikaturisten: Angela Merkels Risiko – Integration – Feuilleton]. Faz.Net (2010-09-08). Retrieved on 2011-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have praised Merkel and called it a brave and bold move for the cause of freedom of speech.

In September 2010, due to a debate of integration, Merkel said to the [[Frankfurter Allgemeine]] newspaper that &quot;Germans will see more mosques&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article9716872/Merkel-Deutsche-werden-mehr-Moscheen-sehen.html Islam: Merkel – Deutsche werden mehr Moscheen sehen – Nachrichten Politik – Deutschland – WELT ONLINE].

{{PoliticsGermany}}
The '''Bundestag''' (Federal [[diet (assembly)|Diet]]; {{IPA-de|ˈbʊndəstaːk|pron}}) is a federal legislative body in [[Germany]]. In practice Germany is governed by a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[legislature]], of which the Bundestag serves as the [[lower house]] and the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] the [[upper house]]. The Bundestag was established by the German [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] of 1949, as the successor to the earlier [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]. [[Norbert Lammert]] is the current [[President of the Bundestag]].

==History==
With the dissolution of the [[German Confederation]] in 1866 and the founding of the [[German Empire]] ([[Deutsches Reich]]) in 1871, the Reichstag was established as the German parliament in Berlin. Two decades later, the current parliament building was erected. The Reichstag delegates were elected by direct and equal male suffrage (and not the three-class electoral system prevailing in Prussia until 1918). The Reichstag did not participate in the appointment of the Chancellor until the parliamentary reforms of October 1918. After the Revolution of November 1918 and the establishment of the Weimar Constitution, women were given the right to vote for (and serve in) the Reichstag, and the parliament could use the no-confidence vote to force the chancellor or any cabinet member to resign. In March 1933, one month after the [[Reichstag fire]], the then president, Paul von Hindenburg, a retired war hero, gave Hitler ultimate power through Enabling Act of 1933, he remained at the post of Federal Government Chancellor (though he called himself the Führer). After this the Reichstag met only rarely to unanimously rubber-stamp the decisions of the government. It last convened on 26 April 1942.

With the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|new constitution of 1949]], the Bundestag was established as the new (West) German parliament.  Because [[West Berlin]] was not officially under the jurisdiction of the Constitution and because of the [[Cold War]], the Bundestag met in [[Bonn]] in several different buildings, including (provisionally) a former water works facility. In addition, citizens of West Berlin were unable to vote in elections to the Bundestag, and were instead represented by 20 non-voting delegates, indirectly elected by the city's [[Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin|House of Representatives]].

The [[Bundeshaus (Bonn)|Bundeshaus in Bonn]] is the former Parliament Building of Germany. The sessions of the German Bundestag were held there from 1949 until its move to Berlin in 1999. Today it houses the [[International Congress Centre Bundeshaus Bonn]] and in the north areas the branch office of the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] (Upper House). The southern areas became part of German offices for the [[United Nations]] in 2008.

The former [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] building housed a history exhibition (Fragen an die deutsche Geschichte) and served occasionally as a conference center. The Reichstag building was also occasionally used as a venue for sittings of the Bundestag and its committees and the [[Bundesversammlung (Germany)|Bundesversammlung]], the body which elects the German Federal President. However the Soviets harshly protested against the use of the Reichstag building by institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and tried to disturb the sittings by flying supersonic jets close to the building.

Since 1999, the German parliament has again assembled in [[Berlin]] in its original [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]], which dates from the 1890s and underwent a significant renovation under the lead of British architect [[Sir Norman Foster]]. Parliamentary committees and subcommittees, public hearings and faction meetings take place in three auxiliary buildings, which surround the Reichstag building: the [[Jakob-Kaiser-Haus]], [[Paul-Löbe-Haus]] and [[Marie-Elisabeth-Lüders-Haus]].

In 2005, a small aircraft crashed close to the German parliament. It was then decided to ban private air traffic over Central Berlin.

==Tasks==
Together with the [[Bundesrat (Germany)|Bundesrat]], the Bundestag is the [[legislative branch]] of the [[Politics of Germany|German political system]].

Although most legislation is initiated by the executive branch, the Bundestag considers the legislative function its most important responsibility, concentrating much of its energy on assessing and amending the government's legislative program. The committees (see below) play a prominent role in this process. Plenary sessions provide a forum for members to engage in public debate on legislative issues before them, but they tend to be well attended only when significant legislation is being considered.

The Bundestag members are the only federal officials directly elected by the public; the Bundestag in turn elects the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] and, in addition, exercises oversight of the executive branch on issues of both substantive policy and routine administration. This check on executive power can be employed through binding legislation, public debates on government policy, investigations, and direct questioning of the chancellor or cabinet officials. For example, the Bundestag can conduct a question hour ''(Fragestunde),'' in which a government representative responds to a previously submitted written question from a member. Members can ask related questions during the question hour. The questions can concern anything from a major policy issue to a specific constituent's problem. Use of the question hour has increased markedly over the past forty years, with more than 20,000 questions being posed during the 1987-90 term. Understandably, the opposition parties are active in exercising the parliamentary right to scrutinize government actions.

One striking difference when comparing the Bundestag with the [[British Parliament]] is the lack of time spent on serving constituents in Germany. This is in part due to Germany's electoral system. A practical constraint on the expansion of constituent service is the limited personal staff of Bundestag deputies. Despite these constraints especially those deputies that are elected directly normally try to keep close contact with their constituents and to help them with their problems, particularly when they are related to federal policies or agencies.

Constituent service does also take place in the form of the Petition Committee. In 2004, the Petition Committee received over 18,000 complaints from citizens and was able to negotiate a mutually satisfactory solution to more than half of them. In 2005, as a pilot of the potential of [[internet petition]]s, a version of [[e-Petitioner]] was produced for the Bundestag. This was a collaborative project involving The [[Scottish Parliament]], [[International Teledemocracy Centre]] and the Bundestag ‘Online Services Department’.  The system was formally launched on 1 September 2005, and in 2008 the Bundestag moved to a new system based on its evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tab.fzk.de/de/brief/brief32.pdf |title=''Öffentliche Petitionen beim deutschen Bundestag - erste Ergebnisse der Evaluation des Modellversuchs'' = An Evaluation Study of Public Petitions at the German Parliament'' |accessdate=2009-06-16 |last=Trenel|first=M.|work=TAB Brief Nr 32 |publisher=Deutscher Bundestag |year=2007 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election==
[[File:Vladimir Putin in Germany 25-27 September 2001-14.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vladimir Putin]] addresses the Bundestag]]
Members serve four-year terms; elections are held every four years, or earlier in the relatively rare case that the Bundestag is dissolved prematurely by the [[President of Germany|president]]. The Bundestag can be dissolved by the president on the recommendation of the chancellor if the latter has lost a vote of confidence in the Bundestag. This has happened three times: 1972 under Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]], 1983 under Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] and 2005 under Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]].

All candidates must be at least eighteen years old; there are no term limits. The election uses the [[Mixed member proportional representation|MMP electoral system]]. In addition, the Bundestag has a minimum threshold of either 5% of the national party vote or three (directly elected) constituency representatives for a [[political party|party]] to gain additional representation through the system of proportional representation.

Thus, small minority parties cannot easily enter the Bundestag and prevent the formation of stable majority governments as they could under the Weimar constitution. Since 1961, only two new parties ([[Bündnis 90/Die Grünen]] and [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|PDS]]/[[Die Linke]]) have entered the Bundestag.

The most recent election, the [[German federal election, 2009]], was held on September 27, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawley&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,601451,00.html|title=Political Landscape in Flux ahead of 2009 Votes|last=Hawley|first=Charles|date=15 January 2009|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=2009-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distribution of seats in the Bundestag===
[[File:Bundestagswahl 05 stimmzett.jpg|thumb|right|Bundestag ballot: constituency vote on left, party list (showing top five list candidates) vote on right]]
Half of the Members of the Bundestag are elected directly from 299 constituencies ([[first-past-the-post system]]), the other half are elected from the parties’ Land lists in such a way as to achieve [[proportional representation]] for the total Bundestag (if possible).

Accordingly, each voter has two votes in the elections to the Bundestag. The first vote, allowing voters to elect their local representatives to the Bundestag, decides which candidates are sent to Parliament from the constituencies.

The second vote is cast for a party list; it determines the relative strengths of the parties represented in the Bundestag.

At least 598 Members of the Bundestag are elected in this way.  Parties that gain more than 5% of the second votes or win at least 3 direct mandates are allocated seats in the Bundestag in proportion to the number of votes it has received ([[d'Hondt method]] until 1987, [[largest remainder method]] until the 2005 election, now [[Sainte-Laguë method]]).  When the total number of mandates gained by a party has been determined, they are distributed between the Land lists. The distribution of the seats of that party to the 16 Lands is proportional to that party's second vote results in the Lands.  The first of the mandates allocated to each Land go to the candidates who have won direct mandates in that Land.  The rest are assigned in order to the candidates on the Land list put forward before the election.

In addition to this, there are certain circumstances in which some candidates win what are known as [[overhang seat]]s when the seats are being distributed.  If a party has gained more direct mandates in a Land than it is entitled to according to the results of the second vote, it does not forfeit these mandates because all directly elected candidates are guaranteed a seat in the Bundestag.

==Organization==
[[File:M E Lueders Haus 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The ''Marie-Elisabeth-Lüders-Haus'', one of the official buildings of the complex]]

===Parliamentary groups===

The most important organizational structures within the Bundestag are [[fraction (politics)|parliamentary groups]] (''Fraktionen''; sing. ''Fraktion''), which are formed by political parties represented in the chamber which incorporate more than 5% of the Bundestag legislators; [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]] have always formed a single united ''Fraktion''. The size of a party's ''Fraktion'' determines the extent of its representation on legislative committees, the time slots allotted for speaking, the number of committee chairs it can hold, and its representation in executive bodies of the Bundestag. The ''Fraktionen,'' not the members, receive the bulk of government funding for legislative and administrative activities.

The leadership of each ''Fraktion'' consists of a parliamentary party leader, several deputy leaders, and an executive committee. The leadership's major responsibilities are to represent the ''Fraktion,'' enforce party discipline, and orchestrate the party's parliamentary activities. The members of each ''Fraktion'' are distributed among [[working group]]s focused on specific policy-related topics such as social policy, economics, and foreign policy. The ''Fraktion'' meets every Tuesday afternoon in the weeks in which the Bundestag is in session to consider legislation before the Bundestag and formulate the party's position on it.

Parties which do not fulfill the criterion for being a ''Fraktion'' but have at least three seats by direct elections (i.e. which have at least three MPs representing a certain electoral district) in the Bundestag can be granted the status of a ''group'' of the Bundestag. This applied to the [[Left Party (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]] (PDS) from 1990-1998. This status entails some privileges which are in general less than those of a ''Fraktion''. In the current Bundestag, there are no such groups (the PDS had only two MPs in parliament until 2005 and could thus not even considered a group anymore; the party has now returned to the Bundestag with full ''Fraktion'' status).

===Executive bodies===

The Bundestag's executive bodies include the [[Council of Elders of the Bundestag (Germany)|Council of Elders]] and the [[Presidium of the Bundestag|Presidium]]. The council consists of the Bundestag leadership, together with the most senior representatives of each ''fraktion'', with the number of these representatives tied to the strength of the Parliamentary groups in the chamber. The council is the coordination hub, determining the daily legislative agenda and assigning committee chairpersons based on Parliamentary group representation. The council also serves as an important forum for interparty negotiations on specific legislation and procedural issues. The Presidium is responsible for the routine administration of the Bundestag, including its clerical and research activities. It consists of the chamber's president (usually elected from the largest ''fraktion'') and vice presidents (one from each ''fraktion'').

===Committees===

Most of the legislative work in the Bundestag is the product of standing committees, which exist largely unchanged throughout one legislative period.  The number of committees approximates the number of federal ministries, and the titles of each are roughly similar (e.g., defense, agriculture, and labor). Between 1987 and 1990, the term of the eleventh Bundestag, there were twenty-one standing committees. The distribution of committee chairs and the membership of each committee reflect the relative strength of the various Parliamentary groups in the chamber. In the eleventh Bundestag, the [[Christian-Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]/[[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]] chaired eleven committees, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] eight, the [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|FDP]] one, and the environmentalist party, the [[German Green Party|Greens]] (Die Grünen), one. Members of the opposition party can chair a significant number of standing committees. These committees have either a small staff or no staff at all.

==Principle of discontinuation==
As is the case with some other parliaments, the Bundestag is subject to the ''principle of discontinuation'', meaning that a newly elected Bundestag is legally regarded to be a body and entity completely different from the previous Bundestag. This leads to the result, that any motion, application or action submitted to the previous Bundestag, e.g. a bill referred to the Bundestag by the Federal Government, is regarded as completed by non-decision (German terminology: “''Die Sache fällt der Diskontinuität anheim''”). Thus any bill that has not been decided upon by the beginning of the new electoral period must to be brought up by the government again, if it aims to uphold the motion, this procedure in effect delaying the passage of the bill. Furthermore, any newly elected Bundestag will have to freshly decide on the rules of procedure (''Geschäftsordnung''), which is done by a formal decision of taking over such rules from the preceding ''Bundestag'' by reference.

Any Bundestag is considered dissolved only once a newly elected Bundestag has actually gathered in order to constitute itself (Article&amp;nbsp;39 sec.&amp;nbsp;1 sentence&amp;nbsp;2 of the Basic Law), which has to happen within 30 days of its election (Article&amp;nbsp;39 sec.&amp;nbsp;2 of the Basic Law). Thus, it may happen (and has happened) that the old Bundestag gathers and makes decisions even after the election of a new Bundestag that has not gathered in order to constitute itself. For example, elections to the 16th Bundestag took place on 18 September 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/wahlen/pm-wahl-16-dbt/pd040211.htm |title=Press Release: ''Verkürzte Fristen zur vorgezogenen Neuwahl des Deutschen Bundestages'' |accessdate=2008-10-20 |work=www.bundeswahlleiter.de |publisher=[[Federal Returning Officer|Bundeswahlleiter]] = ''Federal Director for Elections'' ([[Federal Returning Officer]]) |date= 2005-07-25}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the 15th Bundestag still convened after election day to make some decisions on German military engagement abroad,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btp/15/15187.pdf |title=''Stenographischer Bericht der 187.

The '''Chancellor of Germany''' is the [[head of government]] of [[Germany]]. The official title in [[German language|German]] is ''Bundeskanzler(-in)'' (literally, Federal Chancellor), often shortened to ''Kanzler(-in)''.

In [[Politics of Germany|German politics]] the ''Chancellor'' is equivalent to that of a [[Prime Minister]] in many other countries. The German term directly equivalent of Prime Minister, ''Ministerpräsident'', is used for the heads of government of most [[States of Germany|German states]] (referred to in [[German language|German]] as ''Länder'', literally &quot;countries&quot;) as well as foreign countries.

The current Chancellor is [[Angela Merkel]], who was re-elected in 2009 after her first election in 2005. She is the first [[female]] Chancellor. In German she is thus known as ''Bundeskanzlerin''. That particular word was never used officially before Merkel, but it is a grammatically regular formation of a noun denoting a female.

The modern office of Chancellor evolved from the position created for [[Otto von Bismarck]] in the [[North German Confederation]] in 1867; the Confederation evolved into a German nation-state with the 1871 [[Unification of Germany]]. The role of the Chancellor has varied greatly throughout Germany's modern history. Today, the Chancellor is widely considered to be the country's effective leader.

==Historical overview==
{{PoliticsGermany}}
The office of Chancellor has a long history, stemming back to the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The title was at times used in several states of German-speaking Europe. The modern office of Chancellor was established with the [[North German Confederation]], of which [[Otto von Bismarck]] became Chancellor in 1867. After the [[Unification of Germany]] in 1871, the office became known in German as ''Reichskanzler'', although it continued to be referred to as Chancellor in English. With Germany's constitution of 1949, the title ''Bundeskanzler'' was revived in German.

During the various eras, the role of the Chancellor has varied. From 1871 to 1918, the Chancellor was only responsible to the [[Emperor of Germany|Emperor]]. With the constitutional reform in 1918, the Parliament was granted the right to dismiss the Chancellor. According to the [[Weimar Constitution]] of 1919, the Chancellor was appointed by the President and responsible to Parliament. After the death of [[Paul von Hindenburg|President Hindenburg]], the Weimar Constitution was effectively set aside during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi dictatorship]]. The [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|1949 constitution]] gave the Chancellor greater powers than during the [[Weimar Republic]], while diminishing the role of the President. Germany is today often referred to as a &quot;chancellor democracy&quot;, reflecting the ''[[de facto]]'' role of the Chancellor as the country's chief executive.

Since 1867, [[List of Chancellors of Germany|33 individuals]] have served as heads of government of Germany or its predecessor, the North German Confederation, most of them with the title Chancellor.
Due to his administrative tasks, the head of the [[clergy|clerics]] at the chapel of an [[Kaiserpfalz|Imperial palace]] during the [[Carolingian Empire]] was called [[Chancellor]] (from {{lang-la|cancellarius}}). The chapel's college acted as the Emperor's [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]] issuing deeds and [[capitulary|capitularies]]. Since the days of [[Louis the German]], the [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Archbishop of Mainz]] was ''[[ex officio]]'' German [[Archchancellor]], a position he held until the end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806, while ''de jure'' the [[Electorate of Cologne|Archbishop of Cologne]] was Chancellor of [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Italy]] and the [[Electorate of Trier|Archbishop of Trier]] of [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundy]]. These three [[Prince-Bishop|Prince-Archbishops]] were also [[Prince-elector]]s of the Empire electing the [[King of the Romans]]. Already in medieval times the German Chancellor had political power like Archbishop [[Willigis]] (Archchancellor 975–1011, regent for King [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III of Germany]] 991–994) or [[Rainald of Dassel|Rainald von Dassel]] (Chancellor 1156–1162 and 1166–1167) under Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]].

In 1559 Emperor [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] established the agency of an Imperial chancellery (''Reichshofkanzlei'') at the Vienna [[Hofburg Palace]], headed by a Vice-Chancellor under the nominal authority of the Mainz archbishop. Upon the 1620 [[Battle of White Mountain]], Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] created the office of an [[Archduchy of Austria|Austrian]] Court Chancellor in charge of the internal and foreign affairs of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. From 1753 onwards, the office of an Austrian State Chancellor was held by Prince [[Wenzel Anton, Prince of Kaunitz-Rietberg|Kaunitz]]. The Imperial chancellery lost its importance, and from the days of [[Maria Theresa]] and [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] merely existed on paper. After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, Prince [[Metternich]] served as State Chancellor of the [[Austrian Empire]] (1821-1848), likewise Prince [[Karl August von Hardenberg|Hardenberg]] acted as [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] chancellor (1810-1822).

From 1867 to 1871 the title ''Bundeskanzler'' (federal chancellor) was again used in the [[German language]], during the time of the [[North German Confederation]]. From 1871 to 1945, the office was named ''Reichskanzler'' (Imperial Chancellor). Since 1949 the formal title of the office in the German language is once again ''Bundeskanzler''.

In the now defunct [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR, East Germany), which existed from 7 October 1949 to 3 October 1990 (when the territory of the former GDR was reunified with the Federal Republic of Germany), the position of Chancellor did not exist. The equivalent position was called either '''Minister President''' ''(Ministerpräsident)'' or '''Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR''' ''(Vorsitzender des [[Ministerrat]]s der DDR)''. (See [[Leaders of East Germany]].)

==Chancellor of the North German Confederation (1867–1871)==
The head of the federal government of the [[North German Confederation]], which was created on 1 July 1867, had the title ''Bundeskanzler''. The only person to hold the office was [[Otto von Bismarck]], the [[Prime Minister of Prussia]].

The King of Prussia was [[Coronation|crowned]] as German Emperor at the [[Palace of Versailles]] on 18 January 1871, however, the North German Confederation did not cease to exist until the [[Constitution of the German Empire|1871 Constitution of Germany]] went into force on 16 April. Bismarck hence remained Chancellor of the Confederation until that date. During these months, the North German Confederation was also referred to as the German Confederation, after the South German states (excluding Austria) had joined the confederation.

The Chancellor was appointed by the [[King of Prussia]] in his capacity as President of the North German Confederation. His role and powers were very similar to that of the office of Chancellor of Germany from 1871.

==Chancellor of the German Empire (1871–1918)==
In the 1871 [[German Empire]], the Chancellor served both as the Emperor's first minister, and as presiding officer of the [[Bundesrat (Germany)|Bundesrat]], the upper chamber of the German parliament. He was neither elected by nor responsible to Parliament (the ''[[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]''). Instead, the Chancellor was appointed by the Emperor.

The Federal Government consisted of
* a federal council (Bundesrat), consisting of representatives of the federal states and presided over by the King of Prussia
* a parliament, called the Reichstag
* a rudimentary federal executive, led by the Prussian [[Prime Minister]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] as Federal Chancellor in a [[personal union]].

Technically, the foreign ministers of the empire's states instructed their states' deputies to the Federal Council (Bundesrat) and therefore outranked the Chancellor. For this reason, Bismarck continued to serve as both prime minister and foreign minister of Prussia for virtually his entire tenure as chancellor of the empire, since he wanted to continue to exercise this power. Since Berlin controlled 17 votes in the Bundesrat, Bismarck could effectively control the proceedings by making deals with the smaller states.

The term Chancellor signalled the seemingly low priority of this institution compared to the governments of the states, because the new Chancellor of the Federation should not be a fully fledged prime minister, in contrast to the heads of the federal states. The title of Chancellor additionally symbolized a strong monarchic-bureaucratic and ultimately antiparliamentary component, as in the Prussian tradition of for instance [[Karl August von Hardenberg|von Hardenberg]].

In both of these aspects, the executive of the Federation resp. the Empire as it was formed in 1867/71 was deliberately different from the Imperial Ministry of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|revolutionary years 1848/49]], which had been led by a Prime Minister, who was elected by the [[National Assembly]].

In 1871, the concept of the federal chancellor was transferred to the executive of the newly formed German Empire, which now also contained the South German states. Here too, the terms of Chancellor and Federal Agency (as opposed to Ministry or Government) suggested an (apparent) lower priority of the federal executive as compared to the governments of the federal states. For this reason, neither the Chancellor nor the leaders of the imperial departments under his command used the title of [[Minister (government)|Minister]] until 1918.

The constitution of Germany was amended on 29 October 1918, when the Parliament was given the right to dismiss the Chancellor. However, the change could not prevent the outbreak of the revolution a few days later.

==Revolutionary period (1918–1919)==
On 9 November 1918, Chancellor [[Max von Baden]] handed over his office to [[Friedrich Ebert]]. Ebert continued to serve as Head of Government during the three months between the end of the German Empire in November 1918 and the first gathering of the National Assembly in February 1919, but did not use the title of Chancellor.

During that time, Ebert also served as Chairman of the ''Council of the People's Delegates'', until 29 December 1918 together with the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|Independent Social Democrat]] [[Hugo Haase]].

==Chancellor of the Weimar Republic (1919–1933)==
The office of Chancellor was continued in the [[Weimar Republic]]. The Chancellor was appointed by the President and was responsible to the Reichstag.

Under the Weimar Republic, the Chancellor was a fairly weak figure. Much like his [[Prime Minister of France|French counterpart]], he served as little more than a chairman. Cabinet decisions were made by majority vote. In fact many of the Weimar governments depended highly on the cooperation of the President, due to the difficulty of finding a majority in Parliament.

==Chancellor of the Third Reich (1933–1945)==
[[Adolf Hitler]] became Chancellor of Germany in January 1933, a point which historians agree marks the beginning of the [[Third Reich]]. Upon taking office Hitler immediately began accumulating power and changing the nature of the Chancellory. After only two months in office, and following the [[Reichstag fire|burning]] of the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] building, the Reichstag body passed the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] which gave the Chancellor full legislative powers for a period of four years – the Chancellor could introduce any law without consulting Parliament. The Chancellorship grew greater still in August 1934 when the incumbent [[President of Germany|President]] [[Paul von Hindenburg]] died. Hitler used the Enabling Act to merge the office of Chancellor with that of President to create a new office, [[Führer]]; although the offices were merged, Hitler continued to be addressed as &quot;[[Führer]] und Reichskanzler&quot; indicating that the Head of State and Head of Government were still separate positions albeit held by the same man. This separation was made more evident when in April 1945 Hitler gave instruction that upon his death the office of Führer would dissolve and there would be a new President and Chancellor. On 30 April 1945, Hitler committed suicide and was briefly succeeded as Chancellor by [[Joseph Goebbels]], as dictated in Hitler's [[Last Will and Testament]]. With Goebbels following Hitler's suicide with his own, the reins of power passed to Grand Admiral [[Karl Dönitz]] as [[President of Germany]]. Dönitz in turn appointed non-partisan conservative [[Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk|Count Schwerin von Krosigk]] as head of government with the title Leading Minister. Dönitz and Schwerin von Krosigk negotiated the surrender to the Allies.

==Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany (since 1949)==
{{Main|Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)}}

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right; float:right; margin-left:5px&quot;&gt;{{Timeline federal chancellors of Germany}}&lt;/div&gt;
The 1949 German [[constitution]], the [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] (''Grundgesetz''), invests the Chancellor (German, ''Bundeskanzler'') with broad powers to initiate government policy. For that reason, some observers refer to the German political system as a &quot;chancellor democracy&quot;. Whichever major party (CDU/CSU or SPD) does not hold the chancellorship usually calls its leading candidate for the federal election &quot;[[chancellor-candidate]]&quot; (''Kanzlerkandidat''). The Federal Government (''Bundesregierung'') consists of the Chancellor and his or her [[Cabinet of Germany|cabinet ministers]].

[[File:07.08.21.Bundeskanzleramt.jpg|thumb|left|The Chancellor's Office in Berlin]]

The chancellor's authority emanates from the provisions of the Basic Law and in practice from his or her status as leader of the [[political party|party]] (or coalition of parties) holding a majority of seats in the ''[[Bundestag]]'' (federal parliament). With the exception of [[Helmut Schmidt]], the chancellor has usually also been chairman of his or her own party. This was the case with Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] from 1999 until he resigned the chairmanship of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] in 2004.

The German Chancellor is officially addressed as &quot;Herr Bundeskanzler&quot; if the Chancellor is a man. The current female Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] is officially addressed as &quot;Frau Bundeskanzlerin&quot;, the female form of the title. Use of the mixed form &quot;Frau Bundeskanzler&quot; was deprecated by the government in 2004 because it is regarded as impolite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.n-tv.de/589342.html &quot;Frau Bundeskanzler&quot; oder ... &quot;Frau Bundeskanzlerin&quot;? – n-tv.de&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Christian Democratic Union of Germany''' ({{lang-de|Christlich Demokratische Union Deutschlands}}, CDU; {{IPA-de|ˈkʁɪstlɪç ˌdemoˈkʁaːtɪʃə uˈni̯oːn ˈdɔʏtʃlants}}) is a [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] and [[conservatism|conservative]] political party in [[Germany]].  It is regarded as on the [[centre-right]] of the German political spectrum. Along with its [[Bavaria]]n sister party, the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]], the CDU forms the [[CDU/CSU]] grouping, also known as the Union, in the [[Bundestag]].

The leader of the party, [[Angela Merkel]], is the current [[Chancellor of Germany]].  The CDU is a member of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP), and sits in the [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|EPP Group]] in the [[European Parliament]].  Internationally, the CDU is a member of the [[Centrist Democrat International]] and the [[International Democrat Union]].  The CDU is the largest political party in Germany, followed by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]].

==Party platform==
The CDU is Christian-based, applying the principles of [[Christian democracy]] and emphasising the &quot;Christian understanding of humans and their responsibility toward God.&quot; CDU membership consists however of people adhering to a variety of religions as well as non-religious individuals. The CDU's policies derive from [[Political Catholicism]], [[Catholic social teaching]] and political [[Protestantism]], as well as [[fiscal conservatism]] and [[national conservatism]]. The CDU was the first proponent of the [[social market economy]], although the party has adopted more [[economic liberalism|liberal economics]] policies since [[Helmut Kohl]]'s term in office as the Chancellor of Germany (1982–1998). In terms of foreign policy, the CDU commits itself to [[European integration]] and a strong relation with the [[United States|USA]]. In the [[European Union]], and opposes the entry of [[Turkey]] into the EU, preferring instead a privileged partnership with [[Turkey]]. In addition to citing various human rights violations, the CDU also believes that Turkey's unwillingness to recognise [[Cyprus]] as an independent, sovereign state contradicts the EU policy that its members must recognise the existence of one another. Domestically, the CDU emphasises curtailing [[red tape]] and the preservation of cultural traditions.

Opponents of the CDU are the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), the [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] party and [[Alliance '90/The Greens]]. The CDU has however governed in two [[grand coalition (Germany)|Grand Coalition]]s with the SPD as well as in various coalitions with the Alliance '90/The Greens. The CDU rejects coalitions with The Left and extremist right-wing parties.

The [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP), a [[conservative liberalism|conservative-liberal]] party, is the preferred partner of any CDU government since the CDU and FDP have similar attitudes towards [[fiscal policy]]. As a [[conservatism|conservative]] party, the CDU supports stronger punishments of crimes and supports involvement on the part of the [[Bundeswehr]] in cases of domestic [[Counter-terrorism|anti-terrorism]] offensives as well as in natural catastrophes. In terms of immigrants, the CDU supports initiatives to integrate immigrants through language courses, and aims to further control immigration. [[Multiple citizenship|Dual citizenship]] should only be allowed in exceptional cases.

==History==
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F019970-0020, Düsseldorf, CDU-Bundesparteitag, Adenauer, Erhard.jpg|thumb|Party convention, Düsseldorf 1965]]

Immediately following the collapse of the [[Nazi]] [[dictatorship]] at the end of [[World War II]], the need for a new political order in [[Germany]] was imminent. Simultaneous yet unrelated meetings began occurring throughout Germany, each with the intention of planning a “Christian-democratic party.” The “Christlich-Demokratische Union” was established in [[Berlin]] on 26 June 1945, and in [[Rheinland]] and [[Westfalen]] in September of the same year.
[[File:CDU Wahlkampfplakat - kaspl017.JPG|left|thumb|Poster for the CDU, 1957. &quot;No
experiments&quot;.]]
The founding members of the CDU consisted primarily of former members of the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], [[German Democratic Party]], [[German National People’s Party]], and [[German People’s Party]]. Many of these individuals, including CDU-Berlin founder [[Andreas Hermes]] and future chancellor of Germany [[Konrad Adenauer]], were imprisoned for the involvement in the [[German Resistance]] during the Nazi dictatorship. 

One of the lessons learned from the failure of the [[Weimar Republic]] was that disunity among the democratic parties ultimately allowed for the rise of the [[Nazi Party]]. It was therefore crucial to create a unified party of Christian Democrats – a Christian Democratic ‘’Union’’. The result of these meetings was the establishment of an interconfessional ([[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] alike) party influenced heavily by the political tradition of [[liberal conservatism]]. The CDU experienced considerable success gaining support from the time of its creation in Berlin on 26 June 1945 until its first [[political convention|convention]] on 21 October 1950, at which Chancellor Adenauer was named the first [[Chairman]] of the party.

The CDU was the dominant party for the first two decades following the establishment of [[West Germany]] in 1949. Konrad Adenauer remained the party’s leader until 1963, at which point former minister of economics [[Ludwig Erhard]] replaced him. As the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP) withdrew from the governing coalition in 1966 due to disagreements over fiscal and economic policy, Erhard was forced to resign. Consequently, a [[grand coalition]] with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) took over government under CDU Chancellor [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]].

The SPD quickly gained popularity and succeeded in forming a [[social-liberal coalition]] with the FDP following the [[German federal election, 1969|1969 federal election]], forcing the CDU out of power for the first time in their history. The CDU continued its role as [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] until 1982, when the FDP’s withdrawal from the coalition with the SPD allowed the CDU to regain power. CDU Chairman [[Helmut Kohl]] became the new Chancellor of West Germany and his CDU-FDP coalition was confirmed in the [[German federal election, 1983|1983 federal election]]. Public support for the coalition’s work in the process of [[German reunification]] was reiterated in the [[German federal election, 1990|1990 federal election]], in which the CDU-FDP governing coalition experienced a clear victory.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-0518-028, Staatsvertrag BRD-DDR, Helmut Kohl, Lothar de Maizière.jpg|thumb|East German CDU leader [[Lothar de Maizière]] (left) with West German CDU leader Helmut Kohl, September 1990]]

After the [[Die Wende|collapse]] of the [[East Germany|East German]] government in 1989, Kohl – supported by the governments of [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]] – called for [[German reunification]]. On 3 October 1990, the German Democratic Republic (GDR) was abolished and its territory re-annexed by West Germany. The [[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|East German CDU]] merged with its West German counterpart, and elections were held for the reunified country. Although Kohl was re-elected, the party began losing much of its popularity because of an economic recession in the former GDR and increased taxes in the west. The CDU was, however, able to win the [[German federal election, 1994|1994 federal election]] by a narrow margin due to an economic recovery.

Helmut Kohl served as chairman until the party's electoral defeat in 1998, when he was succeeded by [[Wolfgang Schäuble]]; Schäuble resigned in early 2000 as a result of a party [[1999 CDU contributions scandal|financing scandal]] and was replaced by [[Angela Merkel]], who remains the leader of the CDU to this day. In the [[German federal election, 1998|1998 federal election]], the CDU polled 28.4% and the CSU 6.7% of the national vote, which was the lowest result for CDU/CSU since 1949. Thus, a [[Red-green alliance|Red-Green coalition]] under the leadership of Gerhard Schröder took power until 2005. In 2002, the CDU and CSU polled slightly higher – 29.5% and 9.0%, respectively – but still lacked the majority needed for a CDU-FDP coalition government.

In 2005 early elections were called after the CDU dealt the governing SPD a major blow, winning more than ten state elections, most of which were [[List of landslide victories|landslide victories]]. The resulting [[grand coalition]] between the CDU/CSU and the SDP faced a serious challenge stemming from both parties’ demand for the chancellorship. After three weeks of negotiations, however, the two parties reached a deal whereby CDU received the chancellorship while the SPD retained 8 of the 16 seats in the cabinet and a majority of the most prestigious cabinet posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4325600.stm | work=BBC News | title=Merkel named as German chancellor | date=October 10, 2005 | accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/10/13/germany.government.ap/ | work=CNN}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition deal was approved by both parties at party conferences on November 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4434812.stm | work=BBC News | title=German parties back new coalition | date=November 14, 2005 | accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merkel was confirmed as the first female Chancellor of Germany by the majority of delegates (397 to 217) in the newly assembled Bundestag on 22 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4458430.stm | work=BBC News | title=Merkel becomes German chancellor | date=November 22, 2005 | accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the CDU/CSU lost support in the [[German federal election, 2009|2009 federal elections]], the FDP experienced the best election cycle in their history, thereby enabling a CDU/CSU-FDP coalition. This marked the first change of coalition partner by a Chancellor in German history.

==Internal structure==
===Members===
A May 2011 study by the [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]] concluded that the CDU currently has 499,646 members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Die Mitglieder der CDU&quot;&gt;Die Mitglieder der CDU: [http://www.kas.de/wf/de/33.12166/ Studie by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; Of those nearly half-million members, 25.4 % of members are female and 74.6 % male. Female participation is higher in the former [[East Germany|East German]] states with 29.2 % compared to 24.8% in the former [[West Germany|West German]] states.

Before 1966, membership totals in CDU organisation were only estimated. The numbers after 1966 are based on the total from 31 December of the previous year.

===Party strongholds===
The traditional strongholds of the party are concentrated in rural and [[Catholic]] regions such as the [[Eifel]], [[Münsterland]], [[Sauerland]], [[Fulda (district)|Fulda]] district, [[Emsland]], [[Oldenburger Münsterland]], the [[Thuringia]] [[Eichsfeld]] as well as areas in [[Nordfriesland]],  [[Saxony]], [[Swabia|Schwaben]], [[Vorpommern]], [[Taunus]], and smaller cities such as [[Baden-Baden]], [[Konstanz]], and [[Pforzheim]]. There is less support in [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]], [[Brandenburg]], and East [[Berlin]].

===Relationship with the CSU===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Angela Merkel]] --&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F074010-0033, Köln, Deutschlandtag Junge Union.jpg|thumb|''Germany Day'' of Junge Union in Cologne, 1986]]
Both the CDU and the [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria]] (CSU) originated after World War II, sharing a concern for the Christian worldview. In the Federal Parliament (Bundestag), the CDU is represented in a common faction with the CSU. This faction is called [[CDU/CSU]] or, informally, &quot;the Union;&quot; its basis is a binding agreement known as a ''Fraktionsvertrag'' between the two parties.

The CDU and CSU share a common youth organisation: [[Junge Union]].

On issues of federal policies the CDU and CSU don't differ{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, but they remain legally and organisationally separate parties. The social differences between the CDU and the somewhat more [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] CSU have sometimes been a source of conflict in the past. The most notable and serious such incident was in 1976, when the CSU under [[Franz Josef Strauß]] ended the alliance with the CDU at a party conference in Wildbad Kreuth. This decision was reversed shortly thereafter when the CDU threatened to run candidates against the CSU in Bavaria.

The relationship of CDU to the CSU has historic parallels to previous [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] parties in Germany, with the Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] having served as a national Catholic party throughout the ''[[German Empire|Kaiserreich]]'' and the [[Weimar Republic]] with the [[Bavarian People's Party]] functioning as the Bavarian variant.

===Konrad Adenauer Foundation===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F053560-0013, Rhöndorf, Sitzung Stiftung Adenauer-Haus.jpg|thumb|Conference in [[Rhöndorf]], with eminent historian [[Golo Mann]] (center), 1978]]
The [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]] is the think-tank of the CDU. It is named after the first Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany and first president of the CDU. The foundation offers political education, conducts scientific fact-finding research for political projects, grants scholarships to gifted individuals, researches the history of [[Christian democracy]], and supports and encourages [[European integration|European unification]], international understanding, and development-policy cooperation. Its annual budget amounts to around 120 million Euro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kas.de/upload/dokumente/jahresbericht2010/Namen.pdf 2010 Annual Report] p.93 (''German'')&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special organizations===
Notable suborganisations of the CDU are:
* [[Junge Union]] (JU), the common youth organisation of the CDU and the CSU
* [[Christian Democratic Employees' Association]] (CDA), a traditionally leftist association representing Christian Democratic wage-earners
* [[Evangelical Working Group of the CDU/CSU]] (EAK, together with the CSU), representing the Protestant minority in the party
* [[Association of Christian Democratic Students]] (RCDS), the student organisation of the party

'''Christian Wilhelm Walter Wulff''' ({{IPA-de|ˈkʁɪstjan ˈvɪlhɛlm ˈvaltɐ vʊlf}}; born {{Nowrap|19 June}} 1959) is a German politician and lawyer. He served as the [[President of Germany|President]] of [[Germany]] from 2010 to 2012. A member of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]], he served as [[Prime Minister of Lower Saxony|Prime Minister]] of the [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Lower Saxony]] from 2003 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webcitation.org/5qtE0i9xO Curriculum vitae of Prime Minister Christian Wulff – Office of the Prime Minister]&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected President in the 30 June 2010 [[German presidential election, 2010|presidential election]], defeating opposition candidate [[Joachim Gauck]] and taking office immediately,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Christian Wulff zum Bundespräsidenten gewählt|publisher=Official Website of German Bundestag|date=30 June 2010|url=http://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2010/30377887_kw25_bundesversammlung_nachher/index.jsp|accessdate=30 June 2010|quote=Mit der Annahme der Wahl hat Wulff zugleich sein neues Amt angetreten.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he was not sworn in until {{Nowrap|2 July.}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloomberg&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Buergin|first1=Rainer|last2=Parkin|first2=Brian|title=Merkel's Presidential Candidate Wulff Wins in Third-Round Vote|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=30 June 2010|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-30/merkel-s-presidential-candidate-wulff-wins-in-third-round-vote.html|accessdate=30 June 2010|quote=Wulff, who is married with one daughter and a son, will be sworn in on 2 July.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 February 2012, Wulff resigned as President of Germany, facing the prospect of prosecution for allegations of corruption relating to his prior service as Prime Minister of Lower Saxony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/9088324/Blow-to-Merkel-as-German-president-resigns.html |title=Blow to Merkel as German president resigns |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=17 February 2012 |last=Waterfield |first=Bruno}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education ==
Wulff was born in [[Osnabrück]] and is [[Roman Catholicism in Germany|Roman Catholic]]. He was the first Roman Catholic to hold the post of President of Germany since [[Heinrich Lübke]] (1959–1969).&lt;ref name=&quot;common-talk.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.common-talk.com/cms/node/9937 |title=Germany’s new president Christian Wulff embracing his second wife &amp;#124; Language Creates Value |publisher=Common-talk.com |date=16 July 2010 |accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father left the family, and he grew up with his mother. As a teenager, he took responsibility for the care of his younger sister, after his mother developed [[multiple sclerosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kleinezeitung.at/nachrichten/politik/aussenpolitik/2366743/christian-wulff-sieht-sich-nicht-alpha-tier.story|title=Christian Wulff im Porträt|work=[[Kleine Zeitung]]|date=30 June 2010|accessdate=8 July 2010|language=G4erman}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his [[Abitur]] at the [[Ernst Moritz Arndt]] [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] in Osnabrück, Wulff studied law with a specialisation in economics at the [[University of Osnabrück]]. He joined the Christian Democratic Union of Germany in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/german/germ_1949a/wulff.php |title=Biography of Wulff, Christian |publisher=Archontology.org |accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 and 1990, he passed the first and second state examinations in law, and has since worked as an attorney.

==Political career==
Since 1975, Wulff has been a member of the CDU. From 1978 to 1980, he served as federal chairman of the ''Schülerunion'', a political high school student organization affiliated with the Christian Democrats. From 1979 to 1983, he was on the executive board of the [[Junge Union]] and became its regional chairman in [[Lower Saxony]] in 1983. However, he decided to resign from the board in order to pursue his law degree, which he completed in 1986. The same year, he was elected a city councillor in his hometown. Since 1984, he has sat on the CDU's regional party council of Lower Saxony, serving as its chairman since 1994.

The Christian Democrats made Wulff candidate for Premier in the run-up of the 1994 Legislative Assembly elections. However, the popular incumbent [[Gerhard Schröder]] won and secured an absolute majority in the Lower Saxony legislature, leading some observers to doubt the wisdom of the provincial party nominating a young and neophyte candidate for Premier. After four years in opposition, the 1998 legislative assembly election brought another opportunity for Wulff to become Premier. Indeed, the federal Christian Democrat party, led by Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]], pinned their hopes on Wulff – a Wulff victory would have stopped the inevitable rise of Schröder to the Social Democrat nomination for Chancellor. However, supported by a wave of sympathy for his candidacy for chancellor in the 1998 federal election, Schröder was returned to power by an enhanced majority – leaving Wulff to serve five more years as provincial leader of the opposition.

Schröder won the 1998 federal election, leaving the post of Premier to his anointed successor, Interior minister [[Gerhard Glogowski]]. The latter soon stumbled over a scandal involving free travel paid by [[TUI AG|TUI]] and was succeeded by [[Sigmar Gabriel]]. In the wake of the 1999 scandal, as well as rising discontent with Schröder's federal cabinet, the Christian Democrats rose in the opinion polls and became a serious contender for power in the 2003 assembly election.

Wulff has been one of the four deputy chairmen of the CDU party at the federal level since {{Nowrap|7 November}} 1998, and has been a board member of the [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]] since 2003.

===2003 state election===
With Lower Saxony announcing deeper cuts of education and municipal services, the stage was set for the 2003 election campaign. Wulff entered the race as the favourite to win the election and essentially campaigned on a platform of fiscal restraint and clear-cut reforms in the areas of law enforcement and education. Both issues were decisive in the assembly elections that led to a change in fortunes for the two major parties. The Christian Democrats, in the political wilderness since the 1990 Schröder victory, were returned to power in the Legislative Assembly, gaining 48.3% of the vote. Wulff was sworn in as Premier on {{Nowrap|4 March}} 2003, as the head of a coalition between centre-right Christian Democrats and liberal Free Democrats ([[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]).

===Policies===
[[File:CFK_y_Christian_Wulff.jpg|thumb|200px|With President of Argentina [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner|Cristina Fernández]].]]
As Premier, Wulff pursued a multitude of reforms, including a restructuring of the primary education system in Lower Saxony, as well as an increase of police officers on the beat. When Wulff took office, Lower Saxony faced a severe budget crisis, resulting from years of public deficits. Painful cuts to public expenditure were enacted and implemented against considerable political resistance. The measures included cuts in university funding and in benefits for the blind. Other policies concern the reform of the administration (especially the abolition of certain district authorities). Budgetary problems have continued to overshadow Wulff's policies, albeit with somewhat less pressure. Many measures have remained controversial.

Prior to the [[German federal election, 2005|2005 Federal Election]], Wulff had been mentioned as a potential candidate for the German chancellorship. Surprisingly, in a spring 2005 poll, 28 percent of all respondents named Wulff as their preferred candidate for the Christian Democrat nomination for Chancellor in the 2006 election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.n24.de/politik/inland/index.php/a2004120109373045486 n24.de] {{de icon}} {{dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Wulff only began his first term as Premier in early 2003, he is likely to dismiss such speculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftd.de/pw/de/1102146523308.html?nv=cpm|title=In der Ruhe liegt die Kraft|first=Peter|last=Ehrlich|work=[[Financial Times Deutschland]]|date=8 December 2004|accessdate=8 July 2010|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speculation had particularly increased since the December 2004 Christian Democrat federal convention in Düsseldorf, when Wulff was re-elected deputy leader of the federal party with roughly 86 per cent of all delegates supporting him. However, the premature dissolution of the Bundestag in 2005 and the subsequent election of [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] has largely put an end to further speculation about Wulff's future.

A Wulff candidacy for the CDU nomination for Chancellor was seen to appeal to northerners and liberals within the Christian Democrats. Outside the mold of a typical conservative, he may have been able to attract swing voters disillusioned with the slowness of reforms, as well as the rather high rates of unemployment in Germany. Indeed, the Premier worked on increasing his visibility beyond Lower Saxony's confines, particularly by appearing frequently on TV shows and giving interviews to the national newspapers. Moreover, Wulff is also acquiring a profile on a broad range of issues, including the reform of the German language, Medicare and social security reform, as well as a modernisation of Germany's federal constitution, the ''Grundgesetz''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/s/Rub6EAA9BF249C249FE86A5EFF3F83DC130/Doc~E339323623A95412081F4B5DEC6308A30~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html|title=Wie macht das bloß der Wulff?|work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|date=21 October 2004|accessdate=8 July 2010|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the Premier recently criticised the consensus reached between the Christian Democrat and Social Democrat parties on the modernisation of Germany's constitution, stating that he felt that the provinces had not been given sufficient powers to deal with their own affairs. Wulff has also taken a conservative stand on nuclear energy, advocating an extension of the deadlines for the decommissioning of Germany's nuclear reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesschau.de/aktuell/meldungen/0,1185,OID5113864_REF2,00.html|title=Auch Wulff fordert längere Laufzeiten|work=[[Tagesschau (Germany)|Tagesschau]]|date=6 January 2006|accessdate=8 July 2010|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech, Wulff also expressed his opposition to euthanasia and warned of a retreat of moral values. This can be seen as the first attempt to formulate a value-based agenda for the 2008 legislative assembly, and more importantly, the 2009 federal elections. In this context, it is important to note that Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] had been severely criticized for a lack of emotional warmth during the 2005 federal election campaign, leading to a worse-than-expected result for the Christian Democrats.

Wulff announced on 8 January that Lower Saxony would become the first province to approve a new model according to which the government will temporarily pay part of the salaries for low-salary jobs, if the employers concerned are willing to employ an employee concerned on a long-term basis. This pilot is supposed to make new jobs more affordable in Germany's notoriously high-wages environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welt.de/print-welt/article189672/Niedersachsen_fuehrt_Kombilohn_ein.html|title=Niedersachsen führt Kombilohn ein|first=Stefan|last=von Borstel|work=[[Die Welt]]|date=9 January 2006|accessdate=8 July 2010|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wulff and the 2005 federal elections===
Due to his popularity in Lower Saxony, and in federal opinion polls, Wulff was considered to be a contender for the office of Chancellor.

After the 23 May announcement that federal elections were to be advanced to [[German federal election, 2005|September 2005]], Wulff announced that he was not a candidate for the Christian Democrat nomination for Chancellor, particularly as he had not completed his first term as Premier of Lower Saxony. Instead, Wulff declared his support for [[Angela Merkel]], the CDU leader in the Bundestag. Although there was speculation that Wulff would be given a position in the new government, entering federal politics, he remained Premier of Lower Saxony.

===President of Germany===
Christian Wulff was elected [[President of Germany]] on {{Nowrap|30 June}} 2010, winning 625 of 1242 votes on the third ballot of the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundespraesident.de/en www.bundespraesident.de] [[Bundespräsidialamt]], Presse- und Öffentlichkeitsarbeit. Retrieved 1 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He became Germany's youngest president at the age of 51.&lt;ref name=&quot;common-talk.com&quot;/&gt; Wulff was sworn in on {{Nowrap|2 July}} 2010 in front of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat.

His main contender in the election was [[Joachim Gauck]], a [[civil rights]] activist from [[East Germany]] and a former [[Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Archives]]. Himself not a member of any party, Gauck was nominated by the opposition [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] and [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Greens]] as their presidential candidate on {{Nowrap|3 June}}.

Wulff was succeeded as Premier of Lower Saxony by [[David McAllister (politician)|David McAllister]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.manager-magazin.de/politik/artikel/0,2828,703986,00.html {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Wulff's candidacy for President of Germany in the [[German presidential election, 2010|2010 presidential election]] was formally confirmed by [[Angela Merkel]], [[Guido Westerwelle]] and [[Horst Seehofer]], the heads of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]], [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]] parties, during the evening of {{Nowrap|3 June}} 2010.

In August 2011 President Wulff opened an economists' conference on with a speech on the euro. He criticized the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB), which had entered a second round of bond buy-ups from heavily indebted euro-zone nations, calling the plan to stabilize the [[euro]] &quot;legally and politically questionable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,782375,00.html The German President Is 'Behaving Like a Populist']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scandals and resignation===
In December 2011, allegations emerged over President Christian Wulff’s former ties with affluent businessmen. While he was still Premier of Lower Saxony, the state parliament inquired whether Wulff had any business ties with friend and millionaire entrepreneur Egon Geerkens. He denied that he had, concealing that he had received a private loan of some €500,000 from Geerkens' wife Edith in 2008 to purchase a house. Geerkens even admitted to managing the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,804631,00.html|title='President Wulff Lied'|publisher=[[Spiegel Online]] International|date=12 December 2011|accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 22 December, Wulff made a public statement apologizing for his handling of the loan affair and conceded that he should have made his personal records available more quickly. &quot;That was not straightforward and I am sorry,&quot; he added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,805409,00.html|title=German President Apologizes for Handling of Loan Affair|publisher=Spiegel Online International|date=22 December 2011|accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just when the affair seemed to settle down, it was revealed that President Wulff had applied undue pressure on [[Springer Press]] to delay or even prevent initial revelations on the loan scandal until he was back from a visit abroad. When Wulff found out that the ''[[BILD]]'' tabloid was going to break the story, he called editor-in-chief [[Kai Diekmann]], but only reached his voice mail and left a message in which he angrily threatened a &quot;final break&quot; in relations with the Springer publishing house and to take legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,806665,00.html|title=President Accused of Threatening Tabloid Newspaper|publisher=Spiegel Online International|date=1 January 2012|accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the beginning of January 2012, President Wulff lost support by the public, commentators called for him to resign, the opposition increased pressure again, and his own party was distancing itself from him for his attempted censure of freedom of the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,806899,00.html|title='Wulff Has Destroyed His Last Remnants of Credibility'|publisher=Spiegel Online International|date=3 January 2012|accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of 4 January 2012, Wulff gave a much anticipated interview in a program broadcast jointly by the two main public TV stations [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] and [[ZDF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ardmediathek.de/ard/servlet/content/3517136?documentId=9181010|title=Das Interview mit Bundespräsident Christian Wulff (original German)|publisher=[[ARD (broadcaster)]]|date=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He declared that he wanted to stay in office and that the call to Diekmann had been a &quot;serious mistake&quot; that was &quot;unworthy&quot; of a president and for which he had already apologised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundespraesident.de/SharedDocs/Berichte/DE/Reisen-und-Termine/2012/01/120104-Interview.html|title=Fernseh-Interview von Bundespräsident Christian Wulff|publisher=Office of the Federal President|date=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thelocal.de/politics/20120104-39917.html|title=President Wulff clings on|publisher=The Local|date=4 January 2012|accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the sake of transparency, he further promised to have his office publish the responses to some 400 recent press inquiries online and initially posted a summary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redeker.de/main-V2.php/de/news/pm20120105.html|title=Zusam­menfassende Stellungnahme zu den Medienanfragen an Christian Wulff (in German)|publisher=Redeker Sellner Dahs law office for the Office of the Federal President|date=5 January 2012|accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but then revoked his promise a few days later, citing confidentiality issues and organizational difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://faz.net/aktuell/politik/affaere-des-bundespraesidenten-wulffs-antworten-werden-doch-nicht-veroeffentlicht-11599816.html|title=Antworten auf 400 Fragen an Wulff bleiben geheim (in German)|publisher=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|date=10 January 2012|accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a week however, several newspapers began making use of their right to publish their own enquiries with the respective responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,808822,00.html|title=German President Blasted by Party Allies|publisher=Spiegel Online International|date=12 January 2012|accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article13812449/Die-Welt-veroeffentlicht-alle-Fragen-zur-Causa-Wulff.html|title=Die &quot;Welt&quot; veröffentlicht alle Fragen zur Causa Wulff (in German)|work=[[Die Welt]]|accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 January, Wulff’s lawyer announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redeker.de/main-V2.php/de/news/pm20120118.html|title=Veröffentlichung der Journalistenanfragen an Christian Wulff und der gegebenen Antworten (in German)|publisher=Redeker Sellner Dahs law office for the Office of the Federal President|date=18 January 2012|accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and presented online transcripts of legally released journalists’ questions and their respective answers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdf.redeker.de/|title= Erläuternde Hinweise zur Veröffentlichung der Journalistenanfragen an Christian Wulff und der gegebenen Antworten (in German)|publisher=Redeker Sellner Dahs law office for the Office of the Federal President|date=18 January 2012|accessdate=1 February 2012}} transcript files are listed at bottom of page&lt;/ref&gt;

As more allegations of possible corruption emerged, the prosecutors in [[Hanover]], the capital city of the state of Lower Saxony, sought the Bundestag to lift Wulff’s immunity as President to investigate possible granting and/or accepting of undue advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17072479|title=German President Wulff quits in home loan scandal|publisher=BBC|date=17 February 2012|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-empting this, Wulff resigned on 17 February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,815910,00.html|title= German President Resigns – Wulff Announces He Will Step Down|publisher=Spiegel Online International|date=17 January 2012|accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a reason for his resignation, Wulff stated that &quot;(the German people's) trust and thus his effectiveness have been seriously damaged&quot; and that &quot;for this reason it is no longer possible for him to exercise the office of president at home and abroad as required.&quot; The media reaction stressed that Wulff's resignation was inevitable&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/02/2012217101341425171.html |title=German president quits over scandal – Europe |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=4 October 2011 |accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it presented another challenge for Merkel, who will have to find another candidate amidst the Eurozone crisis.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

'''Claudia Nolte''' was born Claudia Wiesemüller on February 7, 1966 in [[Rostock]], a town that then lay in [[East Germany]]. Nolte became a [[Germany|German]] [[politician]] of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] party (CDU), becoming the youngest cabinet minister in German history whilst in office from 1994&amp;ndash;98. She was [[Bundestag|Federal Minister]] for family, seniors, women and youth affairs and has been President of the European Union Council of Ministers. Claudia is a Catholic and is active in the Catholic community. She is married to investigative journalist David Crawford of [[The Wall Street Journal]]. With her marriage in July 2008, she changed her name to Claudia Crawford.

==Childhood ==
Claudia Wiesemüller was born in 1966 and in her teenage years was refused admission to a college preparatory school due to her participation in Catholic church youth activities. East German school officials required her to learn a trade before she could enroll in college, so whilst attending a technical [[secondary school]] in Rostock, she took vocational training in marine electronics from 1982 to 1984.

==Entry into politics==
In 1985, Nolte studied automation and [[cybernetic]] engineering at the [[Technische Universität Ilmenau|Technical University of Ilmenau]], where she graduatated with a [[Diplom]] degree in 1990. In October 1989 she was active in the opposition movement [[Neues Forum|New Forum]] within the [[German Democratic Republic]] and joined the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in February 1990. After completing her studies at the Technical University of Ilmenau, she accepted a position as a research assistant there but left this job within weeks owing to her election to the first freely elected East German parliament. 

==Political office==
From March to October 1990, Nolte was a member of the parliament of the German Democratic Republic, or East Germany. After German unification on October 3, 1990 she joined the [[Bundestag]] where she served from 1991 to 1994 as her party's spokeswoman on women's policy. From 1992 to 1994 she was a member of Thuringia CDU.

On November 18, 1994, Nolte became the minister for family, senior citizens and youth. She was 28 years old, making her the youngest German cabinet minister in German history. On November 30, 1994 she was named the European Union Council of Ministers President &amp;ndash; again the youngest ever. In 1998 she left the German cabinet when her party joined the opposition. From 1996 to 2000 Nolte was a member of the CDU presiding council in Germany and from January 1999 to October 2002 she was commissioner of the CDU/CSU-fraction for disabled people.

From 2002 to 2005, Nolte was vice chairman for [[United Nations]] contacts in the German parliament. In 2005 she failed to win a direct seat in the Bundestag representing the Gotha Ilm county electoral district. Under Germany's electoral law she was eligible to return to the German Federal Parliament via the state list in May 2008, but she declined.

==Later career==
In January 2006, Nolte moved to [[Belgrade]] where she directed the activities of a political foundation, heading the [[Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung]] offices in Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo. In April 2010 she moved to [[London]] where she heads (as of 2010) the activities of the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung offices in the United Kingdom and Ireland.

She is a member of the German American Society, Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung, [[Christlich-Demokratische Arbeitnehmerschaft]] (CDA) and of CDU/CSU's association of medium-sized businesses ''Mittelstands- und Wirtschaftsvereinigung'' (MIT).

'''Democratic Awakening''' (''{{lang-de|Demokratischer Aufbruch}}'') was an [[East Germany|East German]] opposition political movement. It was founded in October 1989, based on existing politically active church groups. Founding members included Wolfgang Schnur, [[Friedrich Schorlemmer]], [[Rainer Eppelmann]], [[Günter Nooke]] and [[Thomas Welz]]. The organisation was officially transformed into a political party on December 16/17, 1989 in [[Leipzig]]. The party convention adopted a more conservative program than some of the founding members, like Schorlemmer, were willing to bear, so they left the party. Others, like Nooke, who left some time later, resented the growing cooperation with [[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of East Germany]], which had formerly been a party in the socialist dominated democratic block of parties and mass organisations and had supported the totalitarian regime. 

Democratic Awakening now supported rapid [[German reunification]] and formed part of the [[Alliance for Germany]] (''Allianz für Deutschland'') with CDU and [[German Social Union (East Germany)|DSU]] for the [[East German general election, 1990|1990 Volkskammer elections]] on March 18. Only a few days prior to the elections, party chairman Schnur had to confess having been an informer for the [[Ministry for State Security (East Germany)|Ministry for State Security]] and resigned. Although Alliance for Germany won the elections, Alliance member Democratic Awakening only collected 0.9% of votes, amounting to four seats in Volkskammer. Eppelmann became minister for disarmament and defense in the new government and new party chairman. On August 5, 1990 Democratic Awakening ceased to exist after merging into the East German CDU, which in turn on 3 October 1990 merged into its [[West German]] counterpart, the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU). 

From February 1990 [[Angela Merkel]] served as the party's spokeswoman.  After the mergers, Ms. Merkel was elected in the [[German federal election, 1990|post-unification election]] as a member of parliament for the CDU, and eventually became [[Chancellor of Germany]] in 2005.

The '''Evangelical Church in Germany''' ({{lang-de|Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland}}, abbreviated '''EKD''') is a [[federation]] of 22 [[Lutheran]], [[Prussian Union (Evangelical Christian Church)|Unified (Prussian Union)]] and [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] ([[Calvinist]]) [[Protestant]] [[Landeskirche|regional church bodies]] in Germany. The EKD is not a church in a theological understanding because of the [[Christian denomination|denominational]] differences. However, the member churches (''Gliedkirchen'') share full [[pulpit]] and [[altar]] [[Full communion|fellowship]]. The EKD has a membership of 24.832 million parishioners or 30.2% of the German population (status 31 December 2007).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ekd.de/statistik/mitglieder.html&lt;/ref&gt; Membership rates fell in 2008 to 24.515 million parishioners or 29.9% by the end of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekir.de/ekir/dokumente/Tab01.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Only one member church (the [[Evangelical Reformed Church]]) is not restricted to a certain territory. In a certain way, the other member churches resemble [[diocese]]s of the [[Anglican]] or [[Roman Catholic]] churches from an organisational point of view. However, the member churches of the EKD are independent with their own theological and formal organisation. Most member churches are led by a (state) [[bishop]]. One of the regional leaders is elected Council Chairman (''Ratsvorsitzender'') of the EKD by the Synod and Church Conference. All regional churches of the EKD are members of the [[Community of Protestant Churches in Europe]].

The German term {{lang|de|''evangelisch''}} here more accurately corresponds to the broad English term ''Protestant''&lt;ref&gt;Peter Terrell, ''Harper Collins German Unabridged Dictionary'', 4th ed., (New York: HarperCollins Publishers, Inc., 1999), 273 ''sub loco''.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than to the narrower ''[[evangelical]]'' (in German called {{lang|de|''evangelikal''}}), although the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]] and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of England]] use the term in the same way as the German church. Literally, {{lang|de|''evangelisch''}} means &quot;of the Gospel&quot;, denoting a [[Protestant Reformation]] emphasis on {{lang|la|''[[sola scriptura]]''}}, &quot;by scripture alone&quot;.

== History ==
Since the [[Peace of Augsburg]] 1555 until the end of [[World War I]] and the collapse of the [[German Empire]], some Protestant churches were [[state church]]es. Each {{lang|de|''[[Landeskirche]]''}}&lt;ref name=&quot;ekd.de&quot;/&gt; (regional church) was the official church of one of the [[states of Germany]] while the respective ruler was the church's formal head (e.g. the [[List of rulers of Prussia|King of Prussia]] headed the [[Evangelical Church of Prussia's older Provinces]] as supreme governor), similar to the [[British monarch]]'s role in the [[Church of England]].

This changed somewhat with growing religious freedom in the 19th century, especially in the three [[republicanism|republican]] states of [[Bremen]], [[Lübeck]] and [[Hamburg]]. The greatest change came after the [[German Revolution]] with the formation of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the abdication of the [[Prince#Prince as generic for ruler|princes]] of the German states. The system of state churches disappeared with the monarchies, and there was a desire for the Protestant churches to merge. In fact, a merger was permanently under discussion but never materialized due to strong regional self-confidence and traditions as well as the denominational fragmentation into [[Lutheran]], [[Reformed]] and United churches. During the revolution when the old church governments lost power, the People's Church Union ({{lang|de|''Volkskirchenbund''}}) was formed advocating unification without respect to theological tradition and increasing input from [[laymen]]. However, the People's Church Union quickly split along territorial lines after the churches' relationship with the government improved.&lt;ref name=statusofprotchurches&gt;D. Karl Bornhausen, &quot;The Present Status of the Protestant Churches in Germany,&quot; ''The Journal of Religion'', Vol. 3, No. 5 (Sep. 1923), 501-524.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was realized that one mainstream Protestant church for all of Germany was impossible and that any union would need a federal model. The churches met in [[Dresden]] in 1919 and created a plan for federation, and this plan was adopted in 1921 at [[Stuttgart]]. Then in 1922 the 28 territorially defined Protestant churches founded the [[German Evangelical Church Confederation]] ({{lang|de|''Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchenbund'' (DEKB)}}). At the time, the federation was the largest Protestant church union in Europe with around 40 million members.&lt;ref name=&quot;statusofprotchurches&quot;/&gt; Because it was a union of independent bodies, the Church Union's work was limited to foreign missions and relations with Protestant churches outside Germany, especially German Protestants in other countries.

In July 1933, the German Evangelical Church ({{lang|de|''Deutsche Evangelische Kirche''}}, DEK) was  formed under the influence of the [[German Christians]]. The [[National Socialist]]s had much influence over the decisions of the first National [[Synod]], via their unambiguous partisanship in successfully backing [[Ludwig Müller (theologian)|Ludwig Müller]] for the office of Reich bishop.  He did not manage, however, to prevail over the {{lang|de|''Landeskirchen''}} in the long term, and after the installation of [[Hanns Kerrl]] as minister for church matters in a Führer-directive of 16 July 1935 and the foundation of the [[Protestant Reich Church]], the DEK played more or less no further role.  

In 1948, freed from the German Christians' influence, the Lutheran, Reformed and United churches came together as the Evangelical Church in Germany at the Conference of Eisenach. In 1969, the churches in [[East Germany]] broke away from the EKD and formed the League of Evangelical Churches in the German Democratic Republic ({{lang-de|[[:de:Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR|Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR]]}}, BEK). In June 1991, following [[German reunification]], the BEK merged with the EKD.

While the members are no longer established churches, they are still called {{lang|de|''Landeskirchen''}}, and some have this term in their official names. A modern English translation, however, would be ''regional church''. Apart from some minor changes, the territories of the member churches today reflect Germany's political organisation in the year 1848, with state churches for states or provinces that no longer exist. For example between 1945 and 1948, the remaining six ecclesiastical provinces ({{lang|de|''Kirchenprovinzen''}}), each territorially comprising one of the [[Provinces of Prussia|Old Prussia]] provinces, within the [[Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union]] assumed independence as a consequence of the estrangement among them during the Nazi [[Kirchenkampf|struggle of the churches]]. This turned the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union into a mere umbrella, being itself a member of EKD but covering some regional church bodies, which were again themselves members of EKD.
[[Ordination of women]] is practised in all 22 member churches with many women having been ordained in recent years. There are also several female bishops. [[Margot Käßmann]], former Bishop of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover]] and Chairperson of the Council of the EKD from 2009 until February 2010, was the first woman to head the EKD.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsche Welle, 2009-10-28.

== Membership ==
Protestantism is the major religion in [[Northern Germany|Northern]], Eastern and [[Middle Germany]]: the [[Calvinism|Reformed]] branch in the extreme northwest and [[Lippe]], the [[Lutheran]] branch in the north and south, and the [[United and uniting churches|United]] branch in Middle and [[Western Germany]]. While the majority of Christians in [[Southern Germany]] are [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], some areas in [[Baden-Württemberg]] and [[Bavaria]] are predominantly Protestant, e.g. [[Middle Franconia]] and the [[Stuttgart (region)|government region of Stuttgart]]. The vast majority of German Protestants belong to a member church of the EKD. With 25,100,727 members in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ekd.de/english/4329-christians_in_germany.html &quot;Christians in Germany 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; around 30 percent of all Germans belong to a member church of the EKD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekd.de/statistik/mitglieder.html Statistical information &quot;Zahlen und Fakten zum kirchlichen Leben&quot; (EKD)]&lt;/ref&gt; Average church attendance is lower, however, with only around a million people attending a service on Sunday.&lt;ref name=services&gt;[http://www.ekd.de/english/4329-service_workship_holy_communion.html EKD: Services of Worship and Holy Communion 2006]. Accessed 16 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Protestant denominations that are not part of the Evangelical Church in Germany include the [[United Methodist Church]] ({{lang-de|Evangelisch-methodistische Kirche}}, EmK), the [[Independent Evangelical-Lutheran Church]], Baptists organised in the [[Union of Evangelical Free Church Congregations in Germany]] (''Bund evangelisch-freikirchlicher Gemeinden''), Pentecostals organised in the Union of Pentecostal Free-Churches (''Bund Freier Pfingstgemeinden''), the [[Union of the Free Evangelical Churches in Germany]] (''Bund Freier evangelischer Gemeinden in Deutschland''), [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and the [[New Apostolic Church]].

==Structure and practices==
The structure of the EKD is based on [[Federation|federal]] principles. Each local church is responsible for Christian life in its own area while each regional church has its own special characteristics and retains its independence. The Church carries out joint tasks with which its members have entrusted it. For the execution of these tasks, the Church has the following governing bodies, all organised and elected on democratic lines: 
=== Synode ===
The Synod is the legislature of the EKD. It has 126 members - 106 elected by ''Landeskirchen'' synods and 20 appointed by the Council. These 20 are appointed for their importance in the life of the Church and its agencies. Members serve six year terms and the synod meets annually.

The '''Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth''' ({{lang-de|Bundesministerium für Familie, Senioren, Frauen und Jugend}}) is a Ministry of [[Germany]]. It is headquartered in Berlin with a secondary seat in [[Bonn]]. The present minister is [[Kristina Schröder]] of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]].

== History ==
The original organization was first founded in 1953 as the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs (''Bundesministerium für Familienfragen''). In 1957, this was changed to the Ministry for Family and Youth Affairs (''Bundesministerium für Familien- und Jugendfragen'') and in 1963 to the Federal Ministry for Family and Youth (''Bundesministerium für Familie und Jugend''. In 1969 after the incorporation of the 1961-created Federal Ministry for Health (''Bundesministerium für Gesundheit''), it was changed to the Federal Ministry for Youth, Family and Health (''Bundesministerium für Jugend, Familie und Gesundheit''). In 1986, it was renamed to the Federal Ministry for Youth, Family, Women, and Health (''Bundesministerium für Jugend, Familie, Frauen und Gesundheit''). The area of health was removed in 1991 and transferred to the Federal Ministry for Health (now the [[Federal Ministry for Health and Social Security]], ''Bundesministerium für Gesundheit und Soziale Sicherung''). The remaining Ministry was divided into the Federal Ministry for Women and Youth (''Bundesministerium für Frauen und Jugend'') and the Federal Ministry for Family and Senior Citizens (''Bundesministerium für Familie und Senioren''). In 1994, these divided areas were combined into the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (''Bundesministerium für Familie, Senioren, Frauen und Jugend'').

The Ministry was highlighted in 2007 when the contents of one of the leaflets it distributed was claimed to encourage [[sexual massage]] between parents and their children.&lt;ref&gt;Franziska Badenschier, ''Der Spiegel'', 2007-07-31. [http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,497527,00.html &quot;Körper, Liebe, Doktorspiele&quot;: Von der Leyen stoppt umstrittene Aufklärungsbroschüre]. {{de-icon}} Retrieved 2010-11-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The booklets were removed from circulation when the matter became national news.

'''Frank-Walter Steinmeier''' {{IPA-de|ˈfʁaŋkˌvaltɐ ˈʃtaɪ̯nˌmaɪ̯.ɐ|}} (born 5 January 1956) is a [[Germany|German]] politician of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), and currently the leader of the opposition in the [[Bundestag]]. Steinmeier was a close aide of Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]], serving as Chief of Staff in the [[German Chancellery]] from 1999 to 2005. He subsequently served as [[Foreign Minister of Germany|Foreign Minister]] (2005–2009) and [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany|Vice Chancellor]] (2007–2009) in the [[grand coalition]] government of [[Angela Merkel]]. In 2008, he briefly served as acting chairman of his party.

==Early life==
Steinmeier was born in [[Detmold]]. Following his ''[[Abitur]]'', he served his military service from 1974 until 1976. He then studied law and political science at the [[University of Giessen|Justus-Liebig-Universität]] of [[Gießen]]. In 1982 he passed his first and 1986 his second state examination in law. He worked as scientific assistant to the professor of public law and political science at the Gießen university, until he obtained his doctorate of law in 1991.

Steinmeier is married and has one daughter.

On 24 August 2010, due to an illness of his wife, he successfully donated a kidney to her.

==Political career==
Steinmeier became an adviser in 1991 for law of communication media and media guidelines in the state Chancellery of [[Lower Saxony]] in [[Hanover]]. In 1993, he became director of the personal office for the then Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, [[Gerhard Schröder]]. In 1996, he became the Undersecretary of State and Director of the State Chancellery of Lower Saxony.

Steinmeier was appointed in November 1998 as Undersecretary of State in the Office of the Chancellor following Schröder's election victory. He replaced [[Bodo Hombach]] as the head of the [[German Chancellery|Office of the Chancellor]] in 1999. Because of his effective management beyond the spotlight of politics, he was nicknamed ''Die Graue Effizienz'' (The Grey Efficiency) -  a pun on ''Graue Eminenz'', the German for [[éminence grise]].

===Foreign minister===
On 22 November 2005, he became Foreign Minister of Germany in the Grand coalition cabinet formed by [[Angela Merkel]]. Steinmeier was the first SPD Foreign Minister since [[Willy Brandt]] (1966–1969).

Following [[Franz Müntefering]]'s departure from the cabinet on 21 November 2007, Steinmeier also filled the position of [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany|Vice-Chancellor]].&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Cremer and Brian Parkin, [http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&amp;sid=avKnSh84M5yQ&amp;refer=europe &quot;Muentefering, Vice-Chancellor Under Merkel, Quits&quot;], Bloomberg.com, November 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Steienmeier said he opposes European Commission proposals on unbundling the ownership of energy networks in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKL2056183720070120 German minister opposes EU utility unbundling idea] Reuters Jan 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian opposition activists celebrated when Steinmeier lost elections in 2009, signaling their discontent with Steinmeier. Oleg Orlov, head of the [[Memorial (society)|Memorial human rights group]], said that Steinmeier had prolonged Schröder's policies on Russia and that Germany's policies were &quot;extremely bad for civil society, democracy and the country as a whole&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mitrokhin&quot;&gt;[http://www.moscowtimes.ru/news/article/384405.html?bcsi_scan_3824BCB8D8969319=VysKnwvdmKseymeU5/v6mRAAAAArVj4G&amp;bcsi_scan_filename=384405.html German Vote Raises Hopes in Russia]. Moscow Times. 29 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Steinmeier refused to meet [[Dalai Lama]]. Instead, Steienmeier issued the statement &quot;it takes a lot of courage not to meet with the Dalai Lama these days&quot;, which the New York Times described as &quot;extraordinarily cynical&quot; and accused of Steinmeier of prioritizing money over human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/20/opinion/20iht-edgermany.4.13058304.html Steinmeier's bad example] New York Times May 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,553844,00.html German Minister Criticized for Planned Meeting with Dalai Lama]. Spiegel Online International. 17 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601100&amp;sid=aVLje9i2VD1A&amp;refer=germany Dalai Lama `Disappointed' Germany's Steinmeier Won't Meet Him] Bloomberg May 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Steinmeier served as acting chairman of the SPD from 7 September 2008 to 18 October 2008.

===2009 elections===
On 7 September 2008, following the resignation of SPD chairman [[Kurt Beck]], Steinmeier was chosen as the SPD candidate for chancellor for the [[German federal election, 2009|2009 federal elections]] and also designated as acting SPD Chairman, pending the return of Müntefering to that position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/08/content_9840654.htm &quot;German SPD party reshuffles leadership, with eye on election&quot;], Xinhua, September 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the SPD's decisive defeat in the elections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/6237210/Merkels-rival-concedes-defeat-in-German-election.html |title=Merkel's rival concedes defeat in German election |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=27 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steinmeier was elected as chairman of the SPD's parliamentary group in the [[Bundestag]], and as such leader of the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2009-09/spd-steinmeier-opposition |title=Steinmeier wird Oppositionsführer |newspaper=[[Die Zeit]] |date=27 September 2009 }}{{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a hospitalization for donating a kidney to his wife in August 2010, Steinmeier returned to his office in October 2010.

'''Franz Müntefering''' {{IPA-de|fʁants ˈmʏntəˌfeʁɪŋ||De-Franz Müntefering.ogg}} (born 16 January 1940) is a [[Germany|German]] politician and industrial manager. He was Chairman of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) from 18 October 2008 to 13 November 2009, a position he already held from 2004 to 2005. He was Federal Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, as well as [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany|Vice-Chancellor]], from 2005 to 2007.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Neheim]] (now part of [[Arnsberg]]) and joined the SPD in 1966. He was a member of the [[Bundestag]] from 1975 to 1992 and again since 1998; from 1995 to 1998 he was a member of the Landtag (state parliament) of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].

He was ''Bundesgeschäftsführer'' (executive director) of the national SPD from 1995 to 1998, and after holding briefly the post of Minister of Transportation and Construction in the first cabinet of Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]], he was the first to hold the new post of SPD General Secretary from 1999 to 2002, and thereafter became leader of the SPD fraction in the Bundestag. In February 2004 he was designated to succeed Schröder as party chairman in March 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Udo Kempf/ Hans-Georg Merz (eds.): ''Kanzler und Minister 1998-2005. Biographisches Lexikon der deutschen Bundesregierungen''. Wiesbaden: VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften, 2008, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2005, Müntefering criticized the market economy of Germany and proposed more state involvement to promote economic justice. In this speech, he described private equity firms as &quot;[[Locust (finance)|locust]]s&quot;. He subsequently published a &quot;locust list&quot; of companies, which he circulated within the SPD.&lt;ref&gt;http://service.spiegel.de/cache/international/0,1518,354733,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; This began a debate which has dominated the national news, being the subject of front-page articles and covered on the main television news broadcasts nearly every day. Müntefering's suggestions have been criticized by employers and many economists, but have met with popular support (up to 75% in some opinion polls).

On 31 October 2005, Müntefering's favoured candidate for Secretary General of the SPD, [[Kajo Wasserhövel]], was defeated by the left-wing candidate [[Andrea Nahles]] in a preliminary internal election. Müntefering subsequently announced his intention to resign as SPD Chairman, and was succeeded by [[Matthias Platzeck]] at the next party convention on 15 November 2005. Platzeck resigned from this position in April 2006, and his successor was [[Kurt Beck]].

Müntefering became Federal Minister of Labour and Social Affairs and Vice-Chancellor in the cabinet of [[Angela Merkel]] on 22 November 2005. After two years in those posts, Müntefering's spokesman said on 13 November 2007 that Müntefering would resign from them later in the month. The decision was said to be based on &quot;purely familial reasons&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2901628,00.html &quot;German Labor Minister Müntefering to Resign&quot;], ''Deutsche Welle'', November 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the day, Müntefering said that he would leave his positions in the government on 21 November attributing his decision to the illness of his wife, Ankepetra, who was suffering from cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Cremer and Brian Parkin, [http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&amp;sid=avKnSh84M5yQ&amp;refer=europe &quot;Muentefering, Vice-Chancellor Under Merkel, Quits&quot;], Bloomberg.com, 13 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon leaving office on 21 November 2007, he was replaced as Vice-Chancellor by [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] and as Minister of Labor by [[Olaf Scholz]], both of whom are also members of the SPD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/11/21/europe/EU-POL-Germany-Merkels-Two-Years.php &quot;Merkel defends record as Germany's tense governing coalition hits 2-year mark&quot;], Associated Press (''International Herald Tribune''), 21 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Müntefering's wife Ankepetra died on 31 July 2008. Following her death, Müntefering decided to return to active politics and was elected Chairman of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] on 18 October 2008.&lt;ref name=Picked&gt;Judy Dempsey, [http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/09/07/europe/germ.php &quot;German foreign minister picked to challenge Merkel&quot;], ''International Herald Tribune'', 7 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 September 2008, Kurt Beck resigned as SPD Chairman, and Müntefering succeeded Beck in that post.&lt;ref name=Picked/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/08/content_9840654.htm &quot;German SPD party reshuffles leadership, with eye on election&quot;], Xinhua, 7 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the SPD's defeat in the [[German federal election, 2009|federal election of 2009]], Müntefering resigned from the position of party chairman of the Social Democratic Party.

'''Gerhard Fritz Kurt Schröder''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡɛɐ̯haɐ̯t fʁɪts kʊʁt ˈʃʁøːdɐ||De-Gerhard Fritz Kurt Schröder.ogg}}; born 7 April 1944) is a German [[politics|politician]], and was [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Chancellor of Germany]] from 1998 to 2005. A member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]), he led a [[coalition government]] of the SPD and the [[Alliance 90/The Greens|Greens]]. Before becoming a full-time politician, he was a lawyer, and before becoming Chancellor he served as [[Premier of Lower Saxony]] (1990–1998). Following the [[German federal elections, 2005|2005 federal election]], which his party lost, after three weeks of negotiations he stood down as Chancellor in favour of [[Angela Merkel]] of the rival [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]]. He is currently the chairman of the board of [[Nord Stream AG]], after having been hired as a global manager by investment bank [[N M Rothschild &amp; Sons|Rothschild]].

== Early career ==
Schröder was born in Mossenberg, today an outlying centre of [[Blomberg (town)|Blomberg]], in what is now [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. His father, Fritz Schröder, a lance corporal in the [[Wehrmacht]], was killed in action in [[World War II]] in [[Romania]] on 4 October 1944, a few months after Gerhard's birth. His mother Erika worked as an agricultural laborer so that she could support herself and her two sons.

Schröder completed an [[apprenticeship]] in retail sales in a [[Lemgo]] hardware shop from 1958 to 1961 and subsequently worked in a [[Lage]] retail shop and after that as an unskilled construction worker and a sales clerk in [[Göttingen]] whilst studying at night school so as to gain a high school diploma. He did not have to do military service because his father had died in the war.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,128137,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Schröder secured entrance to a university, passing the [[Abitur]] exam at Westfalen-Kolleg, [[Bielefeld]]. From 1966 to 1971 he studied law at the [[University of Göttingen]]. From 1972 onwards, Schröder served as an assistant at the university. In 1976, he passed his second law examination, and he subsequently worked as a lawyer until 1990.

Among his more controversial cases, Schröder helped founding member of the [[Red Army Faction|Baader-Meinhof]] terrorist group [[Horst Mahler]] secure an early release from prison and the permission to practice law again in Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;schroeder&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jf-archiv.de/archiv98/208aa7.htm|title=Gerhard-Schröder-Biographie: Horst Mahler stellt das Buch eines Konservativen vor Hoffnung keimt im Verborgenen|accessdate=7 November 2007|work=Junge Freiheit|first=Thorsten|last=Thaler|date=8 May 1998|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schröder joined the Social Democratic Party in 1963. In 1978 he became the federal [[chairman]] of the [[Young Socialists in the SPD|Young Socialists]], the youth organisation of the SPD. He spoke for the dissident [[Rudolf Bahro]], as did President [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Wolf Biermann]]. In 1982 he wrote an article on the idea of a red/green coalition for a book at Olle &amp; Wolter, Berlin, which later appeared in &quot;[[Die Zeit]]&quot;. SPD and SI Chairman, Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]], who reviewed Olle &amp; Wolter at that time, had just asked for more books on the subject. In 1980 Gerhard Schröder was elected to the German [[Bundestag]], and wore a sweater to parliament instead of the traditional suit. He became chairman of the SPD [[Hanover]] district. In 1985, Schröder met the [[East Germany|GDR]] leader [[Erich Honecker]] during a visit to [[East Berlin]].

In 1986, Schröder was elected to the parliament of [[Lower Saxony]] and became leader of the SPD group. After the SPD won the state elections in June 1990, he became [[Premier of Lower Saxony]] as head of an SPD-[[Alliance '90/The Greens|Greens]] coalition; in this position, he also won the 1994 and 1998 state elections.

== In federal politics ==
Following his election as [[Minister-President]] in 1990, Schröder became a member of the board of the federal SPD. In 1997 and 1998 he served as [[President of the German Bundesrat|President]] of the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]], but he left office on 27 October, three days before his term expired, when he became Chancellor as head of an SPD-Green coalition. At the 22 September [[German federal election, 2002|2002 general elections]], he secured another four-year term, with a narrow nine-seat majority (down from 21).

After the resignation of [[Oskar Lafontaine]] as SPD Chairman in March, 1999, in protest at Schröder's adoption of a number of what Lafontaine considered &quot;[[neo-liberal]]&quot; policies, Schröder took over his rival's office as well. In February, 2004, he resigned as chairman of the SPD. [[Franz Müntefering]] succeeded him as chairman.

On 22 May 2005, after the SPD lost to the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democrats]] (CDU) in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Gerhard Schröder announced he would call federal elections &quot;as soon as possible&quot;. A [[motion of confidence]] was subsequently defeated in the [[Bundestag]] on 1 July 2005 by 151 to 296 (with 148 abstaining), after Schröder urged members not to vote for his government in order to trigger new elections.

[[Image:Gerhardschroeder.jpg|thumb|left|290px|&quot;SPD - Trust in Germany&quot;: Schröder in [[Esslingen am Neckar|Esslingen]].]]
The 2005 [[German federal elections, 2005|German federal elections]] were held on 18 September. After the elections, neither Schröder's SPD-Green coalition nor the alliance between CDU/CSU and the FDP led by [[Angela Merkel]] achieved a majority in parliament, but the CDU/CSU had a stronger popular electoral lead by one percentage point. Since the SPD had been trailing the CDU by more than 15 points only weeks before the election, this outcome was a surprise and was mainly attributed to Schröder's charisma and prowess as a campaigner;{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} polls consistently showed that he was much more popular with the German people than Merkel.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} On election night, both Schröder and Merkel claimed victory and chancellorship, but after initially ruling out a [[grand coalition]] with Merkel, Schröder and [[Müntefering]] entered negotiations with her and the CSU's [[Edmund Stoiber]]. On 10 October, it was announced that the parties had agreed to form a grand coalition. Schröder agreed to cede the chancellorship to Merkel, but the SPD would hold the majority of government posts and retain considerable control of government policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4325600.stm|title=Merkel named as German chancellor|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=29 April 2007|date=10 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merkel was elected chancellor on 22 November.

On 11 October, Schröder announced that he would not take a post in the new Cabinet and, in November, he confirmed that he would leave politics as soon as Merkel took office. On 23 November 2005, he resigned his [[Bundestag]] seat. Subsequently, he joined [[Ringier AG]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ringier.ch/index.cfm?pub=2 Ringier]&lt;/ref&gt; the publisher of some of the leading newspapers and magazines in Switzerland and Europe, as a [[Zurich]]-based political consultant and lobbyist.

On 14 November, at the SPD conference in [[Karlsruhe]], Schröder urged members of the SPD to support the proposed coalition, saying it &quot;carries unmistakably, perhaps primarily, the imprint of the Social Democrats&quot;. Many SPD members had previously indicated that they supported the coalition, which would have continued the policies of Schröder's government, but had objected to [[Angela Merkel]] replacing him as Chancellor. The conference voted overwhelmingly to approve the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4434812.stm|title=German parties back new coalition|work=BBC News|accessdate=29 April 2007|date=14 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chancellorship ==
===Domestic policies===
In its first term, Schröder's government decided to phase out [[nuclear power]], fund [[renewable energy|renewable energies]], institute [[civil unions in Germany|civil unions]] which enabled same-sex partners to enter into a civil union, and liberalize [[naturalization]] law. Most voters associated Schröder with the [[Agenda 2010]] reform program, which included cuts in the [[social welfare]] system ([[national health insurance]], [[unemployment insurance|unemployment payments]], [[pension]]s), lowered taxes, and reformed regulations on employment and payment.

After the 2002 election, the SPD steadily lost support in opinion polls. Many increasingly perceived Schröder's [[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]] program to be a dismantling of the German [[welfare state]]. Moreover, Germany's high unemployment rate remained a serious problem for the government. Schröder's tax policies were also unpopular; when the satirical radio show [[The Gerd Show]] released ''Der Steuersong'', featuring Schröder's voice (by impressionist [[Elmar Brandt]]) lampooning Germany's [[indirect taxation]] with the lyrics ''&quot;Dog tax, tobacco tax, emissions and environmental tax, did you really think more weren't coming?&quot;'', it became Germany's 2002 Christmas No. 1 chart hit and sold over a million copies.

The fact that Schröder served on the [[Volkswagen]] board (a position that came with his position as [[Minister-president#Germany|minister-president]] of Lower Saxony) and tended to prefer pro-car policies led to him being nicknamed the &quot;Auto-Kanzler&quot; (car chancellor).

===Foreign policy===
[[File:Vladimir Putin with Gerhard Schroeder-1.jpg|thumb|Schröder with then [[President of Russia]] [[Vladimir Putin]] in Moscow on 9 May 2005]]
[[File:Quadriga-verleihung-rr-20.jpg|thumb|upright|Gerhard Schröder attending [[Quadriga (award)|Quadriga]] awards ceremony with [[Boris Tadić]]]]
Schröder sent forces to [[Kosovo]] and to [[Afghanistan]] as part of [[NATO]] operations. Until Schröder's Chancellorship, German troops had not taken part in combat actions since [[World War II]]. With Germany having a long experience with [[terrorism]] itself, Schröder declared solidarity with the United States after the [[9/11|September 11 terrorist attacks]]. When Schröder left office Germany had 2,000 troops in Afghanistan, the largest contingent from any nation other than the United States, Britain, France, Canada and after 2 years Afghanistan.

Along with French President [[Jacques Chirac]] and many other world leaders, Schröder spoke out strongly against the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and refused any military assistance in that enterprise. Schröder's stance caused political friction between the U.S. and Germany, in particular because he used this topic for his 2002 election campaign. Schröder's stance set the stage for alleged anti-American statements by members of the SPD. The parliamentary leader of the SPD, [[Ludwig Stiegler]], compared U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] to [[Julius Caesar]] while Schröder's Minister of Justice, [[Herta Däubler-Gmelin]], likened Bush's foreign policy to that of [[Adolf Hitler]]. Schröder's critics accused him of enhancing, and campaigning on, anti-American sentiments in Germany. Since his 2002 re-election, Schröder and Bush rarely met and their animosity was seen as a widening political gap between the U.S. and Europe. Bush stated in his memoirs that Schröder initially promised to support the Iraq war but changed his mind with the upcoming German elections and public opinion strongly against the invasion, to which Schröder responded saying that Bush was “not telling the truth”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.macleans.ca/2010/11/24/schroder-bush-dust-up/]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 1 August 2004, the 60th anniversary of the 1944 [[Warsaw Uprising]], he apologised to Poland for &quot;the immeasurable suffering&quot; of its people during the conflict. He was the first German chancellor to be invited to an anniversary of the uprising.

In addition to a friendly relationship with Jacques Chirac, Schröder cultivated close ties with Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]], in an attempt to strengthen the &quot;strategic partnership&quot; between Berlin and Moscow, including the opening of a gas pipeline from ''Russian Andrew Marino-Pipelines'' over the Baltic Sea exclusively between Russia and Germany (see [[#Gazprom|&quot;Gazprom controversy&quot;]] below). Schröder was criticized in the media, and subsequently by Angela Merkel, for calling Putin a &quot;flawless democrat&quot; on 22 November 2004, only days before Putin prematurely congratulated [[Viktor Yanukovich]] during the [[Orange Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://service.spiegel.de/cache/international/0,1518,330461,00.html|title=Gerhard Schroeder's Dangerous Liaison|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=29 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Only a few days after his chancellorship, Schröder joined the board of directors of the joint venture. Thus bringing about new speculations about his prior objectivity. In his memoirs ''Decisions: My Life in Politics'', Schröder still defends his friend and political ally, and states that &quot;it would be wrong to place excessive demands on Russia when it comes to the rate of domestic political reform and democratic development, or to judge it solely on the basis of the Chechnya conflict.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,444944,00.html|title=It Would Be Wrong to Place Excessive Demands|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=29 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schröder has criticised some European countries' swift decision to recognise [[Kosovo]] as an independent state after it [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|declared independence]] in February 2008. He believes the decision was taken under heavy pressure from the U.S. government and has caused more problems, including the weakening of the so-called pro-EU forces in Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=05&amp;dd=05&amp;nav_id=49989|title=Schroeder: Kosovo recognition &quot;against Europe’s interests&quot;|work=B92|date=5 May 2008|accessdate=5 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, Schröder laid the blame for the [[2008 South Ossetia war]] squarely on [[Mikhail Saakashvili]] and &quot;the West&quot;, hinting at American foreknowledge and refusing to criticize any aspect of Russian policy which had thus far come to light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,572686-2,00.html|title=Serious Mistakes by the West|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=21 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
[[File:Gerhard and Doris Schroeder.jpg|thumb|upright|Gerhard and [[Doris Schröder-Köpf|Doris Schröder]] at the 300th anniversary of [[Saint Petersburg]] celebrations on 30 May 2003]]
Schröder has been married four times:
* Eva Schubach (married 1968, divorced 1972);
* Anne Taschenmacher (married 1972, divorced 1984);
* Hiltrud Hampel (&quot;Hillu&quot;; married 1984, divorced 1997);
* [[Doris Köpf]] (married 1997).

Schröder's four marriages have earned him the nickname &quot;Audi Man&quot;, a reference to the four-ring symbol of [[Audi]] motorcars. Another nickname is &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/germany/article/0,2763,792629,00.html|title=The Audi man|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=29 April 2007|first=Kate|last=Connolly|date=15 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/09/19/wger219.xml|title=The 'Audi Man' is not quite ready to concede defeat|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=29 April 2007|first=Charles|last=Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doris Köpf has a daughter, Klara, born in 1991, from a previous relationship with a television journalist. She lives with the couple. In July 2004, Schröder and Köpf adopted a child named [[Viktoria Schröder|Viktoria]] from [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] in Russia. In 2006, they adopted another child from St. Petersburg, Gregor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.welt.de/politik/article146254/Schroeder_nimmt_noch_ein_Kind_auf.html|title=Schröder nimmt noch ein Kind auf|work=[[Die Welt]]|date=17 August 2006|accessdate=29 April 2007|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When not in Berlin, Schröder lives in [[Hanover]].

Schröder identifies himself as a member of the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]], but does not appear to be religious. He did not add the optional phrase ''So wahr mir Gott helfe'' (&quot;so help me God&quot;) when sworn in as chancellor for his first term in 1998 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/10/27/world/main21100.shtml|title=Schroeder Takes Germany's Helm Social Democrat Sworn In As Chancellor Tuesday|work=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=8 January 2008|date=27 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accused the deeply religious former US President [[George W Bush]] of 'hearing voices.' 

Schröder's plans after leaving office as Chancellor and resigning his Bundestag seat include resuming his law practice in Berlin and writing a book. He will also be retained by the Swiss publisher Ringier AG as a consultant. He rents an apartment in Berlin while retaining his primary residence in Hanover. As a former Chancellor, he is entitled to a permanent office, also situated in Berlin. He has also spent time improving his English language skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/4509818.stm|title=Schroeder's Welsh English course|work=BBC News|accessdate=29 April 2007|date=8 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism and controversies ==
===Gazprom===
As Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder was a strong advocate of the [[Nord Stream]] pipeline project, which aims to supply Russian gas directly to Germany, thereby bypassing transit countries. The agreement to build the pipeline was signed two weeks before the [[German federal election, 2005|German parliamentary election]]. On 24 October 2005, just a few weeks before Schröder stepped down as Chancellor, the German government guaranteed to cover 1 billion euros of the Nord Stream project cost, should [[Gazprom]] default on a loan. However, this guarantee had never been used.&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite web|work=Financial Times|first1=Tobias|last1=Buck|first2=Bertrand|last2=Benoit|title=EU to probe German gas pipeline guarantee|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/4b16eef6-deb2-11da-acee-0000779e2340.html|date=8 May 2006|accessdate=26 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after stepping down as chancellor, Schröder accepted Gazprom's nomination for the post of the head of the shareholders' committee of [[Nord Stream AG]], raising questions about a potential conflict of interest. German opposition parties expressed concern over the issue, as did the governments of countries over whose territory gas is currently pumped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4515914.stm|title=Schroeder attacked over gas post|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=29 April 2007|date=10 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an editorial entitled ''Gerhard Schroeder's Sellout'', the American newspaper ''[[The Washington Post]]'' also expressed sharp criticism, reflecting widening international ramifications of Schröder's new post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/12/AR2005121201060.html|title=Gerhard Schroeder's Sellout|work=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=29 April 2007|date=13 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Democrat [[Tom Lantos]], chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs]], likened Schröder to a &quot;political prostitute&quot; for his recent behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-06-13-2870151492_x.htm|title=Lantos Raps Former European Leaders|agency=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=13 June 2007|date=13 June 2007|first=Harry|last=Dunphy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, the ''Wall Street Journal'' reported that Schröder would join the board of the oil company [[TNK-BP]], a joint venture between oil major [[BP]] and Russian partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123203091405585667.html WSJ, Schröder to join TNK-BP board, 19 January 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defamation lawsuit===
In April 2002, Schröder sued the DDP press agency for publishing an opinion of [[public relations]] consultant Sabine Schwind saying that he &quot;would be more credible if he didn't dye his gray hair&quot;. The court decided to ban the media from suggesting that he colours his hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A36035-2002May17&amp;notFound=true|title=Court: Stay Out of Schroeder's Hair|work=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=29 April 2007|first=Peter|last=Finn|date=18 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Unnecessary given the sentence afterward?: The case was taken seriously by politicians.--&gt; The Chancellor's spokesman said: &quot;This is not a frivolous action taken over whether he does or doesn't dye his hair, but is a serious issue regarding his word.&quot; The agency's lawyer said that they could not accept a verdict which &quot;does not coincide with freedom of the press.&quot;

===Dispute over Estonian war memorial===
During a heated dispute between Russia and Estonia in May 2007 over [[Bronze Night|the removal of a Soviet-era war memorial]] from the centre of the Estonian capital [[Tallinn]] to a military cemetery, Schröder defended the Kremlin's reaction. He remarked that Estonia had contradicted &quot;every form of civilised behaviour&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/daily/columns/europeview/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9142057&amp;fsrc=nwl|title=How to fight back|work=[[The Economist]]|accessdate=10 May 2007|date=10 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the Estonian government cancelled a planned visit by Schröder in his function as chairman of Nord Stream AG.

'''Germany''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-uk-Germany.ogg|ˈ|dʒ|ɜr|m|ə|n|i}}), officially the '''Federal Republic of Germany''' ({{lang-de|Bundesrepublik Deutschland}}, {{IPA-de|ˈbʊndəsʁepuˌbliːk ˈdɔʏtʃlant|pron|De-Bundesrepublik_Deutschland.ogg}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Mangold, Max |title=Duden, Aussprachewörterbuch |edition=6th |year=1995 |publisher=Dudenverlag  |language=German |isbn= 9783411209163 |pages=271, 53f}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[federation|federal]] [[parliamentary republic]] in [[Europe]]. The country consists of [[Lands of Germany|16 states]] while the [[capital city|capital]] and [[List of cities in Germany by population|largest city]] is [[Berlin]]. Germany covers an area of 357,021&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With 81.8&amp;nbsp;million inhabitants, it is the most populous member state and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|largest economy]] in the [[European Union]]. It is one of the major political powers of the European continent and a technological leader in many fields.

A region named [[Germania]], inhabited by several [[Germanic people]]s, was [[Germania (book)|documented]] before AD&amp;nbsp;100. During the [[Migration Age]], the [[Germanic tribes]] expanded southward, and established successor kingdoms throughout much of [[Europe]]. Beginning in the 10th century, [[Germans|German]] territories formed a central part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;The Latin name ''Sacrum Imperium'' (Holy Empire) is documented as far back as 1157. The Latin name ''Sacrum Romanum Imperium'' (Holy Roman Empire) was first documented in 1254. The full name &quot;Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation&quot; (''Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation'') dates back to the 15th century.&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book | last = Zippelius| first = Reinhold| title = Kleine deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte: vom frühen Mittelalter bis zur Gegenwart| trans_title   = Brief German Constitutional History: from the Early Middle Ages to the Present| edition   = 7| origyear  = 1994| year  = 2006| publisher =Beck| location  = Munich| language  = German| isbn  = 9783406476389| page = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the [[Protestant Reformation]] while southern and western parts remained dominated by [[Roman Catholic]] denominations, with the two factions clashing in the [[Thirty Years' War]], marking the beginning of the Catholic–[[Protestant]] divide that has characterized German society ever since.&lt;ref name=&quot;georgetown1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/germany |title=Germany |work= |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |date= |accessdate=2011-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupied during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the rise of [[Pan-Germanism]] inside the [[German Confederation]] resulted in the unification of most of the German states into the [[unification of Germany|German Empire]] in 1871 which was [[Prussia]]n dominated. After the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]] and the subsequent military surrender in [[World War I]], the Empire was replaced by the [[Weimar Republic]] in 1918, and partitioned in the [[Versailles Treaty]]. Amidst the [[Great Depression]], the [[Third Reich]] was proclaimed in 1933. The latter period was marked by [[Fascism]] and the [[Second World War]]. After 1945, Germany was divided by [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|allied occupation]], and evolved into two states, [[East Germany]] and [[West Germany]]. In 1990 Germany was [[German reunification|reunified]].

Germany was a founding member of the [[European Communities|European Community]] in 1957, which became the EU in 1993. It is part of the [[Schengen Area]] and since 1999 a member of the [[eurozone]]. Germany is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[NATO]], the [[G8]], the [[G-20 major economies|G20]], the [[OECD]] and the [[Council of Europe]], and took a non-permanent seat on the [[UN Security Council]] for the 2011–2012 term.

It has the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|fourth largest economy]] by nominal [[GDP]] and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|fifth largest]] by [[purchasing power parity]]. It is the [[List of countries by exports|second largest exporter]] and [[List of countries by imports|third largest importer]] of goods. The country has developed a [[List of countries by Human Development Index|very high standard of living]] and a comprehensive system of [[social security]]. Germany has been the home of many influential [[Science and technology in Germany|scientists and inventors]], and is known for its [[Culture of Germany|cultural]] and [[politics of Germany|political]] [[history of Germany|history]].

==Etymology==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
{{Main|Names of Germany}}
The English word ''Germany'' derives from the Latin [[Germania]], which came into use after [[Julius Caesar]] adopted it for the peoples east of the [[Rhine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Schulze |first=Hagen |authorlink=Hagen Schulze |title=Germany: A New History |publisher= Harvard University Press |page=4 |year=1998 |isbn= 0-674-80688-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other languages it has [[Names of Germany|various names]].

The [[German language|German]] term ''Deutschland'' (originally ''diutisciu land'', &quot;the German lands&quot;) is derived from [[wikt:deutsch#German|''deutsch'']], descended from [[Old High German]] ''diutisc'' &quot;popular&quot; (i. e., belonging to the ''diot'' or ''diota'' &quot;people&quot;; originally used to distinguish the [[Vernacular|language of the common people]] from Latin and its Romance descendants). This in turn descends from [[Proto-Germanic]] [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/þiudiskaz|*''þiudiskaz'']] &quot;popular&quot; (see also the Latinised form [[Theodiscus]]), derived from [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/þeudō|*''þeudō'']], descended from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/tewtéh₂|*''tewtéh₂-'']] &quot;people&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lloyd|first=Albert L.|title=Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Althochdeutschen, Band II|year=1998|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht|location=Göttingen|isbn=3-525-20768-9|pages=699–704|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iKfYGNwwNVIC&amp;pg=PA523|coauthors=Lühr, Rosemarie; Springer, Otto|language=German}} (for ''diutisc'')

{{Main|History of Germany}}

===Germanic tribes and Frankish Empire===
{{Main|Germania|Migration Period}}
[[File:Imperium Romanum Germania.png|thumb|250px|left|Map of the [[Germania]] and the [[Roman Empire]]]]
The [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] are [[ethnogenesis|thought to date from]] the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] or the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]]. From southern Scandinavia and north Germany, they expanded south, east and west from the 1st century&amp;nbsp;BC, coming into contact with the [[Celt]]ic tribes of [[Gaul]] as well as [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], [[Balts|Baltic]], and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes in [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first =Jill N. |last = Claster |title =Medieval Experience: 300–1400 |publisher =New York University Press |year =1982 |page =35 |isbn=0-8147-1381-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Augustus]], the Roman General [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]] began to invade Germania (an area extending roughly from the [[Rhine]] to the [[Ural Mountains]]). In AD&amp;nbsp;9, three [[Roman legion]]s led by Varus were [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest|defeated]] by the [[Cheruscan]] leader [[Arminius]]. By AD&amp;nbsp;100, when [[Tacitus]] wrote ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the [[Limes Germanicus]]), occupying most of the area of modern Germany; Austria, southern [[Bavaria]] and the western [[Rhineland]], however, were Roman provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;9-13&quot;&gt;Fulbrook 1991, pp. 9–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 3rd century a number of large West Germanic tribes emerged: [[Alamanni]], [[Franks]], [[Chatti]], [[Saxons]], [[Frisii]], [[Sicambri]], and [[Thuringii]]. Around 260, the Germanic peoples broke into Roman-controlled lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |series= The Cambridge Ancient History |title =The crisis of empire, A.D. 193–337 |volume =12 |page =442 |isbn=0-521-30199-8 |first =Alan K. |last =Bowman |first2 =Peter |last2 =Garnsey |first3 =Averil |last3 =Cameron |publisher =Cambridge University Press |year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the invasion of the [[Huns]] in 375, and with the decline of Rome from 395, Germanic tribes moved further south-west. Simultaneously several large tribes formed in what is now Germany and displaced the smaller Germanic tribes. Large areas (known since the [[Merovingian]] period as [[Austrasia]]) were occupied by the [[Frankish Empire|Franks]], and Northern Germany was ruled by the Saxons and Slavs.&lt;ref name=&quot;9-13&quot;/&gt;

===Holy Roman Empire===
{{Main|Holy Roman Empire}}
[[File:Martin Luther by Lucas Cranach der Ältere.jpeg|thumb|140px|upright|left|[[Martin Luther]] initiated the [[Protestant Reformation]].]]

On 25 December 800, [[Charlemagne]] founded the [[Carolingian Empire]], which was [[Treaty of Verdun|divided in 843]].&lt;ref name=&quot;f11&quot;&gt;Fulbrook 1991, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The Holy Roman Empire resulted from the [[East Francia|eastern portion]] of this division. Its territory stretched from the [[Eider River]] in the north to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast in the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;f11&quot;/&gt; Under the reign of the [[Ottonian]] emperors (919–1024), several major [[Stem duchy|duchies]] were consolidated, and the German king was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] of these regions in 962. The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] under the reign of the [[Salian]] emperors (1024–1125), although the emperors lost power through the [[Investiture Controversy]].

Under the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors (1138–1254), the German princes increased their influence further south and east into territories inhabited by [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], preceding [[History of German settlement in Eastern Europe|German settlement]] in these areas and further east ''([[Ostsiedlung]])''. Northern German towns grew prosperous as members of the [[Hanseatic League]].&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook 1991, pp. 13–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with the [[Great Famine of 1315–1317|Great Famine]] in 1315, then the [[Black Death]] of 1348–50, the population of Germany plummeted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url =http://www.vlib.us/medieval/lectures/black_death.html |title =The Great Famine (1315–1317) and the Black Death (1346–1351) |first =Lynn Harry |last =Nelson |publisher =University of Kansas |accessdate =19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The edict of the [[Golden Bull of 1356|Golden Bull]] in 1356 provided the basic constitution of the empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven [[prince-elector]]s who ruled some of the most powerful principalities and archbishoprics.&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook 1991, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Luther]] publicised his [[The 95 Theses|95 Theses]] in 1517, challenging the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and initiating the [[Protestant Reformation]]. A separate [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church became the official religion in many German states after 1530. Religious conflict led to the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648), which devastated German lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Philpott|first=Daniel|title=The Religious Roots of Modern International Relations|journal=World Politics|date=January 2000|volume=52|issue=2|pages=206–245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population of the German states was reduced by about 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title =The savage wars of peace: England, Japan and the Malthusian trap |first =Alan |last= Macfarlane |publisher =Blackwell |year = 1997 |page=51 | isbn= 9780631181170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648) ended religious warfare among the German states, but the empire was ''de facto'' divided into numerous independent principalities. From 1740 onwards, [[German dualism|dualism]] between the Austrian [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] dominated German history. In 1806, the ''Imperium'' was overrun and dissolved as a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook 1991, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

===German Confederation and Empire===
{{Main|German Confederation|German Empire|Pan-Germanism}}
Following the fall of [[Napoleon I of France]], the [[Congress of Vienna]] convened in 1814 and founded the German Confederation (Deutscher Bund), a loose league of [[List of German Confederation member states|39 sovereign states]]. Disagreement with [[European Restoration|restoration]] politics partly led to the rise of [[Liberalism in Germany|liberal]] movements, followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]]. The ''[[Zollverein]]'', a tariff union, furthered economic unity in the German states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henderson |first=W. O. |title=The Zollverein |journal=History |date=January 1934 |volume=19 |issue=73 |pages=1–19 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-229X.1934.tb01791.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[nationalism|National]] and liberal ideals of the [[French Revolution]] gained increasing support among many, especially young, Germans. In the light of a [[Revolutions of 1848|series of revolutionary movements in Europe]], which established a republic [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|in France]], intellectuals and commoners started the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]]. King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] was offered the title of Emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, leading to a temporary setback for the movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;state&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Wernerprokla.jpg|thumb|Foundation of the German Empire in [[Versailles]], 1871. [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] is at the centre in a white uniform.]]
Conflict between King [[William I, German Emperor|William I]] of Prussia and the increasingly liberal parliament erupted over military reforms in 1862, and the king appointed [[Otto von Bismarck]] the new [[Prime Minister of Prussia]]. Bismarck successfully waged [[Second War of Schleswig|war on Denmark]] in 1864. Prussian victory in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866 enabled him to create the [[North German Federation]] (Norddeutscher Bund) and to exclude [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], formerly the leading German state, from the federation's affairs. After the French defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the German Empire was proclaimed 1871 in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], uniting all scattered parts of Germany except Austria ({{lang|de|[[Kleindeutsche Lösung|''Kleindeutschland'']]}}, or &quot;Lesser Germany&quot;). With almost two thirds of its territory and population, Prussia was the dominating constituent of the new state; the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] King of Prussia ruled as its concurrent Emperor, and Berlin became its capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;state&quot;/&gt; In the {{lang|de|''[[Gründerzeit]]''}} period following the [[unification of Germany]], Bismarck's foreign policy as [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] of Germany under Emperor William I secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances, isolating [[French Third Republic|France]] by diplomatic means, and avoiding war. Under [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], however, Germany, like other European powers, took an [[New Imperialism|imperialistic]] course leading to friction with neighbouring countries. As a result of the [[Berlin Conference]] in 1884 Germany claimed several [[List of former German colonies|colonies]] including [[German East Africa]], [[German South-West Africa]], [[Togoland|Togo]], and [[Cameroon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=100 maps |year=2005 |publisher=Sterling Publishing |isbn=9781402728853 |editor=Black, John |page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most alliances in which Germany had previously been involved were not renewed, and new alliances excluded the country.&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook 1991, pp. 135, 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Austria's crown prince]] on 28 June 1914 triggered [[World War I]]. Germany, as part of the [[Central Powers]], suffered defeat against the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in [[World War I casualties|one of the bloodiest]] conflicts of all time. An estimated two million German soldiers died in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,530319,00.html |title = Last German World War I Veteran Believed to Have Died |work =Spiegel Online |date =22 January 2008 |first =David |last =Crossland |accessdate=25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|German Revolution]] broke out in November 1918, and Emperor Wilhelm II and all German ruling princes [[abdication|abdicated]]. An [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|armistice]] ended the war on 11 November, and Germany was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in June 1919. The treaty was perceived in Germany as a humiliating continuation of the war, and is often cited as an influence in the rise of [[Nazism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first =Stephen J. |last =Lee |title =Europe, 1890–1945 |publisher =Routledge |year =2003 |page =131 |isbn = 9780415254557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the German Revolution in November 1918, Germany was declared a [[republic]]. However, the struggle for power continued, with radical-left communists [[Bavarian Socialist Republic|seizing power in Bavaria]]. The revolution came to an end on 11 August 1919, when the democratic [[Weimar Constitution]] was signed by [[President of Germany|President]] [[Friedrich Ebert]].&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook 1991, pp. 156–160.&lt;/ref&gt; Suffering from the [[Great Depression]] of 1929, the harsh peace conditions dictated by the Treaty of Versailles, and a long succession of unstable governments, Germans increasingly lacked identification with the government. This was exacerbated by a widespread right-wing {{lang|de|''[[Dolchstoßlegende]]''}}, or stab-in-the-back myth, which argued that Germany had lost World War I because of those who wanted to overthrow the government. The Weimar government was accused of betraying Germany by signing the Versailles Treaty. By 1932, the [[Communist Party of Germany|German Communist Party]] and the [[Nazi Party]] controlled the majority of parliament, fuelled by discontent with the Weimar government. After a series of unsuccessful cabinets, President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] appointed [[Adolf Hitler]] as [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor of Germany]] on 30 January 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook 1991, pp. 155–158, 172–177.&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February 1933 the [[Reichstag fire|Reichstag]] building went up in flames, and a consequent [[Reichstag Fire Decree|emergency decree]] abrogated basic citizens' rights.

In 1935, Germany reacquired control of the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]] and in 1936 military control of the [[Rhineland]], both of which had been lost in the Treaty of Versailles.&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook 1991, pp. 188–189.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, [[Austria]] was [[Anschluss|annexed]], and in 1939, [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]] was brought under German control. The [[invasion of Poland]] was prepared through the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop pact]] and [[Operation Himmler]]. On 1 September 1939 the German [[Wehrmacht]] launched a [[blitzkrieg]] on [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], which was swiftly occupied by Germany and by the Soviet [[Red Army]]. The UK and France declared war on Germany, marking the beginning of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fulbrook 190&quot;&gt;Fulbrook 1991, pp. 190–195.&lt;/ref&gt; As the war progressed, Germany and its [[Axis powers|allies]] quickly gained control of most of [[Occupied Europe|continental Europe]] and [[North Africa]], though plans to [[Battle of Britain|force the United Kingdom]] to an armistice or surrender failed. On 22 June 1941, Germany broke the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact and [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]]. [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]'s [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] led Germany to declare war on the United States. The [[Battle of Stalingrad]] forced the German army to retreat on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern front]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fulbrook 190&quot;/&gt; In September 1943, Germany's ally Italy surrendered, and German troops were forced to defend an additional front in Italy.

After the surrender of Germany, the remaining German territory and Berlin were partitioned by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] into four military occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the ''[[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]'' (''Bundesrepublik Deutschland''); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the ''[[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]'' (''Deutsche Demokratische Republik'', or DDR). They were informally known as &quot;West Germany&quot; and &quot;East Germany&quot;. East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose [[Bonn]] as a provisional capital,  to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was an artificial and temporary ''status quo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wise | first = Michael Z. | title = Capital dilemma: Germany's search for a new architecture of democracy| year = 1998| publisher = Princeton Architectural Press | isbn =978-1-56898-134-5 | page = 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

West Germany, established as a federal parliamentary republic with a &quot;[[social market economy]]&quot;, was allied with the United States, the UK and France. The country enjoyed prolonged economic growth beginning in the early 1950s ({{lang|de|''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]''}}). West Germany joined [[NATO]] in 1955 and was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] in 1957. East Germany was an [[Eastern bloc]] state under political and military control by the [[USSR]] via the latter's occupation forces and the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Though East Germany claimed to be a democracy, political power was exercised solely by leading members (''[[Politburo|Politbüro]]'') of the communist-controlled [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED), supported by the [[Stasi]], an immense secret service,&lt;ref name=&quot;spiegel_20080311&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,540771,00.html|title = New Study Finds More Stasi Spooks|author = maw/dpa|date = 11 March 2008|work = Spiegel Online – english site (www.spiegel.de/international)|publisher = [[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate  = 30 October 2011|quote = 189,000 people were informers for the Stasi – the former Communist secret police – when East Germany collapsed in 1989 – 15,000 more than previous studies had suggested.

Tensions between East and West Germany were reduced in the early 1970s by [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Willy Brandt]]'s {{lang|de|''[[Ostpolitik]]''}}. In summer 1989, Hungary decided to dismantle the [[Iron Curtain]] and open the borders, causing the emigration of thousands of [[East Germans]] to West Germany via Hungary. This had devastating effects on the [[East Germany|GDR]], where regular [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|mass demonstrations]] received increasing support. The East German authorities unexpectedly eased the border restrictions, allowing East German citizens to travel to the West; originally intended to help retain East Germany as a state, the opening of the border actually led to an acceleration of the [[Die Wende|''Wende'' reform process]]. This culminated in the ''[[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|Two Plus Four Treaty]]'' a year later on 12 September 1990, under which the four occupying powers renounced their rights under the [[German Instrument of Surrender|Instrument of Surrender]], and Germany regained full sovereignty. This permitted [[German reunification]] on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the five re-established states of the former GDR ([[New states of Germany|new states]] or &quot;neue Länder&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;state&quot;/&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Germany}}
[[File:Deutschland topo.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|Topographic map]]

Germany is in Western and Central Europe, bordering [[Denmark]] in the north, [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]] in the east, [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] in the south, [[France]] and [[Luxembourg]] in the south-west, and [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] in the north-west. It lies mostly between latitudes [[47th parallel north|47°]] and [[55th parallel north|55° N]] (the tip of [[Sylt]] is just north of 55°), and longitudes [[5th meridian east|5°]] and [[16th meridian east|16° E]]. The territory covers {{convert|357021|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, consisting of {{convert|349223|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of land and {{convert|7798|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of water. It is the seventh largest country by area in Europe and the [[List of countries by area|62nd largest in the world]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt;

Elevation ranges from the mountains of the [[Alps]] (highest point: the [[Zugspitze]] at {{convert|2962|m|ft|0|disp=s}}) in the south to the shores of the [[North Sea]] (Nordsee) in the north-west and the [[Baltic Sea]] (Ostsee) in the north-east. The forested uplands of central Germany and the lowlands of northern Germany (lowest point: [[Wilstermarsch]] at {{convert|3.54|m|ft|1|disp=s}} below sea level) are traversed by such major rivers as the [[Rhine]], [[Danube]] and [[Elbe]].  Glaciers are found in the Alpine region, but are experiencing deglaciation. Significant natural resources are iron ore, coal, [[potash]], timber, [[lignite]], [[uranium]], copper, natural gas, salt, nickel, [[arable land]] and water.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gm.html| title = World Factbook | accessdate = 26 March 2011|publisher=CIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
Most of Germany has a [[temperate|temperate seasonal climate]] in which humid westerly winds predominate. The climate is moderated by the [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]], the northern extension of the [[Gulf Stream]]. This warmer water affects the areas bordering the North Sea; consequently in the north-west and the north the climate is [[oceanic climate|oceanic]]. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Rainfall]] occurs year-round, especially in the summer. Winters are mild and summers tend to be cool, though temperatures can exceed {{convert|30|°C|°F|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;climate&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate in Germany|url=http://www.germanculture.com.ua/library/facts/bl_climate.htm|publisher=GermanCulture|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The east has a more [[continental climate]]; winters can be very cold and summers very warm, and long dry periods are frequent. Central and southern Germany are transition regions which vary from moderately oceanic to continental. In addition to the maritime and continental climates that predominate over most of the country, the Alpine regions in the extreme south and, to a lesser degree, some areas of the Central German Uplands have a mountain climate, characterised by lower temperatures and greater precipitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;climate&quot;/&gt;

Plants and animals are those generally common to middle Europe. Beeches, oaks, and other deciduous trees constitute one third of the forests; conifers are increasing as a result of reforestation. Spruce and fir trees predominate in the upper mountains, while pine and larch are found in sandy soil. There are many species of ferns, flowers, fungi, and mosses. Wild animals include deer, wild boar, mouflon, fox, badger, hare, and small numbers of beavers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Bekker |first=Henk |title=Adventure Guide Germany |year=2005 |publisher=Hunter |isbn =9781588435033 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reichstag building Berlin view from west before sunset.jpg|thumb|left|270px|The [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] in Berlin is the site of the German parliament (Bundestag).]]

Germany is a [[federal republic|federal]], [[parliamentary democratic|parliamentary]], [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic. The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitutional document known as the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|''Grundgesetz'']] (Basic Law). Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both chambers of parliament; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the rule of law are valid in perpetuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.btg-bestellservice.de/pdf/80201000.pdf|title=Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|date=October 2010|work=Deutscher Bundestag|publisher=Btg-bestellservice|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[President of Germany|president]] is the [[head of state]] and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. He is elected by the ''[[Bundesversammlung (Germany)|Bundesversammlung]]'' (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the ''Bundestag'' and an equal number of state delegates. The second-highest official in the [[German order of precedence]] is the ''Bundestagspräsident'' ([[President of the Bundestag|President of the ''Bundestag'']]), who is elected by the ''Bundestag'' and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body. The third-highest official and the [[head of government]] is the Chancellor, who is appointed by the ''Bundespräsident'' after being elected by the ''Bundestag''.&lt;ref name=&quot;state&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Bundespräsidentenpaar 9694.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Christian Wulff]] (right) was the most recent President of Germany. The office is currently vacant.]]

The chancellor, currently [[Angela Merkel]], is the head of government and exercises [[executive (government)|executive power]], similar to the role of a Prime Minister in other parliamentary democracies. Federal [[legislative power]] is vested in the parliament consisting of the ''[[Bundestag]]'' (Federal Diet) and ''[[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]'' (Federal Council), which together form the legislative body. The ''Bundestag'' is elected through [[direct election]]s, by [[proportional representation]] ([[mixed member proportional representation|mixed-member]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt; The members of the ''Bundesrat'' represent the governments of the sixteen federated states and are members of the state cabinets.&lt;ref name=&quot;state&quot;/&gt;

Since 1949, the party system has been dominated by the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] with all chancellors hitherto being member of either party. However, the smaller liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (which has had members in the ''Bundestag'' since 1949) and the [[Alliance '90/The Greens]] (which has controlled seats in parliament since 1983) have also played important roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/germany/159.htm|title=Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany has a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law system]] based on [[Roman law]] with some references to [[Germanic law]]. The ''[[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Bundesverfassungsgericht]]'' (Federal Constitutional Court) is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of [[judicial review]].&lt;ref name=&quot;state&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/en/index.html|title=Federal Constitutional Court|publisher=Bundesverfassungsgericht|accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's supreme court system, called ''Oberste Gerichtshöfe des Bundes'', is specialised: for civil and criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the [[inquisitorial system|inquisitorial]] [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|Federal Court of Justice]], and for other affairs the courts are the [[Federal Labor Court of Germany|Federal Labour Court]], the [[Bundessozialgericht|Federal Social Court]], the [[Federal Finance Court of Germany|Federal Finance Court]] and the [[Federal Administrative Court of Germany|Federal Administrative Court]].

Germany comprises [[States of Germany|sixteen states]] that are collectively referred to as ''Länder''.&lt;ref&gt;The individual denomination is either ''Land'' [state], ''Freistaat'' [free state] or ''Freie (und) Hansestadt'' [free (and) Hanseatic city].&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bundesrat.de/nn_11006/EN/organisation-en/laender-en/laender-en-node.html?__nnn=true|title= The Federal States|publisher=[[Bundesrat of Germany]]|work = www.bundesrat.de|accessdate=17 July 2011}} &lt;br/&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/DE/Infoservice/Terminologie/Bundeslaender/Uebersicht_node.html|title = Amtliche Bezeichnung der Bundesländer|work = www.auswaertiges-amt.de|publisher = [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Federal Foreign Office]]|language = German|trans_title = Official denomination of federated states|format = PDF; download file „Englisch“|accessdate = 22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to differences in size and population the [[States of Germany#Further subdivisions|subdivision of these states]] varies, especially between [[city states]] (''Stadtstaaten'') and states with larger territories (''Flächenländer''). For regional administrative purposes five states, namely Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony, consist of a total of 22 [[Regierungsbezirke|Government Districts]] (''Regierungsbezirke''). {{As of|2009}} Germany is divided into 403 [[Districts of Germany|districts]] (''Kreise'') on municipal level, these consist of 301 [[List of rural districts of Germany|rural districts]] and 102 [[Urban districts of Germany|urban districts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.destatis.de/jetspeed/portal/cms/Sites/destatis/Internet/DE/Content/Statistiken/Regionales/Gemeindeverzeichnis/Administrativ/Aktuell/04__KreiseAktuell,property=file.xls|title=Kreisfreie Städte und Landkreise nach Fläche und Bevölkerung 31.12.2009|format=XLS|month=October|year=2010|publisher=[[Statistisches Bundesamt]] Deutschland|language=German|accessdate=26 September 2011}}{{dead link|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Germany}}

German is the official and predominant spoken language in Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurobarometer Languages&quot;/&gt; It is one of 23 official languages in the European Union, and one of the three [[working language]]s of the [[European Commission]]. Recognised native minority languages in Germany are Danish, [[Low German]], [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]], [[Romany language|Romany]], and [[Frisian languages|Frisian]]; they are officially protected by the [[ECRML]]. The most used immigrant languages are [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], Polish, the [[Balkan languages]], and Russian; 67% of German citizens claim to be able to communicate in at least one foreign language and 27% in at least two languages other than their own.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurobarometer Languages&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Eurobarometer 243: Europeans and their Languages (Survey)|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[European Commission]]|year=2006|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf| accessdate= 28 March 2011}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Eurobarometer 243: Europeans and their Languages (Executive Summary)|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[European Commission]]|year=2006|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_sum_en.pdf |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard German is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] and is closely related to and classified alongside English, [[Low German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and the Frisian languages. To a lesser extent, it is also related to the [[East Germanic languages|East]] (extinct) and [[North Germanic languages]]. Most German vocabulary is derived from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Many tongues, one family. Languages in the European Union|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |author=[[European Commission]] |year=2004|url=http://ec.europa.eu/publications/booklets/move/45/en.pdf |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant minorities of words are derived from Latin and Greek, with a smaller amount from French and most recently English (known as [[Denglisch]]). German is written using the Latin alphabet. German [[dialect]]s, traditional local varieties traced back to the Germanic tribes, are distinguished from [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of [[standard German]] by their [[lexicon]], [[phonology]], and [[syntax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sprechen Sie Deutsch? |url=http://www.economist.com/node/15731354 |accessdate=16 April 2011 |newspaper=The Economist |date=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Germany}}
[[File:Heidelberg Universitätsbibliothek 2003.jpg|thumb|left|The [[University of Heidelberg]] was established in 1386.]]
Over 99% of Germans age 15 and above are estimated to be able to read and write.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;/&gt; However, a growing number of inhabitants are functionally illiterate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vhs-sachsen.de/uploads/media/Executive_Summary_leo_v8_Journalismusfassung.pdf |title=leo.- Level One Survey.

Since the 1960s, a reform movement attempted to unify secondary education in a ''Gesamtschule'' ([[comprehensive school]]); several West German states later simplified their school system to two or three tiers. A system of apprenticeship called ''Duale Ausbildung'' (&quot;dual education&quot;) allows pupils in [[vocational training]] to learn in a company as well as in a state-run vocational school.&lt;ref name=&quot;ED&quot;/&gt;

Optional [[kindergarten]] education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is [[compulsory education|compulsory]] for at least nine years. Primary education usually lasts for four years and public schools are not stratified at this stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;ED&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Germany.pdf |title=Country profile: Germany |publisher=Library of Congress |date=April 2008 |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, secondary education includes three traditional types of schools focused on different levels of academic ability: the ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' enrols the most gifted children and prepares students for university studies; the ''[[Realschule]]'' for intermediate students lasts six years; the ''[[Hauptschule]]'' prepares pupils for vocational education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.cuesta.edu/intlang/german/education.html |title=The Educational System in Germany |publisher=Cuesta College |date=31 August 2002 |accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general entrance requirement for university is [[Abitur]], a qualification normally based on continuous assessment during the last few years at school and final examinations; however there are a number of exceptions, and precise requirements vary, depending on the state, the university and the subject. Germany's universities are recognised internationally; in the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]] (ARWU) for 2008, six of the top 100 universities in the world are in Germany, and 18 of the top 200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 100 World Universities|publisher=[[Academic Ranking of World Universities]] |url=http://www.arwu.org/rank2008/ARWU2008_A(EN).htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080822124509/http://www.arwu.org/rank2008/ARWU2008_A(EN).htm |archivedate=2008-08-22 |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all German universities are public institutions, charging tuition fees of €50–500 per semester for each student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studyineurope.eu/study-in-germany/admission/tuition-fees|title=Tuition Fees at university in Germany|publisher=StudyinEurope.eu|year=2009|accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous German painters have enjoyed international prestige through their work in diverse artistic styles. [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Matthias Grünewald]], and [[Albrecht Dürer]] were important artists of the [[Renaissance]], [[Caspar David Friedrich]] of [[Romanticism]], and [[Max Ernst]] of [[Surrealism]]. Architectural contributions from Germany include the [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian architecture|Ottonian styles]], which were precursors of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]. The region later became the site of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] art. Germany was particularly important in the early [[modern architecture|modern movement]], especially through the [[Bauhaus]] movement founded by [[Walter Gropius]]. [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] became one of the world's most renowned architects in the second half of the 20th century. He conceived of the glass façade skyscraper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2006|title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=880|isbn=0-19-860678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[German literature]] can be traced back to the Middle Ages and the works of writers such as [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] and [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]. Well-known German authors include [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]]. The collections of folk tales published by the [[Brothers Grimm]] popularised [[German folklore]] on an international level.

German philosophy is historically significant. [[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s contributions to [[rationalism]]; the establishment of classical [[German idealism]] by [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]]; [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s composition of metaphysical pessimism; the formulation of [[communist theory]] by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]; [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s development of [[perspectivism]]; [[Gottlob Frege]]'s contributions to the dawn of [[analytic philosophy]]; [[Martin Heidegger]]'s works on Being; and the development of the [[Frankfurt school]] by [[Max Horkheimer]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]] have been particularly influential. In the 21st century Germany has contributed to the development of contemporary analytic philosophy in continental Europe, along with France, Austria, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Searle, John|year=1987|title=The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy|chapter=Introduction|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 the Austrian-American [[Josef von Sternberg]] directed ''[[The Blue Angel]]'', the first major German [[sound film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Bordwell |first= David |authorlink= David Bordwell |coauthors= Thompson, Kristin |title= Film History: An Introduction |origyear= 1994 |edition= 2nd |year= 2003 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn= 978-0-07-115141-2 |page= 204 |chapter= The Introduction of Sound}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s and 1980s, [[New German Cinema]] directors such as [[Volker Schlöndorff]], [[Werner Herzog]], [[Wim Wenders]], and [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]] put West German cinema on the international stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fassbinderfoundation.de/node.php/en/home|title=Rainer Werner Fassbinder|publisher=Fassbinder Foundation|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The annual [[European Film Award]]s ceremony is held every other year in Berlin, home of the [[European Film Academy]] (EFA); the [[Berlin Film Festival]], held annually since 1951, is one of the world's foremost film festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiapf.org/pdf/2006accreditedFestivalsDirectory.pdf |title=2006 FIAPF accredited Festivals Directory|publisher=International Federation of Film Producers Associations|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, films such as ''[[Good Bye Lenin!]]'' (2003), ''[[Head-On|Gegen die Wand (Head-on)]]'' (2004), ''[[Der Untergang|Der Untergang (Downfall)]]'' (2004), and ''[[Der Baader Meinhof Komplex]]'' (2008) have had international success.

German cuisine varies from region to region. The southern regions of [[Bavarian cuisine|Bavaria]] and Swabia, for instance, share a culinary culture with Switzerland and Austria.  In all regions, meat is often eaten in sausage form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.foodfromgermany.org/consumer/facts/guidetosausages.cfm | title = Guide to German Sausages &amp; Meat Products | publisher = German Foods North America | accessdate = 11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Organic food]] has gained a market share of ca. 2%, and is expected to increase further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fao.org/organicag/display/work/display_2.asp?country=DEU&amp;lang=en&amp;disp=summaries | title =Germany Country Profiles for Organic Agriculture | publisher= Food and Agriculture Organization | accessdate = 6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although wine is becoming more popular in many parts of Germany, the national alcoholic drink is beer.

'''Guido Westerwelle''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡiːdo ˈvɛstɐˌvɛlə}}; born December 27, 1961) is a [[Germany|German]] liberal politician, who, since 28 October 2009, has been serving as the [[Foreign Minister of Germany|Foreign Minister]] in the [[Cabinet Merkel II|second cabinet]] of Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]], and who was [[Vice Chancellor of Germany]] from 2009 to 2011. He is the first [[openly gay]] person to hold either of those positions. He has been the chairman of the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party of Germany]] (FDP) since May 2001, but stepped down in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2011-04/fdp-westerwelle-parteivorsitz-2 &quot;Westerwelle gibt den FDP-Vorsitz ab&quot;] ''Die Zeit''  (April 3, 2011) {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lawyer by profession, he has been a member of the [[Bundestag]] since 1996.

==Early life and education==
Guido Westerwelle was born in [[Bad Honnef]] in the German state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. He graduated from [[Ernst Moritz Arndt]] [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in 1980 after academic struggles resulted in his departure from previous institutions where he was considered an average student at best, but substandard otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;[Vgl. Setzen, Sechs! - Schulgeschichten aus Deutschland (3/3). Experiment Schule. Dokumentarfilm von Susanne Bausch im Auftrag des SWR. Deutsche Erstausstrahlung am 22. Dezember 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He studied law at the [[University of Bonn]] from 1980 to 1987. Following the First and Second State Law Examinations in 1987 and 1991 respectively, he began practicing as an attorney in [[Bonn]] in 1991. In 1994, he earned a doctoral degree in law from [[FernUniversität Hagen]].

==Career in the FDP==
Westerwelle joined the FDP in 1980. He was a founding member of the ''[[Young Liberals (Germany)|Junge Liberale]]'', the youth organization of that party, and was its chairman from 1983 to 1988. 

Having been a member of the Executive Board of the FDP since 1988, he first gained national prominence in 1994, when he was appointed Secretary General of the party. As such, he was a notable proponent of an unlimited [[free market]] economy and took a leading part in drafting a new party programme. 

In 1996, Westerwelle was first elected a member of the Bundestag, filling in for Heinz Lanfermann, who had resigned from his seat after entering the Ministry of Justice. In 1998, Westerwelle was re-elected to parliament.

In 2001, he succeeded [[Wolfgang Gerhardt]] as party chairman, who, however, remained chairman of the FDP's parliamentary group. Westerwelle, the youngest party chairman at the time, emphasized economics and education, and espoused a strategy initiated by his deputy [[Jürgen Möllemann]], who, as chairman of the [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] branch of party, had led his party back into the state parliament, gaining 9.8% of the vote. This strategy, transferred to the federal level, was dubbed ''Project 18'',  referring both to the envisioned percentage and the German age of majority. Leading up to the 2002 elections, he positioned his party in ''equidistance'' to the major parties and refused to commit his party to a coalition with either the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democrats]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]]. He was also declared the FDP's candidate for the office of [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|chancellor]]. Since the FDP had never claimed such a candicacy (and hasn't done since) and had no chance of attaining it against the two major parties, this move was widely seen as flippant political marketing alongside other moves, such as driving around in a campaign van dubbed ''Guidomobile'', wearing the figure ''18'' on the soles of his shoes or appearance in the [[Big Brother (TV series)|''Big Brother'' TV show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=sueddeutsche.de GmbH, Munich, Germany |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/488/399272/text/ |title=FDP-Kanzlerkandidat - „Eher wird Pieper Päpstin als Westerwelle Kanzler“ - Deutschland |publisher=sueddeutsche.de |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the [[German federal election, 2002|federal elections]] yielded a slight increase of the FDP's vote from 6.8% to 7.4%. Despite this setback, he was reelected as party chairman in 2003.

In the [[German federal election, 2005|federal elections of 2005]], Westerwelle was his party's frontrunner. When neither Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]]'s Social Democrats and Greens nor a coalition of Christian and Free Democrats, favoured by [[Angela Merkel]] and Westerwelle, managed to gain a majority of seats, Westerwelle rejected overtures by Chancellor Schröder to save his chancellorship by entering his coalition, preferring to become one of the leaders of the disparate opposition of the subsequently formed &quot;Grand Coalition&quot; of Christian and Social Democrats, with Merkel as Chancellor. Westerwelle became a vocal critic of the new government. In 2006, according to an internal agreement, Westerwelle succeeded Wolfgang Gerhardt as chairman of the parliamentary group.

==Foreign Minister and Vice Chancellor of Germany==
In the [[German federal election, 2009|federal elections of 2009]], Westerwelle committed his party to a coalition with Dr Merkel's CDU/CSU, ruling out a coalition with Social Democrats and Greens, and led his party to unprecedented 14.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/en/bundestagswahlen/BTW_BUND_09/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/index.html |title=Übersicht |publisher=Bundeswahlleiter.de |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with earlier announcements, he formed a coalition government with CDU/CSU. On October 28, he was sworn in as [[Foreign Minister of Germany|Foreign Minister]] and [[Vice Chancellor of Germany|Vice-Chancellor]], becoming the head of the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Foreign Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Handelsblatt, Düsseldorf, Germany |url=http://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/der-schwarz-gelbe-showdown-beginnt;2469840 |title=Der schwarz-gelbe Showdown beginnt - Politik - Deutschland |publisher=Handelsblatt.com |date=2009-10-16 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE58Q27P20090927 |title=German elections seen triggering brief stocks rally |publisher=Reuters |date=2009-09-27 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6848166.ece ]{{dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 he announced he wouldn't be taking his husband to hostile countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.de/politics/20100811-29089.html &quot;Westerwelle won't take partner to anti-gay lands&quot;], The Local.

His deputies at the Foreign Office are [[Werner Hoyer]] and [[Cornelia Pieper]] as Ministers of State. Hoyer previously held the same office in the [[Cabinet Kohl V]].

By May 2011 however his party had collapsed in several states, including [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] and [[Bremen]] where they failed to secure the 5% threshold to be seated in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/may/25/germany-liberal-collapse-free-democrats &quot;Germany's liberal collapse parallels Clegg's fate&quot;], Hans Kundnani. The Guardian. May 25, 2011. Accessed June 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Westerwelle then stepped down as party leader. By July the party was only receiving 3% support in opinion polls, a record low,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agi.it/english-version/world/elenco-notizie/201107271553-pol-ren1058-german_liberals_collapse_to_3_percent &quot;GERMAN LIBERALS COLLAPSE TO 3 PERCENT&quot;], AGI. 27 july 2011. Retrieved 7 aug 2011&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting what political insiders had called his &quot;last stand&quot; in January, comparing Westerwelle and his party to [[Ahab (Moby-Dick)|Captain Ahab]] and the [[Pequod (Moby-Dick)|Pequod]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,738173,00.html &quot;Guido Westerwelle's Last Stand&quot;], Rolland Nelles.

In July 2011 Westerwelle was the [[President of the United Nations Security Council]] as he headed the German delegation to the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2011/sc10325.doc.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positions==
Westerwelle is a staunch supporter of the [[free-market economy|free market]] and has proposed reforms to curtail the German [[welfare state]] and deregulate German labor law. In an interview in February 2003, Westerwelle described [[trade unions]] as a &quot;plague on our country&quot; and said union officials were &quot;the pall bearers of the welfare state and of the prosperity in our country&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;brinkmann&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Controversy==
His chairmanship has also seen considerable controversy. Critics inside and outside the FDP have accused him of focusing on [[public relations]], as opposed to developing and promoting sound [[policy|public policy]], especially in the election campaign of 2002. Westerwelle himself, who was made party chairman particularly because his predecessor [[Wolfgang Gerhardt]] had been viewed by many as dull and stiff, has labeled his approach as ''Spaßpolitik'' (fun politics) in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1918826,00.html |date=2009-09-07 |title= Guido Westerwelle, Germany's Mittelman |work=''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' |accessdate=2010-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.welt.de/print-welt/article239101/Der_Samurai_der_Spasspolitik.html?print=yes |date=2003-07-03 |title= Der Samurai der Spaßpolitik |work=''[[Die Welt|Welt Online]]'' |accessdate=2008-04-09 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

On September 27, 2009, at a press conference after the election, Westerwelle refused to answer a question in English from a BBC reporter, stating that &quot;it is normal to speak German in Germany&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.de/politics/20090928-22217.html |title=Future foreign minister Westerwelle refuses to answer English question |publisher=thelocal.de |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/14558508 Off to the Auswärtiges Amt] ''[[The Economist]]'' 1 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

He made public statements in 2010 about the &quot;welfare state&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,678319,00.html |title=Dekadenz-Sprüche: Westerwelles explosives Oppositions-Recycling - SPIEGEL ONLINE - Nachrichten - Politik |publisher=Spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that promising the people effortless prosperity may lead to &quot;late Roman decadence&quot;, in reference to a verdict in the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] regarding [[Hartz IV]]. This caused quite a stir in Germany.

His official trips as foreign minister have included his partner Michael Mronz, an event manager, and Ralf Marohn, a partner in his brother's company,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,684722,00.html |title=Liberaler Klüngel: FDP-Reiseaffäre |publisher=Spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; also causing controversy. Westerwelle and the FDP defended this by saying that it is normal for foreign ministers to take industry representatives on their trips, ignoring the fact that these particular representatives had a personal [[cronyism|relationship]] with him.

In late November 2010, [[United States diplomatic cables leak|leaked U.S. diplomatic cables]] revealed that American diplomats considered Westerwelle an obstacle to deeper [[Germany – United States relations|transatlantic]] relations and were skeptical of Westerwelle's abilities, with one cable comparing Westerwelle unfavorably to former German foreign minister [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,731645-2,00.html|title=How America Views the Germans|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=30 November 2010 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Ministry and the Past===
In 2010, the Foreign Ministry released a report prepared for Westerwelle called [[The Ministry and the Past]], which alleged the ministry's collusion with the Nazis. Westerwelle said the report &quot;shamed&quot; the institution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/german-fm-shamed-by-ministry-s-collaboration-with-hitler-1.321627 &quot;German FM 'shamed' by ministry's collaboration with Hitler&quot;], Haaretz. May 28, 2010. Accessed June 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Espionage===
On December 3, 2010, Westerwelle dismissed his personal assistant Helmut Metzner following a [[Wikileaks]] diplomatic cables release which led to Metzner admitting that he regularly spied for the Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://euobserver.com/9/31416|title=Heads start rolling in WikiLeaks affair

'''Hamburg''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|h|æ|m|b|ɜr|ɡ}}; {{IPA-de|ˈhambʊɐ̯k}}, local pronunciation {{IPA-dedia|ˈhambʊɪç|}}; [[Low German]]/[[West Low German|Low Saxon]]: ''Hamborg'' {{IPA-dedia|ˈhaˑmbɔːx|}}) is the [[List of cities in Germany with more than 100,000 inhabitants|second-largest city]] in [[Germany]] and the [[Largest cities of the European Union by population within city limits|seventh-largest city]] in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citymayors.com/features/euro_cities1.html |title=Europe's largest cities |work=City Mayors Statistics |accessdate=2009-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is home to over 1.8 million people, while the [[Hamburg Metropolitan Region]] (including parts of the neighbouring [[States of Germany|Federal States]] of [[Lower Saxony]] and [[Schleswig-Holstein]]) has more than 4.3 million inhabitants. Situated on the river [[Elbe]], the [[port of Hamburg]] is the second largest port in Europe (after the Port of [[Port of Rotterdam|Rotterdam]]) and it is among the twenty largest in the world.

Hamburg's official name is the '''''Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg''''' (German: ''Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg'').&lt;ref name=constitution&gt;[[Constitution of Hamburg]] {{Citation |title=Verfassung der Freien und Hansestadt Hamburg |url=http://hh.juris.de/hh/gesamt/Verf_HA.htm#Verf_HA_rahmen |date=1952-06-06 |edition=11th |accessdate=2008-09-21}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reflects [[History of Hamburg|Hamburg's history]] as a member of the medieval [[Hanseatic League]], as a [[free imperial city]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and that Hamburg is a [[city-state]] and one of the sixteen States of Germany.

Hamburg is a major [[transport hub]] in [[Northern Germany]] and is one of the most [[Affluency|affluent]] cities in Europe.{{citation}} It has become a media and industrial centre, with plants and facilities belonging to ''[[Airbus]]'', ''[[Blohm + Voss]]'' and ''[[Aurubis]]''. The radio and television broadcaster ''[[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]]'' and publishers such as ''[[Gruner + Jahr]]'' and ''[[Der Spiegel|Spiegel]]-Verlag'' are pillars of the important media industry in Hamburg. In total, there are more than 120,000 enterprises.

The city is a major tourist destination for both domestic and overseas visitors; Hamburg ranked 23rd in the world for livability in 2009,&lt;ref name=&quot;theage.com.au&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/executive-style/culture/melbourne-pips-sydney-again-in-livability-stakes-20090617-chzy.html |location=Melbourne |work=The Age |first=Paola |last=Totaro |title=Melbourne pips Sydney again in livability stakes |date=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; higher in some alternate rankings&lt;ref name=&quot;theage.com.au&quot;/&gt; and in 2010 the city ranked 10th in the world.

==Geography==
Hamburg is located on the southern point of the [[Jutland Peninsula]], directly between [[Continental Europe]] to its south, [[Scandinavia]] to its north, the [[North Sea]] to its west, and the [[Baltic Sea]] to its east. Hamburg is located on the River [[Elbe]] at its confluence with the [[Alster]] and [[Bille]]. The city centre is situated around the [[Binnenalster]] (&quot;Inner Alster&quot;) and [[Außenalster]] (&quot;Outer Alster&quot;) both of which were originally formed by impounding the River Alster to create lakes. The island of [[Neuwerk]] and two small neighbouring islands Scharhörn and Nigehörn, located in the [[Wadden Sea National Parks|Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park]], are also part of Hamburg.&lt;ref&gt;Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park Act {{Citation |title=Gesetz über den Nationalpark Hamburgisches Wattenmeer |url=http://www.landesrecht.hamburg.de/jportal/portal/page/bshaprod.psml?doc.id=jlr-WattMGHArahmen&amp;st=lr&amp;showdoccase=1&amp;paramfromHL=true#focuspoint|date=1990-04-09 |accessdate=2011-02-26}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neighbourhoods of [[Neuenfelde]], [[Cranz, Hamburg|Cranz]], Francop and [[Finkenwerder]] are part of the ''[[Altes Land]]'' region (old land), the biggest contiguous fruit-producing region in [[Central Europe]]. The neighbourhood of [[Neugraben-Fischbek]] has Hamburg's highest elevation, the [[Hasselbrack]] at {{convert|116.2|m|0}} [[Above mean sea level|AMSL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=''Geologisches Landesamt Hamburg'' (Hamburg State Geological Department) |title=Statistisches Jahrbuch 2007/2008 |year=2007 |publisher=Statistisches Amt für Hamburg und Schleswig-Holstein |location=Hamburg |issn=1614-8045}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
Hamburg has an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb''). Hamburg's climate is influenced by its proximity to the coast and marine air masses that originate over the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Nearby wetlands also enjoy a maritime temperate climate. Snowfall is rare, generally occurring once or twice a year.

The warmest months in Hamburg are June, July, and August, with high temperatures of {{convert|19.9|to|22.2|C|F}}. The coldest are December, January, and February, with low temperatures of {{convert|-1.4|to|0.0|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=WMO/&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Hamburg}}
[[File:Limes.saxoniae.wmt.png|thumb|The ''[[Limes Saxoniae]]'' border between the [[Saxons]] and the Slavic [[Obotrites]], established about 810.]]

The first historic name for the city was, according to [[Claudius Ptolemy]]'s reports, '''Treva'''.
But the city takes its modern name, Hamburg, from the first permanent building on the site, a castle whose construction was ordered by the Emperor [[Charlemagne]] in AD 808. The [[castle]] was built on rocky terrain in a marsh between the [[Alster|River Alster]] and the [[Elbe|River Elbe]] as a defence against [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] incursion. The castle was named ''Hammaburg'', ''burg'' meaning castle or fort. The origin of the ''Hamma'' term remains uncertain,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;cite id=Verg&gt;{{Citation |last1=Verg |first1=Erich |last2=Verg|first2=Martin|year=2007 |title=Das Abenteuer das Hamburg heißt |edition=4th |location=Hamburg |publisher=Ellert&amp;Richter |isbn=9783831901371 |page=8}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does the exact location of the castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hammaburg &amp;ndash; der große Irrtum |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2007/12/12/826430.html |date=2007-12-12 |publisher=Hamburg Abendblatt |accessdate=2008-09-30}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 834, Hamburg was designated the seat of a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Prince-Bishop|bishopric]], whose first bishop, [[Ansgar]], became known as the Apostle of the North. Two years later, Hamburg was united with [[Archdiocese of Bremen|Bremen]] as the bishopric of Hamburg-Bremen.&lt;ref name=verg15&gt;[[#Verg|Verg (2007)]], p.15&lt;/ref&gt; In 1529, the city embraced [[Lutheranism]], and Hamburg subsequently received [[Protestantism|Protestant]] refugees from the [[Netherlands]] and [[France]] and, in the 17th century, [[Portuguese Jewish community in Hamburg|Sephardi Jews]] from [[Portugal]].

Hamburg was destroyed and occupied several times. In 845, a fleet of 600 [[Viking]] ships sailed up the [[Elbe|River Elbe]] and destroyed Hamburg which, at that time, was a town of around 500 inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;verg15&quot;/&gt; In 1030, the city was burned down by King [[Mieszko II Lambert]] of [[Poland]]. [[Valdemar II of Denmark]] raided and occupied Hamburg in 1201 and in 1214. The [[Black Death]] killed at least 60% of Hamburg's population in 1350.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Snell |first=Melissa |url=http://historymedren.about.com/od/theblackdeath/a/greatmortality_2.htm |title=The Great Mortality |publisher=Historymedren.about.com |accessdate=2009-04-19 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamburg had several great fires, the most notable ones in 1284 and 1842. In 1842, about a quarter of the inner city was destroyed in the &quot;Great Fire&quot;. This conflagration started on the night of the 4 May 1842 and was extinguished on 8 May. It destroyed three churches, the town hall, and many other buildings, killing 51 people and leaving an estimated 20,000 homeless. Reconstruction took more than 40 years.

[[File:Jmdavid hamburg.jpg|thumb|Hamburg in 1811]]
In 1189, by imperial charter, [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I &quot;Barbarossa&quot;]] granted Hamburg the status of an [[Free imperial city|Imperial Free City]] and tax-free access up the Lower Elbe into the North Sea. In 1265, an allegedly forged letter was presented to or by the Rath of Hamburg.&lt;ref name=verg26&gt;[[#Verg|Verg (2007)]], p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; This charter, along with Hamburg's proximity to the main trade routes of the [[North Sea]] and [[Baltic Sea]], quickly made it a major port in [[Northern Europe]]. Its trade alliance with [[Lübeck]] in 1241 marks the origin and core of the powerful Hanseatic League of trading cities. On 8 November 1266, a contract between [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] and Hamburg's traders allowed them to establish a ''hanse'' in London. This was the first time in history that the word ''hanse'' was used for the trading guild of the [[Hanseatic League]].&lt;ref name=verg30&gt;[[#Verg|Verg (2007)]], p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The first description of civil, criminal and procedural law for a city in Germany in the German language, the ''Ordeelbook'' (''Ordeel'': sentence) was written by the solicitor of the [[senate of Hamburg]], ''Jordan von Boitzenburg'', in 1270.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Medieval Origins of Modern Legal Education: Between Church and State |first=David S. |last=Clark |journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law |volume=Vol. 35, No. 4 |year=1987 |pages=653–719 |publisher=American Society of Comparative Law |doi=10.2307/840129 |issue=4 |jstor=840129}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 10, 1410, civil unrest forced a compromise (German:''Rezeß'', literally meaning: withdrawal). This is considered the first [[constitution of Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Verg|Verg (2007)]], p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806, the [[Free imperial city|Free Imperial City]] of Hamburg was not incorporated into a larger administrative area while retaining special privileges ([[Mediatization|mediatised]]), but became a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] state with the official title of the ''Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg''. Hamburg was briefly annexed by [[Napoleon I]] to the [[First French Empire]] (1810–14). Russian forces under [[Levin August, Count von Bennigsen|General Bennigsen]] finally freed the city in 1814. Hamburg reassumed its pre-1811 status as a city-state in 1814. The [[Congress of Vienna|Vienna Congress]] of 1815 confirmed Hamburg's independence and it became one of 39 sovereign states of the [[German Confederation]] (1815&amp;ndash;66).

In 1860, the state of Hamburg adopted a republican constitution. Hamburg became a city-state within the [[North German Confederation]] (1866&amp;ndash;71), the [[German Empire]] (1871&amp;ndash;1918) and during the period of the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919&amp;ndash;33). Hamburg experienced its fastest growth during the second half of the 19th century, when its population more than quadrupled to 800,000 as the growth of the city's [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] trade helped make it Europe's third-largest port. With [[Albert Ballin]] as its director, the [[Hamburg America Line|Hamburg-America Line]] became the world's largest [[Atlantic Ocean|transatlantic]] shipping company at the turn of the century. Shipping companies sailing to [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[India]] and [[East Asia]] were based in the city. Hamburg was the departure port for most Germans and [[Eastern Europe]]ans to emigrate to the [[United States]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Trading communities from all over the world established themselves here.

A major outbreak of [[cholera]] in 1892 was badly handled by the city government, which still retained an unusual degree of independence for a German city at the time. About 8,600 died in the largest German epidemic of the late 19th century, and the last major cholera epidemic in a major city of the Western world.

===Second World War===
[[File:Hamburg after the 1943 bombing.jpg|thumb|[[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|Hamburg after the 1943 bombing]]]]
In the [[Third Reich]], Hamburg was a ''[[Administrative division of Nazi Germany|Gau]]'' from 1934 until 1945. During [[World War II]] Hamburg suffered a series of Allied [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|air raids]],
which devastated much of the inhabited city as well as harbour areas. On 23 July 1943 a [[firestorm]] developed as a result of Allied firebombing and, spreading from the ''Hauptbahnhof'' (central station) and quickly moving south-east, completely destroyed entire boroughs, such as [[Hammerbrook]], [[Billbrook]] or [[Hamm-south]]. These densely populated working-class boroughs underwent a dramatic demographic change as a result as thousands of people perished in the flames.
While some of the destroyed boroughs have been rebuilt as residential areas after the war,
others such as Hammerbrook are nowadays purely commercial areas with almost no residential population.
The raids, codenamed [[Operation Gomorrah]] by the [[RAF]], killed about 40,000 civilians; the precise number is not known.
About 1 million civilians were evacuated in the aftermath of the raids.

At least 42,900 people are thought to have perished &lt;ref name=&quot;kz-neuengamme&quot;&gt;[http://www.kz-gedenkstaette-neuengamme.de Gedenkstätte Konzentrationslager Neuengamme]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Neuengamme concentration camp|Neuengamme]] [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] (situated about {{convert|25|km|0|abbr=on}} outside the city in the marshlands), mostly due to epidemics and in the [[SS Cap Arcona (1927)|bombing of evacuation vessels]] at the end of the war.

===Postwar history===
Hamburg surrendered without a fight to [[British Armed Forces|British Forces]] on 3 May 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Ortwin Pelc, Kriegsende in Hamburg, Hamburg 2005&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]], Hamburg was in the [[Allied-occupied Germany|British Zone of Occupation]] and became a state of the then [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] in 1949. On 16 February 1962, the [[North Sea flood of 1962|North Sea flood of that year]] caused the Elbe to rise to an all-time high, inundating one-fifth of Hamburg and killing more than 300 people. In 1961, [[the Beatles]] became famous by playing music in clubs in Hamburg.

The [[Inner German Border]] — only {{convert|50|km|mi|-1}} east of Hamburg — separated the city from most of its hinterland and further reduced Hamburg's global trade. After [[German reunification]] in 1990, and the accession of some [[Eastern Europe]]an and [[Baltic states|Baltic States]] into the [[European Union|EU]] in 2004, the [[Port of Hamburg]] has ambitions for regaining its position as the region's largest deep-sea port for container shipping and its major commercial and trading centre.

There were 856,132 men and 898,050 women in Hamburg. For every 1,000 males there were 1,049 females. In 2006 there were 16,089 births in Hamburg (of which 33.1% were to unmarried women), 6,921 marriages and 4,583 divorces. In the city, the population was spread out with 15.7% under the age of 18, and 18.8% were 65 years of age or older.&lt;ref name=&quot;fact2006buch&quot;/&gt;

Recent estimates put the number of people with a migrant background at 28% (487.000).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.statistik-nord.de/uploads/tx_standocuments/SI_SPEZIAL_V_2010_01.pdf |title=|publisher=|date=|accessdate=2011-06-01|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; European immigrants constitute 70% of the migrant population, while Africans and south Asians make up 6% and 19%, respectively.&lt;ref name=immigration/&gt; Immigrants come from 180 different countries, including [[Turkish people|Turkey]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Iran]] or [[Ghana]].

==Government==
{{See|Government of Hamburg|List of mayors of Hamburg}}

[[File:Hamburg town hall tower.JPG|thumb|upright|Hamburg City Hall (front view)]]
The city of Hamburg is one of 16 [[States of Germany|German states]], therefore the [[Government of Hamburg|Mayor of Hamburg]]'s office corresponds more to the role of a [[Minister-President|minister-president]] than to the one of a city mayor. As a [[States of Germany#Politics|German state government]], it is responsible for public education, correctional institutions and public safety; as a municipality, it is additionally responsible for libraries, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply and welfare services.

Since 1897, the seat of the government has been the [[Hamburg Rathaus]], with the office of the mayor, the meeting room for the Senate and the floor for the [[Hamburg Parliament]].&lt;ref name=rathaus&gt;{{Citation |title=Kleiner Rathausführer |location=Hamburg |publisher=[[Government of Hamburg#Ministries|State Chancellery]] |year=2006}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2001 until 2010, the mayor of Hamburg was [[Ole von Beust]],&lt;ref name=usatoday2008&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-02-24-Germany-elections_N.htm |title=German conservatives win most votes |accessdate=2008-08-13 |publisher=USA today |date=2008-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; who governed in Germany's first state-wide &quot;black-green&quot; coalition, consisting of the conservative [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] and the alternative GAL, which are Hamburg's regional wing of the [[Alliance '90/The Greens]] party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kopp |first=Martin |title=Geheime Absprachen zwischen CDU und Grünen |year=2007 |location=Hamburg |publisher=[[Die Welt]] |url=http://www.welt.de/hamburg/arti2318261/Geheime_Absprachen_zwischen_CDU_und_Gruenen.html |date=2008-08-12|accessdate=2008-08-13 |postscript=.}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Beust was briefly succeeded by [[Christoph Ahlhaus]] in 2010 but the coalition broke apart on November, 28. 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2010-11/cdu-gruene-hamburg Schwarz-Grün in Hamburg am Ende] in [[Die Zeit]] - online, revisited on November, 28. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 March 2011 [[Olaf Scholz]] (SPD) became mayor.

===Boroughs===
{{Main|Boroughs and quarters of Hamburg}}
[[File:Hamburg Subdivisions.svg|thumb|left|250px|Boroughs of Hamburg]]
[[File:Germany (2), Neuwerk, Scharhörn, Nigehörn.jpg|thumb|220px|The part of the North Sea in this aerial picture is called the [[Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park]] and belongs administratively to the borough of [[Hamburg-Mitte]]. Some 39 people live here on the island [[Neuwerk]] (visible just above the centre).]]

Hamburg is made up of 7 boroughs (German: ''Bezirke'') and subdivided into 105 quarters (German: ''Stadtteile''). There are also 180 localities (German: ''Ortsteile''). The urban organization is regulated by the Constitution of Hamburg and several laws.&lt;ref name=constitution/&gt;&lt;ref name=borough&gt;Borough Administration Act {{Citation |title=Bezirksverwaltungsgesetz (BezVG)

The last large annexation was done through the [[Greater Hamburg Act]] of 1937, when the cities [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]], [[Harburg, Hamburg|Harburg]] and [[Hamburg-Wandsbek|Wandsbek]] were merged into the state of Hamburg.&lt;ref name=greateract&gt;[[Greater Hamburg Act]] {{Citation |title=Groß-Hamburg-Gesetz |url=http://www.verfassungen.de/de/hh/hamburg37.htm |date=1937-01-26 |accessdate=2008-09-24}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Act of the Constitution and Administration of Hanseatic city of Hamburg'' established Hamburg as a state and a municipality.&lt;ref name=reichconst&gt;Reich Act of the Constitution and Administration of Hanseatic city of Hamburg {{Citation |title=Reichsgesetz über die Verfassung und Verwaltung der Hansestadt Hamburg |url=http://www.verfassungen.de/de/hh/hamburg37-1.htm |date=1937-12-09 |accessdate=2008-09-24}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the boroughs and quarters have been rearranged several times over the years.

Each borough is governed by a Borough Council (German: ''Bezirksversammlung'') and administered by a Municipal Administrator (German: ''Bezirksamtsleiter''). The boroughs of Hamburg are not independent municipalities. The power of borough governments is limited and subordinate to the [[Mayor of Hamburg|Senate of Hamburg]]. The borough administrator is elected by the Borough Council and thereafter requires confirmation and appointment by Hamburgs' Senate.&lt;ref name=borough/&gt; The quarters have no governing bodies of their own.

In 2008 the boroughs of Hamburg were Altona, Bergedorf, Eimsbüttel, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord, Harburg and Wandsbek.&lt;ref name=actareal&gt;Hamburg Act of Areal Organization {{Citation |title=Gesetz über die räumliche Gliederung der Freien und Hansestadt Hamburg (RäumGiG) |date=2006-07-06 |url=http://hh.juris.de/hh/gesamt/RGlG_HA.htm |accessdate=2008-09-24}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]]'' is the westernmost urban borough on the right bank of the Elbe river. From 1640 to 1864 Altona was under the administration of the Danish monarchy. Altona was an independent city until 1937. Politically, the following quarters are part of Altona: Altona-Altstadt, [[Altona-Nord]], [[Bahrenfeld]], [[Ottensen]], [[Othmarschen]], Groß Flottbek, [[Osdorf, Hamburg|Osdorf]], [[Lurup]], [[Nienstedten]], [[Blankenese]], [[Iserbrook]], [[Sülldorf]], [[Rissen]], Sternschanze.&lt;ref name=actareal/&gt;

''[[Bergedorf]]'' consists of the quarters [[Allermöhe]], [[Altengamme]], [[Bergedorf (quarter)|Bergedorf]]&amp;mdash;the centre of the former independent town, Billwerder, Curslack, Kirchwerder, [[Lohbrügge]], Moorfleet, [[Neuengamme]], Ochsenwerder, Reitbrook, Spadenland and Tatenberg.&lt;ref name=actareal/&gt;

''[[Eimsbüttel]]'' is split into nine quarters: Eidelstedt, [[Eimsbüttel (quarter)|Eimsbüttel]], Harvestehude, Hoheluft-West, Lokstedt, [[Niendorf, Hamburg|Niendorf]], [[Rotherbaum]], Schnelsen and Stellingen.&lt;ref name=actareal/&gt; Located within this borough is former Jewish neighbourhood Grindel.

''[[Hamburg-Mitte]]'' (&quot;Hamburg Centre&quot;) covers mostly the urban centre of the city of Hamburg and consists of the quarters Billbrook, Billstedt, Borgfelde, [[Finkenwerder]], [[HafenCity]], Hamm-Nord, Hamm-Mitte, Hamm-Süd, [[Hammerbrook]], [[Horn, Hamburg|Horn]], [[Kleiner Grasbrook]], [[Neuwerk]], [[Rothenburgsort]], [[St. Georg, Hamburg|St. Georg]], [[St. Pauli]], Steinwerder, [[Veddel]], Waltershof and [[Wilhelmsburg, Hamburg|Wilhelmsburg]].&lt;ref name=actareal/&gt; The quarters Hamburg-Altstadt (&quot;old town&quot;) and Neustadt (&quot;new town&quot;) are the historical origin of Hamburg.

''[[Hamburg-Nord]]'' contains the quarters [[Alsterdorf]], Barmbek-Nord, Barmbek-Süd, Dulsberg, Eppendorf, [[Fuhlsbüttel]], Groß Borstel, Hoheluft-Ost, Hohenfelde, [[Langenhorn, Hamburg|Langenhorn]], Ohlsdorf, Uhlenhorst and [[Winterhude]].&lt;ref name=actareal/&gt;

''[[Harburg, Hamburg|Harburg]]'' lies on the southern shores of the river Elbe and covers parts of the port of Hamburg, residential and rural areas, and some research institutes. The quarters are [[Altenwerder]], [[Cranz, Hamburg|Cranz]], Eißendorf, Francop, Gut Moor, [[Harburg (quarter)|Harburg]], Hausbruch, Heimfeld, Langenbek, Marmstorf, Moorburg, [[Neuenfelde]], [[Neugraben-Fischbek]], Neuland, Rönneburg, Sinstorf and Wilstorf.&lt;ref name=actareal/&gt;

Hamburg has architecturally significant buildings in a wide range of styles. There are, however, only few [[skyscraper]]s. On the other hand, churches like [[St. Nikolai, Hamburg|St. Nicholas's church]], the world's tallest building in the 19th century, are important landmarks. The skyline of Hamburg features the high spires of the principal churches (''Hauptkirchen'') [[St. Michaelis Church, Hamburg|St. Michael's Church]] (nicknamed “Michel&quot;), [[St. Peter's Church, Hamburg|St. Peter's Church]], [[St. Jacobi, Hamburg|St. James's]] (''St. Jacobi'') and [[St. Catherine's Church, Hamburg|St. Catherine's Church]] covered with copper plates, and of course the [[Heinrich-Hertz-Turm]], the once publicly accessible radio and television tower.

The many streams, rivers and canals in Hamburg are crossed by over 2300 bridges, more than [[Amsterdam]] or [[Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Hamburg &amp;ndash; Grüne Metropole am Wasser |url=http://www.hamburg.de/umwelt/wasser/150782/stadt-am-wasser.html |date=2007-07-01 |author=Staff |publisher=[[Government of Hamburg#Ministries|Behörde für Stadtentwicklung und Umwelt]] |location=Hamburg |accessdate=2008-09-24}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamburg has more bridges inside its city limits than any other city in the world. The [[Köhlbrandbrücke]], [[Freihafen Elbbrücken]], and Lombardsbrücke and Kennedybrücke dividing Binnenalster from Aussenalster are important roadways.

The [[Hamburg Rathaus|town hall]] is a richly decorated Neo-Renaissance building finished in 1897.
The tower is {{convert|112|m|0}} high.

Europe's largest inner-city development (as of 2008), the [[HafenCity]], will house about 10,000 inhabitants and 15,000 workers. The plan includes designs by [[Rem Koolhaas]] and [[Renzo Piano]]. The [[Elbe Philharmonic Hall]] ''(Elbphilharmonie)'', expected to be completed by mid-2012, will house concerts in a building on top of an old warehouse, designed by the Swiss firm ''[[Herzog &amp; de Meuron]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Staff |title=River Tunes: Elbe Philharmonic Hall by Herzog &amp; de Meuron |url=http://www.archnewsnow.com/features/Feature223.htm |date=2007-04-05 |accessdate=2008-08-23 |publisher=ArchNewsNow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Jaeger |first=Falk |title=Waterfront Living and Working: Hamburg's HafenCity |url=http://www.goethe.de/kue/arc/dos/dos/sls/en3356905.htm |publisher=[[Goethe-Institut]] |month=May |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-08-23 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080602083717/http://www.goethe.de/kue/arc/dos/dos/sls/en3356905.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate= 2008-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The many parks of Hamburg are distributed over the whole city, which makes Hamburg a very verdant city. The biggest parks are the ''Stadtpark'', the [[Ohlsdorf Cemetery]] and [[Planten un Blomen]]. The ''Stadtpark'', Hamburg's &quot;Central Park&quot;, has a great lawn and a huge water tower, which houses one of Europe's biggest [[planetarium|planetaria]]. The park and its buildings were designed by [[Fritz Schumacher (architect)|Fritz Schumacher]] in the 1910s.

===Parks and gardens===
The ''[[Alter Botanischer Garten Hamburg]]'' is a historic [[botanical garden]], located in the ''[[Planten un Blomen]]'' park, which now consists primarily of [[greenhouse]]s. The ''[[Botanischer Garten Hamburg]]'' is a modern [[botanical garden]] maintained by the [[University of Hamburg]].

==Culture and contemporary life==
Hamburg offers more than 40 theatres, 60 museums and 100 music venues and clubs. In 2005, more than 18 million people visited concerts, exhibitions, theatres, cinemas, museums, and cultural events. More than 8,552 taxable companies &amp;ndash; the average size was 3.16 employees &amp;ndash; were engaged in the culture sector, which includes music, performing arts and literature.

===Theatres===
[[File:Hamburg Deutsches Schauspielhaus 01 KMJ.jpg|thumb|''Deutsches Schauspielhaus'' in the quarter St. Georg.]]
[[File:Hh-hammoniabad.jpg|thumb|The ''English Theatre'']]

The state-owned ''[[Deutsches Schauspielhaus]]'', the [[Thalia Theatre (Hamburg)|Thalia Theatre]], &quot;Ohnsorg Theatre&quot;, &quot;Schmidts Tivoli&quot; and the ''Kampnagel'' are well-known theatres in Germany and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Kulturstiftung des Bundes |url=http://www.kulturstiftung-des-bundes.de/main.jsp?applicationID=203&amp;languageID=2&amp;articleID=3076 |title=Bayreuth Was Yesterday &amp;ndash; New Opera at Kampnagel |accessdate=2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The English Theatre of Hamburg]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.englishtheatre.de/ ''The English Theatre'' of Hamburg]&lt;/ref&gt; near U3 Mundsburg station was established in 1976 and is the oldest professional English-speaking theatre in Germany, and has exclusively English native-speaking actors in its company.

===Museums===
Hamburg possesses several big museums and galleries showing classical and contemporary art, as for example the [[Kunsthalle Hamburg]] with its contemporary art gallery (''Galerie der Gegenwart''), the Museum for Art and Industry (''[[Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg|Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe]]'') and the [[Deichtorhallen]]/House of Photography. The [[Internationales Maritimes Museum Hamburg]] opened in the HafenCity quarter in 2008. There are various specialised museums in Hamburg, such as the Museum of Labour (''Museum der Arbeit''), and several museums of local history, for example the Kiekeberg Open Air Museum (''Freilichtmuseum am [[Kiekeberg]]''). Two ''museum ships'' near Landungsbrücken bear witness to the freight ship (''[[Cap San Diego]]'') and cargo sailing ship era (''[[Rickmer Rickmers]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museen-in-hamburg.de/ |title=Museums in Hamburg |accessdate=December 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world's largest model railway museum [[Miniatur Wunderland]] with {{convert|12|km|2|abbr=on}} total railway length is also situated near Landungsbrücken in a former warehouse.

''BallinStadt Emigration City'' is dedicated to the millions of Europeans who emigrated from its mass accommodation halls to North and South America between 1850 and 1939. Visitors descending from those overseas emigrants may search for their ancestors at computer terminals.

===Music===
[[Hamburg State Opera]] is a leading opera company. Its orchestra is the [[Philharmoniker Hamburg]]. The city's other well-known orchestra is the [[North German Radio Symphony Orchestra]]. The main concert venue is the [[Laeiszhalle]], ''Musikhalle Hamburg'', pending completion of the new [[Elbe Philharmonic Hall]]. The Laeiszhalle also houses a third orchestra, the [[Hamburger Symphoniker]]. [[György Ligeti]] and [[Alfred Schnittke]] taught at the [[Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Transcript of the John Tusa Interview with Gyorgy Ligeti |author=Staff |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/johntusainterview/ligeti_transcript.shtml |year=1999 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2008-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Alfred Schnittke |author=Staff |url=http://www.boosey.com/pages/cr/composer/composer_main.asp?composerid=2731&amp;ttype=BIOGRAPHY&amp;ttitle=Biography/ |publisher=[[Boosey &amp; Hawkes]] |accessdate=2008-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the German premiere of ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' in 1985, there have always been [[musical theatre|musicals]] running in the city, including ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]'', ''[[Dirty Dancing#Stage version|Dirty Dancing]]'', and ''[[Dance of the Vampires]]''. This density, the highest in Germany, is partly due to the major musical production company ''[[Stage Entertainment]]'' being based in the city.

Hamburg is the birthplace of [[Johannes Brahms]], who spent his formative early years in the city. Hamburg was also the birthplace and home for famous waltz composer [[Oscar Fetrás]] who wrote the well-known &quot;Mondnacht auf der Alster&quot; waltz.

Prior to the group's initial recording and subsequent widespread fame, Hamburg provided residency and performing venues for [[The Beatles in Hamburg|The Beatles]] from 1960 to 1962. Hamburg has produced a number of pop musicians. Identical twin brothers [[Bill Kaulitz]] and Tom Kaulitz from the rock band [[Tokio Hotel]] live and maintain a recording studio in Hamburg, where they recorded their second and third albums, [[Zimmer 483]] and [[Humanoid]]. Singer [[Nena]] also lives in Hamburg. There are German hip hop acts, such as [[Fünf Sterne deluxe]], [[Samy Deluxe]], Beginner and [[Fettes Brot]]. There is a substantial [[alternative rock|alternative]] and [[punk rock|punk]] scene, which gathers around the [[Rote Flora]], a [[squatting|squatted]] former theatre located in the Sternschanze. Hamburg is famous for an original kind of German [[alternative rock|alternative music]] called ''[[Hamburger Schule]]'' (&quot;Hamburg School&quot;), a term used for bands like [[Tocotronic]], [[Blumfeld]], [[Tomte (band)|Tomte]] or [[Kante (band)|Kante]].

The city was a major centre for [[heavy metal music]] in the 1980s. [[Helloween]], [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]], [[Running Wild (band)|Running Wild]] and [[Grave Digger (band)|Grave Digger]] started in Hamburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=allmusic (((Helloween&gt; Biography ))) |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4471|pure_url=yes}} |first=Eduardo |last=Rivadavia |publisher=allmusic |accessdate=2008-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[industrial rock]] band [[KMFDM]] was also formed in Hamburg, initially as a performance art project. The influences of these and other bands from the area helped establish the subgenre of [[power metal]].

Hamburg has a vibrant psychedelic trance community, with record labels such as [[Spirit Zone Records|Spirit Zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Spirit Zone Recordings |author=Staff |url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Spirit+Zone+Recordings |publisher=www.discogs.com |accessdate=2008-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Festivals and regular events===
[[File:Hamburger Hafengeburtstag.jpg|thumb|left|annual [[Port of Hamburg]]-birthday]]
Hamburg is noted for several festivals and regular events. Some of them are street festivals, such as the [[gay pride]] ''[[Christopher Street Day]]'' festival&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Christopher Street day Hamburg |url=http://www.hamburg-pride.de/ |accessdate=2008-10-05}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Alster fair,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alstervergnügen Hamburg |url=http://www.alstervergnuegen.net/ |accessdate=2008-10-05}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; held at the ''[[Binnenalster]]''.

===Cuisine===
[[File:Scholle mit Speck.jpg|thumb|fried plaice [[Finkenwerder]] style]]
Original Hamburg dishes are ''[[Birnen, Bohnen und Speck]]'' ([[Northern Low Saxon dialect|Low Saxon]] ''Birn, Bohn un Speck'', green beans cooked with pears and bacon),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/07/05/43504.html |title=Birnen, Bohnen, Speck &amp;ndash; Schmeckt vorzüglich |date=2002-07-05 |accessdate=2008-08-11}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aalsuppe'' (Low Saxon ''Oolsupp'') is often mistaken to be German for “eel soup“ (''Aal''/''Ool'' translated ‘eel’), but the name probably comes from the Low Saxon ''allns'' {{IPA|[aˑlns]}}, meaning “all”, “everything and the kitchen sink”, not necessarily eel. Today eel is often included to meet the expectations of unsuspecting diners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/06/25/39651.html |title=Aalsuppe &amp;ndash; Frage des Geschmacks |date=2002-06-25|accessdate=2008-08-11}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is ''Bratkartoffeln'' (Low Saxon ''Brootkartüffeln'', pan-fried potato slices), ''Finkenwerder Scholle'' (Low Saxon ''Finkwarder Scholl'', pan-fried plaice), ''Pannfisch'' (pan-fried fish),&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/06/25/39713.html |title=Maischollen &amp;ndash; Zart gebraten |date=2002-06-25 |accessdate=2008-08-11}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rødgrød|Rote Grütze]]'' (Low Saxon ''Rode Grütt'', related to Danish ''rødgrød'', a type of summer pudding made mostly from berries and usually served with cream, like Danish ''rødgrød med fløde'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendbla |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/06/25/39656.html |title=Grütze &amp;ndash; Mit kalter Milch |date=2002-06-25 |accessdate=2008-08-11}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Labskaus]]'' (a mixture of corned beef, mashed potatoes and beetroot, a cousin of the Norwegian ''lapskaus'' and [[Liverpool]]'s [[Scouse (food)|lobscouse]], all offshoots off an old-time one-pot meal that used to be the main component of the common sailor's humdrum diet on the high seas).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/06/25/39664.html |title=Labskaus &amp;ndash; Essen der Matrosen |date=2002-06-25 |accessdate=2008-08-11}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Alsterwasser'' (a reference to the city's river Alster with its two lakes in the city centre created by impoundment) is the local name for a type of [[shandy]], a concoction of equal parts of beer and carbonated lemonade (''Zitronenlimonade''), the lemonade being added to the beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/08/01/52867.html |title=Alsterwasser &amp;ndash; Bier und Limonade |date=2002-08-10 |accessdate=2008-08-11}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is the curious regional dessert pastry called [[Franzbrötchen]]. Looking rather like a flattened croissant, the ''Franzbrötchen'' is somewhat similar in preparation but includes a cinnamon and sugar filling, often with raisins or brown sugar [[streusel]]. The name may also reflect to the roll's [[croissant]]-like appearance &amp;ndash; ''franz'' appears to be a shortening of ''französisch'', meaning &quot;French&quot;, which would make a ''Franzbrötchen'' a “French roll.”
Ordinary bread rolls tend to be oval-shaped and of the French bread variety. The local name is ''Rundstück'' (“round piece” rather than mainstream German ''Brötchen'', diminutive form of ''Brot'' “bread”),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/08/05/53895.html |title=Rundstück &amp;ndash; Hamburger Brötchen |date=2002-08-05 |accessdate=2008-06-06}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; a relative of Denmark's ''rundstykke''. In fact, while by no means identical, the cuisines of Hamburg and Denmark, especially of Copenhagen have a lot in common. This also includes a predilection for open-faced sandwiches of all sorts, especially topped with cold-smoked or pickled fish. The American [[hamburger]] seems to have developed from Hamburg's ''Frikadelle'': a pan-fried patty (usually larger and thicker than its American counterpart) made from a mixture of ground beef, soaked [[staling|stale bread]], egg, chopped onion, salt and pepper, usually served with potatoes and vegetables like any other piece of meat, not usually on a bun.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The Oxford Dictionary defined a ''Hamburger steak'' in 1802: a sometimes-smoked and -salted piece of meat, that, according to some sources, came from Hamburg to America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Stradley |first=Linda |title=History of Hamburgers |url=http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/HamburgerHistory.htm |year=2004 |accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
As is typical for Northern Germany, the original language of Hamburg is [[Low German]], usually referred to as ''Hamborger Platt'' (German ''Hamburger Platt'') or ''[[Hamburgisch|Hamborgsch]]''. Since large-scale Germanization beginning in earnest within the 18th century, various Low German-colored dialects have developed (contact-varieties of German on Low Saxon substrates). Originally, there was a range of such [[Missingsch]] varieties, the best-known being the low-prestige ones of the working classes and the somewhat more bourgeois ''Hanseatendeutsch'' (Hanseatic German), although the term is used in appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |contribution=Die deutsche Sprache—eine Dialektlandschaft |title=Nationalatlas Bundesrepublik Deutschland |last=Bausch |first=Karl-Heinz |contribution-url=http://www.ifl-nationalatlas.de/download/bsppdf/Band_6_bsp.pdf |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-09-24 |publisher=Leibniz-Institut für Länderkunde |location=Leipzig |isbn=3827409470 |pages=94–95}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these are now moribund due to the influences of Standard German used by education and media. However, the former importance of Low German is indicated by several songs, such as the famous [[sea shanty]] [[Hamborger Veermaster]], written in the 19th century when Low German was used more frequently.

Tourists play a significant role in the city's economy. In 2007, Hamburg attracted more than 3,985,105&amp;nbsp;visitors with 7,402,423&amp;nbsp;overnight stays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=[http://www.hamburg-tourism.de/ Hamburg Tourismus GmbH] |url=http://www.hamburg-tourism.de/fileadmin/files/B2B/Zahlen_und_Fakten/Tourismusmonitor/Newsletter/Newsletter_Nr18.pdf |format=PDF|title=Newsletter Nr. 18 |date=2008-02-29 |accessdate=2008-08-13}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tourism sector employs more than 175,000 people full-time and brings in [[revenue]] of €9.3 billion, making the tourism industry a major economic force in the Hamburg Metropolitan Region. Hamburg has one of the fastest-growing tourism industries in Germany. From 2001 to 2007, the overnight stays in the city increased by 55.2% (Berlin +52.7%, [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania]] +33%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher=[[Politics of Hamburg#Ministries|Behörde für Kultur, Sport und Medien]] |url=http://www.hamburg.de/daten-fakten/349180/aktuelles.html |title=Umsatzbringer und Jobmotor Tourismus |author=Staff |date=2008-07-11 |accessdate=2008-08-13}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical Hamburg visit includes a tour of the city hall and the grand church [[St. Michaelis Church, Hamburg|St. Michaelis]] (called the ''Michel''), and visiting the old warehouse district (''[[Speicherstadt]]'') and the [[Landungsbrücken|harbour promenade]] (''Landungsbrücken''). Sightseeing buses connect these points of interest. As Hamburg is one of the world's largest harbours many visitors take one of the harbour and/or canal boat tours (''Große Hafenrundfahrt'', ''Fleetfahrt'') which start from the ''Landungsbrücken''. Major destinations also include [[museum]]s.

Many visitors take a walk in the evening around the area of [[Reeperbahn]] in the quarter [[St. Pauli]], Europe's largest red light district{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} and home of strip clubs, brothels, bars and nightclubs. The singer and actor [[Hans Albers]] is strongly associated with St. Pauli, and wrote the neighbourhood's unofficial anthem, &quot;Auf der Reeperbahn Nachts um Halb Eins&quot; (&quot;On the Reeperbahn Half Past Midnight&quot;) in the 1940s. [[The Beatles]] had stints on the Reeperbahn early in their careers. Others prefer the laid-back neighbourhood ''Schanze'' with its street cafés, or a barbecue on one of the beaches along the river Elbe. Hamburg's famous zoo, the [[Tierpark Hagenbeck]], was founded in 1907 by [[Carl Hagenbeck]] as the first zoo with moated, barless enclosures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |publisher=[[National Audubon Society]] |work=Audubon Magazine |title=The New Zoo |url=http://audubonmagazine.org/features0111/newzoo.html |author=Rene S. Ebersole |month=November |year=2001 |accessdate=2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some visit Hamburg out of a specific interest, notably one of the musicals, a sports event, a trade show or convention. In 2005, the average visitor spent two nights in Hamburg.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The majority of visitors come from Germany. Most foreigners are European, especially from the [[United Kingdom]] (171,000 overnight stays), [[Switzerland]] (about 143,000 overnight stays) and [[Austria]] (about 137,000 overnight stays). The largest group from outside Europe comes from the [[United States]] (129,000 overnight stays).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Zahlen,Fakten,Trends 2007 |url=http://www.hamburg-tourism.de/fileadmin/files/B2B/Zahlen_und_Fakten/Studien_Publikationen/Zahlen-Fakten-Trends_2007.pdf |format=PDF |year=2008 |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburg Tourismus GmbH |accessdate=2008-09-24}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Gaßdorf: Engländer wollen in den Hafen, Amerikaner in gute Restaurants.

The cruise terminal is also a draw. The [[RMS Queen Mary 2|Queen Mary 2]] has docked in Hamburg regularly since 2004, and there are six departures planned from 2010 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;''Hamburg wird heimlicher Heimathafen der &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot; (in English: Hamburg nearly a home port for &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot;).''

Hamburg is a major transportation hub in Germany. Hamburg is connected to four [[Autobahn]]en (motorways) and is the most important railway junction on the route to Scandinavia.

Bridges and tunnels connect the northern and southern parts of the city, such as the [[Elbe Tunnel (1911)|old Elbe Tunnel]] (''Alter Elbtunnel'') now a major tourist sight, and the [[Elbe Tunnel (1975)|Elbe Tunnel]] (''Elbtunnel'') the crossing of a [[Bundesautobahn 7|motorway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/09/10/67509.html |title=Elbe ohne e &amp;ndash; Buchstaben fallen weg |date=2002-08-10 |accessdate=2008-08-11}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some airlines market [[Lübeck Airport]] in [[Lübeck]] as serving Hamburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Hamburg Lübeck Airport Guide |url=http://www.travel-library.com/airports/europe/Germany/hamburg/hamburg_lubeck_airport.html |author=Staff |publisher=www.travel-library.com |accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamburg's [[Vehicle registration plates of Germany|license plate]] prefix has been and is again &quot;HH&quot; (Hansestadt Hamburg, English: Hanseatic city of Hamburg) between 1906 and 1945 and again since 1956, rather than just the single-letter normally used for large cities since the federal registration reform in 1956, such as B for Berlin or M for Munich. The prefix &quot;H&quot; is used instead by [[Hanover]] since 1956. However, &quot;H&quot; was Hamburg's prefix in the years between 1945–1947.&lt;ref&gt;Other prefixes used between 1945 and 1956 were &quot;MGH&quot; (Military Government, Hamburg; 1945 only), &quot;HG&quot; (1947 only) and &quot;BH&quot; (British Zone, Hamburg) between 1948 and 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public transportation====
[[Public transport]] by rail, bus and ships is organized by a fare-collection joint venture between transportation companies. Tickets sold by one company in this ''[[Hamburger Verkehrsverbund]]'' (&quot;Hamburg transit authority&quot;) (HVV) are valid on all other HVV companies' services. The HVV was the first organization of this kind worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=HVV &amp;ndash; Mehr als ein Ziel &amp;ndash; Historie |url=http://www.hvv.de/ueber-uns/historie/ |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Verkehrsverbund |accessdate=2008-09-25}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Rail
Nine mass transit rail lines across the city are the backbone of Hamburg public transportation. The [[Hamburg S-Bahn]] (heavy railway system) system comprises six lines and the [[Hamburg U-Bahn]] three lines. ''U-Bahn'' is short for ''Untergrundbahn'' (underground railway). Approximately {{convert|41|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of {{convert|101|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of the subway is underground; most of the tracks are on embankments, viaducts or at ground level. Older residents still speak of the system as ''Hochbahn'' (elevated railway), also because the operating company of the subway is the ''[[Hamburger Hochbahn]]''. Another heavy railway system, the [[AKN Eisenbahn|AKN railway]], connects satellite towns in Schleswig-Holstein to the city. On certain routes, regional trains of Germany's major railway company [[Deutsche Bahn|Deutsche Bahn AG]] and the regional ''[[metronom Eisenbahngesellschaft|metronom]]'' trains may be used with a HVV public transport ticket, too. Except at the three bigger stations in the centre of Hamburg, such as [[Hamburg Hauptbahnhof|Hamburg central station]], [[Hamburg Dammtor station]], or [[Hamburg-Altona station]], the regional trains hardly stop inside the area of the city. The [[tram]] network was shut down in 1978.

;Bus
Gaps in the rail network are filled by more than 600 bus routes, plied by single-deck, two-, three- and four-axle diesel buses. Hamburg has no trams or trolley-buses, but has hydrogen-fueled buses operating pilot services. The buses run frequently during working hours, with some buses on some routes arriving as often as every 2 minutes. In suburban areas and on special weekday night lines the intervals can be 30 minutes or longer.

;Ferries
There are six ferry lines along the river Elbe, operated by the ''[[HADAG Seetouristik und Fährdienst|HADAG]]'' company. While mainly used by Hamburg citizens and dock workers, they can also be used for sightseeing tours.

;Aviation
The international airport at Hamburg Fuhlsbüttel, official name &quot;[[Hamburg Airport]]&quot; ([[International Air Transport Association|IATA]]: HAM, [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]]: EDDH) is the fifth biggest airport in Germany and the oldest airport in Germany, having been established in 1912. It is about 5 miles from the city centre. About 60 airlines provide service to 125 destination airports, including some long distance destinations like New York, Dubai, Toronto and Tehran. [[Lufthansa]] is the hub carrier, with the most flights, followed by [[Air Berlin]]. [[Lufthansa]] operates one of its biggest [[Lufthansa Technik|maintenance facilities]] at the Hamburg airport.

The second airport in Hamburg is Hamburg-Finkenwerder ([[International Air Transport Association|IATA]]: XFW, [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]]: EDHI). It is about 10&amp;nbsp;km from the city centre and is a nonpublic airport for the [[Airbus Operations GmbH|Airbus]] plant. It is the second biggest Airbus plant, after Toulouse, and the third biggest aviation manufacturing plant after Seattle and Toulouse. The Finkenwerder plant houses the final assembly lines for A318, A319, A321 and [[Airbus A380|A380]] aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Airbus in Germany |url=http://www.airbus.com/company/worldwide-presence/airbus-in-germany/ |author=Staff |publisher=Airbus |accessdate=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|In Hamburg it's hard to find a native Hamburger. A hurried and superficial search turns up only crayfish, people from Pinneberg, and those from Bergedorf. One accompanies the contented little kippers of a striving society; mackerels from Stade, sole from Finkenwerder, herrings from Cuxhaven swim in expectant throngs through the streets of my city and lobsters patrol the stock exchange with open claws.... The first so-called unguarded glance always lands on the bottom of the sea and falls into twilight of the aquarium. [[Heinrich Heine]] must have had the same experience when he tried, with his cultivated scorn and gifted melancholy, to find the people of Hamburg.|[[Siegfried Lenz]]||in ''Leute von Hamburg'' (People from Hamburg) ISBN 978-3-423-11538-4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Jennifer |last=Jenkins |title=Provincial modernity: local culture and liberal politics in fin-de-siècle Hamburg |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0801440254}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

}}
'''Helmut Josef Michael Kohl''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhɛlmuːt ˈkoːl}}; born 3 April 1930) is a [[Germans|German]] conservative politician and statesman. He was [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Chancellor of Germany]] from 1982 to 1998 (of West Germany between 1982 and 1990 and of the reunited Germany between 1990 and 1998) and the chairman of the [[Christian-Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) from 1973 to 1998. His 16-year tenure was the longest of any German chancellor since [[Otto von Bismarck]] and oversaw the end of the [[Cold War]] and the [[German reunification]]. Kohl is widely regarded as one of the main architects of the German reunification and, together with French President [[François Mitterrand]], the [[Maastricht Treaty]], which contributed to the creation of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chambers&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Mortimer | last=Chambers | title=The Western Experience }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kohl and Mitterrand were the joint recipients of the [[Karlspreis]] in 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;karlspreis&quot;/&gt; In 1998, Kohl was named [[Honorary Citizen of Europe]] by the [[European Council|European heads of state or government]] for his extraordinary work for European integration and cooperation, an honour previously only bestowed on [[Jean Monnet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eu-honorary&quot;/&gt; In 1996, he won the prestigious [[Prince of Asturias Award]] in International Cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundacionprincipedeasturias.org/ing/04/premiados/trayectorias/trayectoria667.html Helmut Kohl]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kohl has been described as &quot;the greatest European leader of the second half of the 20th century&quot; by former U.S. Presidents [[George H. W. Bush]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/europe/hero2006/kohl.html Time, ''Helmut Kohl'', by George H. W. Bush]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/europe/news/article_1639558.php/Clinton-praises-Germany-s-Kohl-at-Berlin-award M&amp;C news, &quot;Clinton praises Germany's Kohl at Berlin Award&quot;, by Deutsche Presse Agentur]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
===Youth===
Kohl was born in [[Ludwigshafen am Rhein]] (at the time part of [[Bavaria]], now in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]) [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], the third child of Cäcilie (''née'' Schnur; 1890–1979) and her husband Hans Kohl (1887–1975), a civil servant. His family was conservative and [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], and remained loyal to the [[Catholic Centre Party]] before and after 1933. His older brother died in the [[World War II|Second World War]] as a teenage soldier. In the last weeks of the war, Kohl was also drafted, but he was not involved in any combat.

Kohl attended the Ruprecht elementary school, and continued at the Max-Planck-Gymnasium. In 1946, he joined the recently founded [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]. In 1947, he was one of the co-founders of the [[Junge Union]]-branch in Ludwigshafen. After graduating in 1950, he began to study law in [[Frankfurt am Main]]. In 1951, he switched to the [[University of Heidelberg]] where he majored in [[History]] and [[Political Science]]. In 1953, he joined the board of the [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] branch of the CDU. In 1954, he became vice-chair of the Junge Union in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. In 1955, he returned to the board of the Rhineland-Palatinate branch of the CDU.

===Life before politics===
After graduating in 1956 he became fellow at the Alfred Weber Institute of the [[University of Heidelberg]] where he was an active member of the student society [[AIESEC]]. In 1958, he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate degree]] for his thesis &quot;The Political Developments in the Palatinate and the Reconstruction of Political Parties after 1945&quot;. After that, he entered business, first as an assistant to the director of a foundry in Ludwigshafen and, in 1959, as a manager for the Industrial Union for Chemistry in Ludwigshafen. In this year, he also became chair of the Ludwigshafen branch of the CDU. In the following year, he married [[Hannelore Kohl|Hannelore Renner]], whom he had known since 1948, and they had two sons.

=== Early political career===

In 1960, he was elected into the municipal council of Ludwigshafen where he served as leader of the CDU party until 1969. In 1963, he was also elected into the [[States of Germany|Landtag]] of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] and served as leader of the CDU party in that legislature. From 1966 until 1973, he served as the chair of the CDU, and he was also a member of the Federal CDU board. After his election as party-chair, he was named as the successor to Peter Altmeier, who was minister-president of Rhineland-Palatinate at the time. However, after the Landtag-election which followed, Altmeier remained minister-president.

===Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F028914-0002, Ludwigshafen, CDU-Kongress, Helmut Kohl.jpg|thumb|Helmut Kohl, 1969]]
On 19 May 1969, Kohl was elected minister-president of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], as the successor to [[Peter Altmeier]]. During his term as minister-president, Kohl founded the [[University of Kaiserslautern|University of Trier-Kaiserslautern]] and enacted territorial reform. Also in 1969, Kohl became the vice-chair of the federal CDU party.

In 1971, he was a candidate to become chairman of the federal CDU, but was not elected. Rainer Barzel remained in the position instead. In 1972, Barzel attempted to force a cabinet crisis in the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]/[[Freie Demokratische Partei|FDP]] government, which failed, leading him to step down. In 1973, Kohl succeeded him as federal chairman; he retained this position until 1998.

===The 1976 Bundestag election===

In the [[German federal election, 1976|1976 federal election]], Kohl was the CDU/CSU's candidate for chancellor.  The CDU/CSU coalition performed very well, winning 48.6% of the vote. However they were kept out of government by the centre-left cabinet formed by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] and [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)]], led by Social Democrat [[Helmut Schmidt]]. Kohl then retired as minister-president of Rhineland-Palatinate to become the leader of the CDU/CSU in the [[Bundestag]]. He was succeeded by Bernhard Vogel.

===Leader of the opposition===

In the [[German federal election, 1980|1980 federal elections]], Kohl had to play second fiddle, when CSU-leader [[Franz Josef Strauß]] became the CDU/CSU's candidate for chancellor. Strauß was also unable to defeat the SPD/FDP alliance. Unlike Kohl, Strauß did not want to continue as the leader of the CDU/CSU and remained Minister-President of [[Bavaria]]. Kohl remained as leader of the opposition, under the third Schmidt cabinet (1980&amp;ndash;82).

On 17 September 1982, a conflict of economic policy occurred between the governing SPD/FDP coalition partners. The FDP wanted to radically liberalise the labour market, while the SPD preferred to guarantee the employment of those who already had jobs. The FDP began talks with the CDU/CSU to form a new government.

==Chancellor of West Germany==
===Rise to power===
On 1 October 1982, the CDU proposed a [[constructive vote of no confidence]] which was supported by the FDP. The motion carried, and, on 4 October, the Bundestag voted in a [[Cabinet Kohl I|new CDU/CSU-FDP coalition cabinet]], with Kohl as the chancellor.  Many of the important details of the new coalition had been hammered out on 20 September, though minor details were reportedly still being hammered out as the vote took place.

Though Kohl's election was done according to the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]], some voices criticized the move as the FDP had fought its 1980 campaign on the side of the SPD and even placed Chancellor Schmidt on some of their campaign posters. Some voices went as far as denying that the new government had the support of a majority of the people. To answer this question, the new government aimed at new elections at the earliest possible date.

Since the Basic Law is restrictive on the dissolution of parliament, Kohl had to take another controversial move: he called for a confidence vote only a month after being sworn in, in which members of his coalition abstained. The ostensibly negative result for Kohl then allowed
[[President of Germany|President]] [[Karl Carstens]] to dissolve the Bundestag in January 1983.

The move was controversial as the coalition parties denied their votes to the same man they had elected Chancellor a month before and whom they wanted to re-elect after the parliamentary election. However, this step was condoned by the German [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] as a legal instrument and was again applied (by SPD Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] and his [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green]] allies) in 2005.

===The second cabinet===

In the [[German federal election, 1983|federal elections of March 1983]], Kohl won a smashing victory.  The CDU/CSU won 48.8%, while the FDP won 7.0%. Some opposition members of the Bundestag asked the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal constitutional court]] to declare the whole proceedings unconstitutional. It denied their claim.

The [[Cabinet Kohl II|second Kohl cabinet]] pushed through several controversial plans, including the stationing of [[NATO]] midrange missiles, against major opposition from the peace movement.

On 24 January 1984, Kohl spoke before the [[Israel]]i [[Knesset]], as the first Chancellor of the post-war generation. In his speech, he used Günter Gaus' famous sentence, that he had &quot;the mercy of a late birth&quot;.

On 22 September 1984 Kohl met the French president [[François Mitterrand]] at [[Verdun]], where the [[Battle of Verdun]] between France and Germany had taken place during
World War I. Together, they commemorated the deaths of both World Wars. The photograph, which depicted their minutes long handshake became an important symbol of French-German reconciliation. Kohl and Mitterrand developed a close political relationship, forming an important motor for [[European integration]]. Together, they laid the foundations for European projects, like [[Eurocorps]] and [[Arte]]. This French-German cooperation also was vital for important European projects, like the [[Treaty of Maastricht]] and the [[Euro]].

In 1985, Kohl and US President [[Ronald Reagan]], as part of a plan to observe the 40th anniversary of [[V-E Day]], saw an opportunity to demonstrate the strength of the friendship that existed between Germany and its former foe. During a November 1984 visit to the White House, Kohl appealed to Reagan to join him in symbolizing the reconciliation of their two countries at a German military cemetery. As Reagan visited Germany as part of the [[G8|G6]] conference in [[Bonn]], the pair visited [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] [[concentration camp]] on 5 May, and more controversially the German military cemetery in [[Bitburg]], discovered to hold 49 members of the [[Waffen-SS]] buried there.

In 1986, more controversy was caused by an essay published in the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' on 25 April 1986 entitled &quot;Land Without A History&quot; written by one of Kohl's advisors, the historian [[Michael Stürmer]], in which Stürmer argued that West Germany lacked a history to be proud of, and called for effort on the part of the government, historians and the media to build national pride in German history. Though Stürmer insisted that he was writing on behalf of himself and not in an official capacity as the Chancellor's advisor, many left-wing intellectuals claimed that Stürmer's essay also expressed Kohl's views.

===The third cabinet===
[[Image:ReaganBerlinWall.jpg|thumb|Chancellor Kohl behind and to the right of U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] (center) at the [[Brandenburg Gate]]. President Reagan, challenging [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] to &quot;[[tear down this wall]]!&quot; in 1987]]
After the [[German federal election, 1987|federal elections of 1987]] Kohl won a slightly reduced majority and formed his [[Cabinet Kohl III|third cabinet]].  The SPD's candidate for chancellor was the Minister-President of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Johannes Rau]].

In 1987, Kohl received [[East Germany|East German]] leader [[Erich Honecker]] - the first ever visit by an East German head of state to West Germany. This is generally seen as a sign that Kohl pursued ''[[Ostpolitik]]'', a policy of [[détente]] between East and West that had been begun by the SPD-led governments (and strongly opposed by Kohl's own CDU) during the 1970s. Following the breach of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989, Kohl's handling of the East German issue would become the turning point of his chancellorship.

===The road to reunification===
{{Main|German reunification}}
[[Image:Helmut Kohl in Krzyzowa.jpg|thumb|left|Helmut Kohl in [[Krzyżowa (Świdnica County)|Krzyżowa]] (Kreisau), Poland, 1989.]]
Taking advantage of the historic political changes occurring in East Germany, Kohl presented a ten point plan for &quot;Overcoming of the division of Germany and Europe&quot; without consulting his coalition partner, the FDP, or the Western Allies. In February 1990, he visited the Soviet Union seeking a guarantee from Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] that the USSR would allow German reunification to proceed. On 18 May 1990, he signed an economic and social union treaty with East Germany. Against the will of the [[Karl Otto Pöhl|president of the German federal bank]], he allowed a 1:1 exchange rate for wages, interest and rent between the [[German mark|West]] and [[East German mark|East Marks]]. In the end, this policy would seriously hurt companies in the [[new federal states]]. Together with Foreign Minister [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]], Kohl was able to resolve talks with the former Allies of World War II to allow [[German reunification]] and the expansion of the NATO into the former East German state. On 3 October 1990, the East German state was abolished and its territory reunified with West Germany. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Kohl confirmed that [[Historical Eastern Germany|historically German territories]] east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]] were definitively part of the [[Republic of Poland]], thereby finally ending the West German territorial claims. In 1993, Kohl confirmed, in a treaty with the Czech Republic, that Germany would no longer bring forward territorial claims as to the pre-1945 [[ethnic German]] so-called [[Sudetenland]]. This was a disappointment for the  German [[Heimatvertriebene]], displaced persons.

==Chancellor of reunified Germany==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-0916-021, Dresden, CDU-Wahlveranstaltung, Helmut Kohl.jpg|thumb|Helmut Kohl in 1990.]]
Reunification placed Kohl in a momentarily unassailable position.  In the [[German federal election, 1990|1990 elections]]{{ndash}} the first free, fair and democratic all-German elections since the [[Weimar Republic]] era{{ndash}} Kohl won by a landslide over opposition candidate and Minister-President of [[Saarland]], [[Oskar Lafontaine]]. He then formed his [[Cabinet Kohl IV|fourth cabinet]].

After the [[German federal election, 1994|federal elections of 1994]] Kohl was narrowly re-elected. He defeated the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate [[Rudolf Scharping]]. The SPD was however able to win a majority in the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]], which significantly limited Kohl's power. In foreign politics, Kohl was more successful, for instance getting [[Frankfurt am Main]] as the seat for the [[European Central Bank]]. In 1997, Kohl received the [[Vision for Europe Award]] for his efforts in the unification of Europe.

By the late 1990s, the aura surrounding Kohl had largely worn off amid rising unemployment. He was heavily defeated in the [[German federal election, 1998|1998 federal elections]] by the Minister-President of [[Lower Saxony]], [[Gerhard Schröder]].

==Retirement and legal troubles==

A [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|red]]-[[Alliance '90/The Greens|green]] coalition government led by Schröder replaced Kohl's government on 27 October 1998. He immediately resigned as CDU leader and largely retired from politics.  However, he remained a member of the Bundestag until he decided not to run for reelection in the [[German federal election, 2002|2002 election]].

===CDU finance affair===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=August 2010}}
{{Update|the extradition of Schreiber|type=section|date=August 2010}}
Kohl's life after political office in the beginning was dominated by the [[1999 CDU contributions scandal|CDU-party finance scandal]].

The party financing scandal became public in 1999, when it was discovered that the CDU had received and kept illegal donations during Kohl's leadership.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spiegel(08/07/2009)&quot;&gt;Gerd Langguth, &quot;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,640938,00.html The scandal that helped Merkel become chancellor]&quot;, ''[[Der Spiegel#Spiegel_Online|Spiegel Online]] International'', 8 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reference necessary|Investigations by the Bundestag into the sources of illegal CDU funds, mainly stored in Geneva bank accounts, revealed two sources. One was the sale of German tanks to [[Saudi Arabia]] (kickback question), while the other was the privatization fraud in collusion with the late French President [[François Mitterrand]] who wanted 2,550 unused allotments in the former East Germany for the then French owned [[Elf Aquitaine]]. In December 1994 the CDU majority in the Bundestag enacted a law that nullified all rights of the current owners. Over 300 million DM in illegal funds were discovered in accounts in the [[canton of Geneva]]. The fraudulently acquired allotments were then privatized as part of Elf Aquitaine and ended up with TotalFinaElf, now [[Total S.A.]], after amalgamation.|date=November 2009}}

{{Reference necessary|Kohl himself claimed that Elf Aquitaine had offered (and meanwhile made) a massive investment in East Germany's chemical industry together with the takeover of 2,000 gas stations in Germany which were formerly owned by national oil company [[Minol]]. Elf Aquitaine is supposed to have financed CDU illegally, as ordered by Mitterrand, as it was usual practice in African countries.|date=November 2009}}

{{Reference necessary|Kohl and other German and French politicians defended themselves that they were promoting reconciliation and cooperation between France and Germany for the sake of European integration and peace, and that they had no personal motives for accepting foreign party funding.|date=November 2009}}

{{Reference necessary|These scandal matters are still under investigation. The German-Canadian businessman [[Karlheinz Schreiber]], a longtime associate of Kohl's late CSU political rival Franz Josef Strauß, is wanted by Bavarian prosecutors on charges of fraud and corruption, but Schreiber has been fighting [[extradition]] from Canada to Germany for more than eight years, since the summer of 1999. Schreiber who is freed on bail in Canada as of April, 2008, filed an affidavit implicating former Canadian Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]], another business associate of his. The Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] called on 13 November 2007, for a [[Karlheinz Schreiber#Public inquiry|public inquiry]] to probe Schreiber's statements.|date=June 2011}}{{Relevance note|date=September 2011}}

In 2002, Kohl left the Bundestag and officially retired from politics. In recent years, Kohl has been largely rehabilitated by his party again. After taking office, [[Angela Merkel]] invited her former patron to the Chancellor's Office and Ronald Pofalla, the Secretary-General of the CDU, announced that the CDU will cooperate more closely with Kohl, &quot;to take advantage of the experience of this great statesman&quot;, as Pofalla put it. However, Kohl has retreated from public life to a far greater extent than his predecessor Helmut Schmidt.

On 5 July 2001, [[Hannelore Kohl]], his wife, committed suicide, after suffering from [[photodermatitis]] for years. On 4 March 2004, he published the first of his memoirs, called &quot;Memories 1930–1982&quot;, covering the period 1930 to 1982, when he became chancellor. The second part, published on 3 November 2005, included the first half of his chancellorship (from 1982 to 1990). On 28 December 2004, Kohl was air-lifted by the [[Sri Lanka]]n Air Force, after having been stranded in a hotel by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]].

He is a member of the [[Club of Madrid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cdm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clubmadrid.org/cmadrid/index.php?id=161 |title=Helmut Kohl |publisher=Club of Madrid |accessdate=2008-03-01 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071014222641/http://www.clubmadrid.org/cmadrid/index.php?id=161 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As reported in the German press, he also gave his name to the soon-to-be launched [[Helmut Kohl Centre for European Studies]] (currently 'Centre for European Studies'), which is the new political foundation of the [[European People's Party]].

In April 2008, Kohl was reported to be in intensive care due to a falling accident earlier in the year, and incapable of speaking.  Subsequent to his recovery, he married his 43-year-old partner, Maike Richter, on 8 May 2008.

In 2010, he had a gall bladder operation in Heidelberg.&lt;ref&gt;Bunte: http://www.bunte.de/newsline/helmut-kohl-altkanzler-uebersteht-operation-gut_aid_14807.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
In international politics Kohl was committed to [[European integration]], maintaining close relations with the French president [[François Mitterrand|Mitterrand]]. Parallel to this he was committed to [[German reunification]]. Although he continued the [[Ostpolitik]] of his social-democratic predecessor, Kohl also supported Reagan's more aggressive policies in order to weaken the [[USSR]].

==Public perception==

Kohl faced stiff opposition from the West German political left and was as well mocked upon for his provincial background, physical stature and simple language. Similar to historical French cartoons of [[Louis-Philippe of France]], [[Hans Traxler]] depicted Kohl as a ''pear'' in the left leaning satirical journal [[Titanic (magazine)|Titanic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taz.de/1/leben/kuenste/artikel/1/der-erfinder-der-%5Cbirne%5C/ Hans Traxler wird 80, Der Erfinder der &quot;Birne&quot;] (Hans Traxler 80, the inventor of the ''pear'') Taz 20.05.2009&lt;/ref&gt; The German expression ''Birne'' (&quot;[[pear]]&quot;) became a widespread nickname and symbol for the Chancellor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/883/312794/text/ Birne auf Breitwand, Dreharbeiten zu &quot;Helmut Kohl - Der Film&quot;] (The pear in Cinemascope - Shooting of ''Helmut Kohl - the film) Sueddeutsche Zeitung 05.10.2008, 15:40&lt;/ref&gt; Kohl became one of the most popular politicians in some regions of Eastern Germany and  a greatly respected European statesman.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

'''Horst Köhler''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhɔɐ̯st ˈkøːlɐ|pron|De-Horst Köhler.ogg}}; born 22 February 1943) is a German politician of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]]. He was [[President of Germany]] from 2004 to 2010. As the candidate of the two Christian Democratic sister parties, the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] and the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]], and the liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]], Köhler was [[German presidential election, 2004|elected]] to his first five-year term by the [[Bundesversammlung (Germany)|Federal Assembly]] on 23 May 2004 and was subsequently inaugurated on 1 July 2004. He was [[German presidential election, 2009|reelected]] to a second term on 23 May 2009. Just a year later, on 31 May 2010, he resigned from his office in a controversy over his comment on the role of the German [[Bundeswehr]] in light of a visit to the troops in [[Afghanistan]].

Köhler is an [[economics|economist]] by profession. Prior to his election as President, Köhler had a distinguished career in politics and the civil service and as a banking executive. He was President of the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] from 1998 to 2000 and head of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) from 2000 to 2004.

Because the office of President is less influential than that of the [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] and is mostly concerned with ceremonial matters, Köhler was a highly popular politician during his tenure. He has called for more influence for the President and has suggested the President should be directly elected (as was the case under Germany's [[Weimar Constitution]]).

== Early life ==
Köhler was born in [[Skierbieszów]] (then named Heidenstein), in the [[General Government]] area of [[German-occupied Poland]], as the seventh child of Elisabeth and Eduard Köhler, into a family of [[Bessarabia Germans|Bessarabian Germans]] from [[Rîşcani]] in [[Romania]]n [[Bessarabia]] (near [[Bălţi]], present-day [[Moldova]]). Horst Köhler's parents, ethnic Germans and Romanian citizens, had to leave their home in Bessarabia in 1940 during the [[Nazi-Soviet population transfers]] that followed the invasion of Poland and the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], which awarded Bessarabia to the [[Soviet Union]]. As part of the [[Generalplan Ost]], they were resettled in 1942 at [[Skierbieszów]], a village near [[Zamość]], [[Poland]] (then part of the [[General Government]]). As the [[Wehrmacht]] was pushed back and the first parts of Poland had to be abandoned in 1944, the Köhler family fled to [[Leipzig]]. In 1953, they left the [[German Democratic Republic|Soviet Zone]] – via [[West Berlin]] – to escape from the communist regime. The family lived in [[refugee camp]]s until 1957, when they settled in [[Ludwigsburg]]. Horst Köhler hence spent most of his first 14 years as a refugee.

==Studies and military service==
A teacher recommended that the refugee boy should apply for the [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]], and Köhler took his ''[[Abitur]]'' in 1963. After a two-year military service at a [[Panzergrenadier]] battalion in [[Ellwangen]], he left the [[Bundeswehr]] as  &quot;[[Leutnant]] der Reserve&quot; (reserve officer). He studied and finally earned a [[doctorate]] in [[economics]] and [[political science]]s from [[Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen]], where he was a scientific research assistant at the Institute for Applied Economic Research from 1969 to 1976.

==Career in the civil service==

Köhler joined the civil service in 1976, when he was employed in the [[Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Economics]]. In 1981, he was employed in the Chancellory of the state government in [[Schleswig-Holstein]] under Prime Minister [[Gerhard Stoltenberg]]. The following year, Köhler was made head of the Ministers office in the [[Federal Ministry of Finance (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Finance]], upon Stoltenberg's recommendation. He rose to head of department in 1987, with responsibility for financial policy and federal industrial interests. In 1989 he became head of the department for currency and credit.

==Secretary of State in the Ministry of Finance==
A member of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] since 1981, he was Secretary of State in the Federal Ministry of Finance from 1990 to 1993, and as such, the administrative head of the Ministry and the deputy of the Federal Minister of Finance ([[Theodor Waigel]]). In that capacity, he served as a &quot;[[Sherpa (G8)|sherpa]]&quot; (personal representative) for [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]], preparing  [[G7]] summits and other international economic conferences. He also served as the primary German negotiator in the [[Maastricht Treaty]] negotiations.

==Career in banking 1993–2000==

Between 1993 and 1998 he served as President of the association of savings banks in Germany, [[Deutscher Sparkassen- und Giroverband]]. In 1998 he was appointed president of the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]], and settled in [[London]], where the headquarters of the bank is located.

==Head of the International Monetary Fund==

[[File:Bono U2 with Horst Köhler at Prague 2000 IMF.jpeg|thumb|200px|Köhler as head of the IMF, discussing [[debt relief]] for [[Developing countries' debt|developing countries]] with the musician [[Bono]]]]
Köhler was appointed Managing Director and Chairman of the Executive Board of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) in 2000.  The government of [[Gerhard Schröder]] nominated him after their first nominee, [[Caio Koch-Weser]], was rejected by the United States.

He lived in [[Washington, D.C.]], from 2000 to 2004.

==President of Germany==
[[File:Václav Havel and Horst Köhler.jpg|175px|thumb|left|Horst Köhler and [[Vaclav Havel]], 2000]]

On 4 March 2004, Köhler resigned his post with the IMF after being nominated by Germany's conservative and liberal opposition parties as their presidential candidate. As these parties controlled a majority of votes in the ''[[Bundesversammlung (Germany)|Bundesversammlung]]'' (an electoral college consisting of the membership of the [[Bundestag]] and an equal number of delegates appointed by the legislatures of each [[States of Germany|state]]), the result of the vote amounted to essentially a foregone conclusion, but was closer than expected.  Köhler defeated [[Gesine Schwan]] on the first ballot by 604 votes to 580; 20 votes were cast for minor candidates, while one elector was absent because of a heart attack. Köhler succeeded [[Johannes Rau]] as President on 1 July 2004, for a five-year term.  Germany's presidency is a largely ceremonial office, but is also invested with considerable moral authority. From 2004 until early 2006, [[Charlottenburg Palace]] was the seat of the President of Germany, whilst [[Schloss Bellevue]] was being renovated.

Upon his election, Köhler, a conservative German [[patriotism|patriot]], said that &quot;Patriotism and being cosmopolitan are not opposites&quot;. &quot;He appeared an enlightened patriot who genuinely loves his country and is not afraid to say so&quot;, the newspaper ''[[Die Welt]]'' wrote. Presenting his visions for Germany, Köhler also said that &quot;Germany should become a land of ideas&quot;, and emphasized the importance of globalization, and that Germany would have to compete for its place in the 21st century. 

In July 2005, he suspended the Bundestag at Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]]'s request, after the latter had lost a motion of confidence in the Bundestag. This led to early election for the Bundestag in September 2005.

[[File:Horst Köhler in Brackenheim am 31. Januar 2009.jpg|thumb|Horst Köhler in [[Brackenheim]] after unveiling a bronze statue of [[Theodor Heuss]]]]
In October 2006, he made a far-reaching decision by vetoing the bill which would transfer Germany's Air Safety Administration [[Deutsche Flugsicherung]] into private ownership. The [[Bundestag]] passed this legislation but as President, Köhler was authorized not to sign it into law if, in his opinion, it contravenes the constitution. In December 2006 he did not sign the Consumer Information Law (which intended to make information collected by public food safety agencies available to consumers), because the constitution does not allow the federal government to instruct municipal authorities. This can only be done by the German states. There had only been six previous occasions when Germany's president had chosen to reject bills, in most instances less important legislation was involved. His vetoes were the first notable examples in recent German history.

In his 2007 Christmas address to the nation, Köhler urged the government to push ahead more quickly with reforms. He was also critical of the introduction of the [[minimum wage]] in the postal sector (which had led to the loss of 1000 jobs at [[Deutsche Post]] rival [[PIN Group]]), stating that &quot;a minimum wage that cannot be paid by competitive employers destroys jobs&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;German President criticises minimum wages&quot;&gt;Stuttgarter Zeitung, 29 December 2007 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May 2008, Köhler announced his candidacy for a second term as president. On 23 May 2009 he was re-elected by the [[Bundesversammlung (Germany)|Federal Assembly]],&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news   | title = German president wins re-election| publisher = BBC  | date = 23 May 2009  | url =  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8065167.stm | accessdate = 23 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was sworn into office for a second term on 1 July 2009.

===Resignation===
On 31 May 2010, Köhler announced his resignation as President of Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFP-Rücktritt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ivOge9ovvGl20_sawK1aa8afqXRw|title=Bundespräsident Köhler zurückgetreten|work=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]|date=31 May 2010|accessdate=31 May 2010|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came after German politicians criticised comments made by Köhler in relation to overseas military deployments:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/10198036.stm|title=German President Koehler quits amid row over military|date=31 May 2010|accessdate=31 May 2010|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|{{lang|de|&quot;Meine Einschätzung ist aber, dass insgesamt wir auf dem Wege sind, doch auch in der Breite der Gesellschaft zu verstehen, dass ein Land unserer Größe mit dieser Außenhandelsorientierung und damit auch Außenhandelsabhängigkeit auch wissen muss, dass im Zweifel, im Notfall auch militärischer Einsatz notwendig ist, um unsere Interessen zu wahren, zum Beispiel freie Handelswege, zum Beispiel ganze regionale Instabilitäten zu verhindern, die mit Sicherheit dann auch auf unsere Chancen zurückschlagen negativ durch Handel, Arbeitsplätze und Einkommen. Alles das soll diskutiert werden und ich glaube, wir sind auf einem nicht so schlechten Weg.&quot;}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;In my estimation, though, we—including [German] society as a whole—are coming to the general understanding that, given this [strong] focus and corresponding dependency on exports, a country of our size needs to be aware that where called for or in an emergency, military deployment, too, is necessary if we are to protect our interests such as ensuring free trade routes or preventing regional instabilities which are also certain to negatively impact our ability to safeguard trade, jobs and income. All of this should be discussed and I think the path we are on is not so bad.&quot;|Horst Köhler|Interview with [[Deutschlandradio]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ricke |first=Christopher |title=Sie leisten wirklich Großartiges unter schwierigsten Bedingungen |date=22 May 2010 |work=Deutschlandradio |url=http://www.dradio.de/dkultur/sendungen/interview/1188780/}}&lt;/ref&gt;|22 May 2010}}

After coming under criticism for his statements that Germany’s military missions abroad also served to secure trade, critics accused him of advocating the use of &quot;[[gunboat diplomacy]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5d856e60-6f3a-11df-9f43-00144feabdc0.html&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently stated that his comments referred to piracy off the coast of Somalia. Köhler stated that there was no substance to accusations that in the interview he had overstepped his formal role by favoring an unconstitutional position. After getting no substantial support in the dispute, Köhler stepped down on 31 May 2010, issuing a statement saying &quot;I declare my resignation from the Office of President, with immediate effect.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Controversy Over Afghanistan Remarks: German President Horst Köhler Resigns&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,697785,00.html|title=Controversy Over Afghanistan Remarks: German President Horst Köhler Resigns|date=31 May 2010|accessdate=31 May 2010|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resignation was considered a &quot;surprise&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704366504575278212516510890.html|title=German President Horst Köhler Steps Down|date=31 May 2010|accessdate=31 May 2010|publisher=The Wall Street Journal | first=Marcus | last=Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both pundits and opposition politicians labeled it &quot;an overreaction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,697794,00.html|title=Reaktionen zum Köhler-Rücktritt: 'Ich kann es kaum glauben'|date=31 May 2010|accessdate=31 May 2010|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tagesthemen.de/inland/koehlerruecktritt104.html|title=Der Bundespräsident im Porträt|date=31 May 2010|accessdate=31 May 2010|publisher=[[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following days he was criticized for not being able to handle criticism while being a rigorous critic himself. His unprecedented act of immediate resignation was also considered showing a lack of respect for his position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,697920,00.html|title=Pressestimmen zum Köhler-Rücktritt: Der 'Absteiger des Jahres' stürzt sich selbst|date=1 June 2010|accessdate=4 June 2010|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

As stipulated by the [[German constitution]], the powers of the vacant office were executed by the current President of the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]], [[Jens Böhrnsen]], until [[Christian Wulff]] was elected president on 30 June 2010 and resigned on 17 February 2012.

== Personal life ==
Horst Köhler is married to [[Eva Köhler]], a teacher.

'''Joachim Sauer''' (born April 19, 1949) is a German [[quantum chemistry|quantum chemist]], full professor at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. He is the husband of the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor of Germany]], [[Angela Merkel]].

== Scientific career ==
Sauer studied chemistry from [[1967]] to [[1972]] at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] and was awarded a [[doctorate]] in chemistry in 1974. He continued to do research there until 1977 when he joined the Academy of Sciences, Central Institute of Physical Chemistry in Berlin, one of the leading scientific institutes of the former [[East Germany|GDR]] ([[East Germany]]).

For a brief time during and after the [[German reunification]] (1990–1991) he was the Deputy Technical Director (Catalysis and Sorption) for BIOSYM Technologies, San Diego/USA (now [[Accelrys]]). He remained an advisor for BIOSYM until 2002.

In [[1992]] he joined the [[Max Planck Society]] as Head of the Quantum Chemistry Group in Berlin. Since 1993 he has been a full professor of Physical and Theoretical Chemistry at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. He is an active research scientist in quantum chemistry and computational chemistry.

== Personal life ==
From his previous marriage to a fellow chemist, Sauer has two sons, Daniel and Adrian.
On December 30, 1998, he married [[Angela Merkel]] (herself a doctor of physics who had once worked in quantum chemistry research), who later became chairperson of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] and on November 22, 2005, first female [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor of Germany]].

== Public visibility as husband of Angela Merkel ==
[[Image:Merkel-Bush-L.Bush-Sauer.jpg|thumb|Sauer (right) with [[Angela Merkel]], [[George W. Bush]] and [[Laura Bush]]]]
Due to the political career of his wife Sauer has gained far more public visibility than usual for a research scientist. On several occasions he said he is not fond of this publicity.

During the 2005 election campaign Joachim Sauer kept a very low profile, declining to give any interviews not related to his scientific work. After attending the [[Bayreuth Festival]] (an opera festival and a highly visible social event in Germany) with his wife, he was nicknamed &quot;the [[Phantom of the Opera]]&quot; by the German press.&lt;ref name=Phantom&gt;{{cite web | first=David | last=Crossland | title=Merkel's Phantom of the Opera | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,386384,00.html | publisher=[[Der_Spiegel#Spiegel_Online|Spiegel Online]] | date=2005-11-22 | accessdate=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. Sauer is known as a great lover of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner's]] music.

Even during his wife's election in the [[Bundestag]], her [[inauguration]], and later her taking the oath of office, Sauer was not present but reportedly briefly followed the event on TV from his university chemistry lab.&lt;ref name=QuantumLeap&gt;{{cite web | first=Craig | last=Whitlock | title=The Professor's Quantum Leap | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/07/AR2007060702139.html | publisher=[[The Washington Post]] | date=2007-06-08 | accessdate=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day Germany's biggest tabloid ''[[Bild-Zeitung]]'' displayed the headline &quot;Merkel - wo war ihr Mann?&quot; (&quot;Merkel - where was her husband?&quot;)

'''Jürgen Trittin''' (born 25 July 1954) is a [[Germany|German]] [[Bündnis 90/Die Grünen|Green]] politician. He was Federal [[Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (Germany)|Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety]] from 1998 to 2005 in Germany.

== Life and work ==

Trittin was born in [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]]. He earned a university degree in [[Social Economy]] in [[Göttingen]] and worked as journalist.

His political career started in 1982 as Secretary of the Alternative-Greens-Initiative List (AGIL) Group in the Göttingen City Council (until 1984). From 1984 to 1985, he worked as Press Spokesman for the Greens Group in the [[Lower Saxony]] State Assembly, which he joined in 1985 as member of the state parliament. 

From 1990 to 1994, Jürgen Trittin was the Lower Saxony Minister for Federal and [[European Union|European Affairs]] and the Head of the Lower Saxony State Mission to the Federal Government in a coalition cabinet with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]], led by then minister president of Lower Saxony [[Gerhard Schröder]] (SPD).

After Schröder's SPD won an absolute majority in the state elections in 1994, the coalition with the Greens was ended. Trittin now worked as Member of the [[Lower Saxony]] State Assembly and as Deputy Chairman of the [[Alliance 90/The Greens]] group in that parliament. In 1994, he became Spokesman (Chairman) of the national [[Green Party (Germany)|Green Party]]. 

In 1998, Trittin was elected as Member of the federal parliament ([[Bundestag]]). At the same time he discontinued his work as Spokesman, because party statutes do not allow concurrently being a member of parliament and a member of the party executive.

In the federal red-green coalition cabinet, he was appointed  Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, a role which he held from October 1998 until the Grand coalition took power in 2005. In this position he was responsible for the decision to abandon the use of [[nuclear power]] by 2020, called the [[nuclear power phase-out]] (see [[Nuclear power in Germany]]). 

In August 2005, he responded to a question on how best to react to the 2005 petrol prices crisis with &quot;leave the car at home from time to time.&quot; The media, in particular [[Bild-Zeitung|Bild]], attacked these comments.

At the time of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in August/September 2005, Trittin wrote an opinion piece in the newspaper [[Frankfurter Rundschau]] associating the U.S.'s failure to sign the [[Kyoto protocol]] with the hurricane and its devastation.

Trittin is single and father to one daughter.

==Criticism==
On Monday 12 September 2011, the Vice Chancellor, [[Philipp Rösler| Dr. Philipp Rösler]], after receiving some ''sensitive and classified'' information, wrote an article in the newspaper [[Die Welt]], explaining the possible benefits of a greek bankruptcy for the rest of the Eurozone member countries. Two days later, Jürgen Trittin, as well as a politician from the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)| F.D.P.]], [[Jorgo Chatzimarkakis]], being unaware of the information, asked the Chancellor [[Angela Merkel| Dr. Angela Dorothea Merkel]], to expel him from the government.

'''Philipp Rösler''' (born 24 February 1973&lt;ref group=&quot;fn&quot;&gt;His exact date of birth is unknown; 24 February 1973 is used in official documents&lt;/ref&gt;) is a Vietnamese-born [[Germany|German]] politician, who, since 2011, has been the [[Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (Germany)|Federal Minister of Economics and Technology]] and the [[Vice Chancellor of Germany]]. He is the Chairman of the liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (since 2011).

A physician by profession, he served as Minister for Economics and Deputy Prime Minister of the state of [[Lower Saxony]] February–October 2009. He was the [[Federal Ministry of Health (Germany)|Federal Minister of Health]] in the [[Merkel Cabinet II|second Merkel Cabinet]] from 2009 to 2011 and became [[Federal Minister of Economics and Technology (Germany)|Federal Minister of Economics and Technology]] in the cabinet in 2011. He is of [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] origin and was adopted by a German couple when he was still an infant.

==Life and career==
Philipp Rösler was born in [[Khanh Hung]], Ba Xuyen Province, in the former [[South Vietnam]] (now [[Soc Trang Province]], [[Vietnam]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bild.de/BILD/politik/2009/11/01/philipp-roesler-schwester-mary/besuch-im-waisenheim.html|date=2009-11-01|accessdate=2009-11-02|title=Erinnern Sie sich an diesen Waisenjungen, Schwester?|author=Von Jurgen Damsch|publisher=Bild}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;de&quot;&gt;[http://www.landtag-niedersachsen.de/Abgeordnete/abgeordnete.htm landtag-niedersachsen.de]&lt;/ref&gt; He was adopted from a Roman Catholic orphanage near [[Saigon]] (now [[Ho Chi Minh City]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,3998647,00.html|title=Our guest on 08.02.2009 Philipp Rösler, Politician and Doctor |publisher=Deusche Welle|date=2009-02-08|accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a [[German people|German]] couple that already had two biological children and then Rösler was brought to Germany at the age of nine months.&lt;ref name=&quot;de&quot;/&gt; He grew up in [[Hamburg]], [[Bückeburg]] and [[Hanover]], where he graduated from high school in 1992. After training to become a [[combat medic]] in the German [[Bundeswehr]] (the Federal Defense Force), Rösler was exempted to study medicine at the [[Hannover Medical School]]. Following this, he continued his education at the Bundeswehr hospital in Hamburg. He received his Dr. med degree in 2002 and left service as a [[Bundeswehr Joint Medical Service#Ranks of the Bundeswehr Joint Medical Service|Stabsarzt]] (a rank for German medical officers equivalent to an army captain)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cicero.de/97.php?item=3368 cicero.de] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.munzinger.de/search/portrait/Philipp+R%C3%B6sler/0/26206.html Biography at munzinger.de] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He is a Roman Catholic,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecumene.radiovaticana.org/ted/articolo.asp?c=476157&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of the General Conference of the [[Central Committee of German Catholics]]. He has been married to Wiebke Rösler, also a physician, since 2003. The couple have twin girls, Grietje and Gesche, born in 2008.

==Political career==
Rösler has been a member of the FDP and its political youth organisation, the Young Liberals, since 1992. He was secretary of the FDP in the state of [[Lower Saxony]] from 2000 until 2004 and has been chairman of the FDP parliamentary group in the [[Landtag of Lower Saxony|Lower Saxon state assembly]] since 2003.  From 2001 until 2006, Rösler was a member in the regional assembly of Hanover (district), where he was also deputy chairman of the parliamentary group. In May, 2005, he was elected an observer of the federal FDP executive committee. He received 95% of the votes, the best result of that party conference. At the state party conference in March, 2006, Rösler was elected as chairman of the Lower Saxon FDP with 96,4% of the votes; he succeeded Walter Hirche, who had decided to step down after twelve years at the helm. In April, 2008, Rösler was confirmed as the Lower Saxon FDP party chairman, receiving 95% of the votes.

At the federal party conference in June, 2007, Rösler was re-elected as a member of the party executive committee. The following month, he was elected to stand as his party’s main candidate in the [[Lower Saxony state election, 2008|Lower Saxon state election]] in January, 2008.  In that election, he received 10.9% of the votes in his local constituency, [[Hanover]]-Döhren. On February 18, 2008, Rösler was appointed minister for economy, labour and transport&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/blitzkarriere-an-der-leine;2120933 handelsblatt.com]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as deputy prime minister of the state of Lower Saxony.

In October 2009, Rösler succeeded [[Ulla Schmidt]] as [[Federal Ministry of Health (Germany)|Federal Minister of Health]] in [[Angela Merkel]]'s cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,657086,00.html Spiegel.de]&lt;/ref&gt;
Rösler succeeded [[Rainer Brüderle]] as Federal Minister of Economics and Technology on 12 May 2011 and [[Guido Westerwelle]] as Chairman of the FDP on 13 May 2011 and was also instated as [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany]] on 16 May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gessat|first=Michael|title=Vietnam-born doctor takes reins of German liberal party|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=May 13, 2011|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15073300,00.html|accessdate=May 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;appointment&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Philipp Rösler neuer Vizekanzler|publisher=[[German government]]|language=German|date=May 18, 2011|url=http://www.bundesregierung.de/nn_1264/Content/DE/Artikel/2011/05/2011-05-18-vizekanzler-roesler.html|accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rösler strongly supported the presidential candidacy of [[Joachim Gauck]], originally proposed by the SPD and Greens, and reportedly secured his nomination by convincing his coalition partner, the [[CDU/CSU]], to back the nomination.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/schwarz-gelb-nach-der-entscheidung-fuer-gauck-roesler-feiert-einen-gefaehrlichen-sieg-1.1288748&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Physical chemistry''' is the study of macroscopic, atomic, subatomic, and particulate phenomena in chemical systems in terms of physical laws and concepts.  It applies the principles, practices and concepts of [[physics]] such as [[Motion (physics)|motion]], [[energy]], [[force]], [[time]], [[thermodynamics]], [[quantum chemistry]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]].

Physical chemistry, in contrast to [[chemical physics]], is predominantly (but not always) a macroscopic or supra-molecular science, as the majority of the principles on which physical chemistry was founded, are concepts related to the bulk rather than on molecular/atomic structure alone. For example, [[chemical equilibrium]], and [[colloids]].

Some of the relationships that physical chemistry strives to resolve include the effects of:
#[[Intermolecular forces]] that act upon the physical properties of materials ([[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]], [[tensile strength]], [[surface tension]] in [[liquid]]s).
#[[Chemical kinetics|Reaction kinetics]] on the [[Reaction rate|rate of a reaction]].
#The identity of ions on the electrical conductivity of materials.
#[[Surface chemistry]] and [[electrochemistry]] of [[cell membrane|membranes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=v1oU13xAl6AC&amp;pg=RA1-PA134|page=134|title=Surface chemistry and electrochemistry of membranes|author=Torben Smith Sørensen|publisher=CRC Press|year=1999|isbn=0824719220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key concepts ==

The key concepts of physical chemistry are the ways in which pure physics is applied to chemical problems.

One of the key concept in chemistry is that all [[chemical species | chemical compounds]] can be described as groups of [[atoms]] [[chemical bond | bonded]] together and [[chemical reactions]] can be described as the making and breaking of those bonds. Predicting the properties of chemical compounds from a description of atoms and how they bond is one of the major goals of physical chemistry. To describe the atoms and bonds precisely, it is necessary to know both where the [[atomic nucleus | nuclei]] of the atoms are, and how electrons are distributed around them.&lt;ref name=Atkins249&gt;Atkins, Peter and Friedman, Ronald (2005). ''Molecular Quantum Mechanics'', p. 249. Oxford University Press, New York. ISBN 0199274983.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quantum chemistry]], a subfield of physical chemistry especially concerned with the application of [[quantum mechanics]] to chemical problems, provides tools to determine how strong and what shape bonds are,&lt;ref name=Atkins249 /&gt; how nuclei move, and how light can be absorbed or emitted by a chemical compound.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, Peter and Friedman, Ronald (2005). ''Molecular Quantum Mechanics'', p. 342. Oxford University Press, New York. ISBN 0199274983.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spectroscopy]] is the related sub-discipline of physical chemistry which is specifically concerned with the interaction of [[electromagnetic radiation]] with matter.

Another set of important questions in chemistry concerns what kind of reactions can happen spontaneously and which properties are possible for a given chemical mixture. This is studied in [[chemical thermodynamics]], which sets limits on quantities like how far a reaction can proceed, or how much energy can be converted into work in a [[combustion engine]] and which provides links between properties like the [[thermal expansion coefficient]] and change of rate in [[entropy]] with [[pressure]] for a [[gas]] or a [[liquid]].&lt;ref&gt;Landau, L. D. and Lifshitz, E. M. (1980). ''Statistical Physics'', 3rd Ed. p. 52. Elsevier Butterworth Heinemann, New York. ISBN 0750633727.&lt;/ref&gt; It can frequently be used to assess whether a reactor or engine design is feasible, or to check the validity of experimental data. To a limited extent, [[quasi-equilibrium]] and [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics | non-equilibrium]] thermodynamics can describe irreversible changes.&lt;ref name=Hill1&gt;Hill, Terrell L. (1986). ''Introduction to Statistical Thermodynamics'', p. 1. Dover Publications, New York. ISBN 0486652424.&lt;/ref&gt; However, classical thermodynamics is mostly concerned with systems in [[Thermodynamic equilibrium | equilibrium]] and [[Reversible process | reversible changes]] and not what actually does happen, or how fast, away from equilibrium.

Which reactions do occur and how fast is the subject of [[chemical kinetics]], another branch of physical chemistry. A key idea in chemical kinetics is that for [[reagent | reactants]] to react and form [[ Product (chemistry) | products]], most chemical species must go through [[Transition state | transition states]] which are higher in [[Thermodynamic free energy | energy]] than either the reactants or the products and serve as a barrier to reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Lanny D. (2005). ''The Engineering of Chemical Reactions'', 2nd Ed. p. 30. Oxford University Press, New York. ISBN 0195169255.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the higher the barrier, the slower the reaction. A second is that most chemical reactions occur as a sequence of [[elementary reaction | elementary reactions]],&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Lanny D. (2005). ''The Engineering of Chemical Reactions'', 2nd Ed. p. 25, 32. Oxford University Press, New York. ISBN 0195169255.&lt;/ref&gt; each with its own transition state. Key questions in kinetics include how the rate of reaction depends on temperature and on the concentrations of reactants and [[catalysts]] in the reaction mixture, as well as how catalysts and reaction conditions can be engineered to optimize the reaction rate.

The fact that how fast reactions occur can often be specified with just a few concentrations and a temperature, instead of needing to know all the positions and speeds of every molecule in a mixture, is a special case of another key concept in physical chemistry, which is that to the extent an engineer needs to know, everything going on in a mixture of [[Avogadro constant | millions of billions of billions]] of particles can often be described by just a few variables like pressure, temperature, and concentration. The precise reasons for this are described in [[statistical mechanics]],&lt;ref name=Chandler&gt;Chandler, David (1987). ''Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics'', p. 54. Oxford University Press, New York. ISBN 9780195042771.&lt;/ref&gt; a specialty within physical chemistry which is also shared with physics. Statistical mechanics also provides ways to predict the properties we see in everyday life from molecular properties without relying on empirical correlations based on chemical similarities.&lt;ref name=Hill1 /&gt;

{{See also|History of chemistry}}
[[File:Lomonosov Chymiae Physicae 1752.jpg|thumb|right|Fragment of M. Lomonosov's manuscript 'Physical Chemistry' (1752)]]
The term &quot;physical chemistry&quot; was coined by [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] in 1752, when he presented a lecture course entitled &quot;A Course in True Physical Chemistry&quot; (Russian: «Курс истинной физической химии») before the students of [[Petersburg University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YoE1wsA6USQC&amp;pg=PA388|page=388|title=Science in Russian culture|author=Alexander Vucinich|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1963|isbn=0804707383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern physical chemistry originated in the 1860s to 1880s with work on [[chemical thermodynamics]], [[electrolyte]]s in solutions, [[chemical kinetics]] and other subjects. One milestone was the publication in 1876 by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] of his paper, ''[[On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances]]''.  This paper introduced several of the cornerstones of physical chemistry, such as [[Gibbs free energy|Gibbs energy]], [[chemical potential]]s, [[Gibbs phase rule]].&lt;ref&gt;Josiah Willard Gibbs, 1876, &quot;[[On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances]]&quot;, ''Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Sciences''&lt;/ref&gt; Other milestones include the subsequent naming and accreditation of [[enthalpy]] to [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]] and to [[macromolecular]] processes. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The first [[scientific journal]] specifically in the field of physical chemistry was the German journal, ''[[Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie]]'', founded in 1887 by [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] and [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]]. Together with [[Svante August Arrhenius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Laidler|first = Keith|authorlink = Keith J. Laidler
| title = The World of Physical Chemistry|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1993| location = Oxford|pages = 48|isbn = 0198559194}}&lt;/ref&gt;  these were the leading figures in physical chemistry in the late 19th century and early 20th century. All three were awarded with the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] between 1901-1909.

Developments in the following decades include the application of [[statistical mechanics]] to chemical systems and work on [[colloid]]s and [[surface chemistry]], where [[Irving Langmuir]] made many contributions. Another important step was the development of [[quantum mechanics]] into [[quantum chemistry]] from the 1930s, where [[Linus Pauling]] was one of the leading names. Theoretical developments have gone hand in hand with developments in experimental methods, where the use of different forms of [[spectroscopy]], such as [[infrared spectroscopy]], [[microwave spectroscopy]], [[EPR spectroscopy]] and [[NMR spectroscopy]], is probably the most important 20th century development.

Further development in physical chemistry may be attributed to discoveries in [[nuclear chemistry]], especially in isotope separation (before and during World War II), more recent discoveries in [[astrochemistry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Herbst, Eric|title = Chemistry of Star-Forming Regions|journal = Journal of Physical Chemistry A|date = May 12, 2005|volume = 109|number = 18|pages = 4017–4029 | doi = 10.1021/jp050461c|pmid=16833724}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the development of calculation algorithms in field of &quot;additive physicochemical properties&quot; (practically all of physicochemical properties, as: boiling point, critical point, surface tension, vapor pressure etc. - more than 20 in all, can be precisely calculated from chemical structure, even if such chemical molecule is still non existent), and in this area is concentrated practical importance of contemporary physical chemistry.

The '''University of Leipzig''' ({{lang-de|Universität Leipzig}}), located in [[Leipzig]] in the [[Free State of Saxony]], [[Germany]], is one of the oldest [[University|universities]] in the world and the [[List_of_universities_in_Germany#Universities_by_years_of_existence|second-oldest]] university (by consecutive years of existence) in Germany. Famous alumni include [[Goethe]], [[Wagner]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Angela Merkel]] and multiple Nobel Prize winners in Physics, Chemistry and Literature.  

The university was founded on December 2, 1409 by [[Frederick I, Elector of Saxony]] and his brother [[William II, Margrave of Meissen]], and originally comprised four faculties. Since its inception the university has enjoyed over 600 years of uninterrupted teaching and research.

== History ==
{{refimprove|section|date=December 2011}}
=== Founding and development until 1900 ===
[[File:Uniriese.jpg|thumb|Former main building in front of MDR skyscraper.]]
The university was modelled on the [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]], from which the German-speaking faculty members withdrew to Leipzig after the [[Jan Hus]] crisis and the [[Decree of Kutná Hora]]. The ''Alma mater Lipsiensis'' opened in 1409, after it had been officially endorsed by [[Pope Alexander V]] in his ''[[Bull of Acknowledgment]]'' on (September 9 of that year). Its first rector was [[Johann von Münsterberg]]. From its foundation, the [[Paulinerkirche, Leipzig|Paulinerkirche]] served as the university church. After the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] the church and the monastery buildings were donated to the university in 1544.

During the first centuries the university grew slowly and was a rather regional institution. This changed, however, during the 19th century when the university became a world class institution of higher education and research. Until the beginning of the Second World War, the University of Leipzig attracted a number of renowned scholars and later [[Nobel Prize laureate]]s. Many of the university's alumni became important scientists.

During World War II, the university was kept open throughout the war even following the destruction of the university buildings. The acting rector, [[Erich Maschke]] during the war described the continuation of the university in a memo on May 11, 1945 announcing the vote for a new rector:
{{quote|Since 4 December 1943 a fixed determination not to abandon the University of Leipzig in the most difficult hour of its more than five-hundred-year history has bonded the professors with each other and with the students. The special task of repairing the damage caused by air attacks has now broadened out to the more general duty to save the continuity of our university and preserve its substance, at the very least its indestructible kernel, through the crisis that has now reached its fullest stage. After the destruction of most of the buildings and the majority of its libraries, this kernel is represented by the professoriate alone. This is what must be preserved as the great repository of value in the university.&lt;ref&gt;Universitätsarchiv Leipzig, Rectorate 50. Quoted in {{cite book|last=Grondin|first=Jean|title=Hans-Georg Gadamer: A Biography|year=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0300098413|pages=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== The University under the German Democratic Republic ===
By the end of World War II, 60 per cent of the university's buildings and 70 per cent of its books had been destroyed. The university reopened on 5 February 1946, but it was affected by the uniformity imposed on social institutions in the [[Soviet occupation zone]]. In 1948, the freely elected student council was disbanded and was replaced by [[Free German Youth]] members. The chairman of the Student Council, Wolfgang Natonek, and other members were arrested and imprisoned, but the university was also a nucleus of resistance. Thus began the Belter group, with flyers for free elections. The head of the group, [[Herbert Belter]], paid for his commitment to democracy with his life and was executed in 1951 in Moscow. The [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] was created in 1949 and in 1953 the University was renamed by its government the '''[[Karl Marx|Karl-Marx]]-University, Leipzig'''. In 1968, the partly damaged [[Augusteum (Leipzig)|Augusteum]], including Johanneum and Albertinum and the intact [[Paulinerkirche, Leipzig|Paulinerkirche]], were demolished to make way for a redevelopment of the university, carried out between 1973 and 1978. The dominant building of the university was the University Tower (now [[City-Hochhaus Leipzig]]), built between 1968 and 1972 in the form of an open book.

=== After the reunification ===
In 1991, the University was renamed again to its original name University of Leipzig (Alma mater lipsiensis). The reconstruction of the University Library, which was heavily damaged during the war and in the [[East Germany|GDR]] barely secured, was completed in 2002.
In 2008 the university was able to prevail in the nationwide &quot;Initiative of Excellence&quot; of Germany and it was granted the graduate school &quot;[[BuildMoNa]]: Leipzig School of Natural Sciences – Building with Molecules and Nano-objects&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buildmona.de Graduate School BuildMoNa]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the university was able to receive grants from the Saxon excellence initiative for the &quot;Life&quot; project – a project that tries to explore common diseases more effectively. Also in 2008 the [[Bach-Archiv Leipzig|&quot;Bach Archive&quot;]] was associated with the university.
With the delivery of the [[City-Hochhaus Leipzig|University Tower]] to a private user, the university was forced spread some faculties over several locations in the city. Furthermore it redesigned its historical centre at the [[Augustusplatz]]. This action was highly controversial. In 2002 Behet Bonzio received the second prize in the architectural competition. A first prize was not awarded by the jury. A lobby with partial support of the provincial government called for the rebuilding of [[Paulinerkirche, Leipzig|St. Paul's Church]] and [[Augusteum (Leipzig)|Augusteum]]. This caused the resistance of the university leadership, the majority of the students and population of Leipzig. These disputes led to a scandal in early 2003, were the Rector Volker Bigl, and the pro-rectors resigned in protest against the government. This was further forced after severe tensions had built up because of the Saxon university treaty on the future funding of higher education. As a compromise they could agree on the implementation of a second competition, which only covered the [[Augustusplatz]] front of the university. On 24 March 2004, a jury chose the design by Dutch architect [[Erick van Egeraat]], which was well received by almost all sides. He recalls the outer form of the St. Paul's Church and Augusteum, and abstracted the original building complex. The renovations began in the summer of 2005.
In 2009 the University of Leipzig celebrates its 600th anniversary with over 300 scientific and cultural lectures and exhibitions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sechshundert.de/index1_e.php?JavaScript=On Universität Leipzig 600th Anniversary]&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the role of the university's research and teaching from the beginning until today in Germany and Europe.

=== Library ===
[[Image:BibliothecaAlbertina Leipzig.jpg|University library Bibliotheca Albertina.|thumb]]
The [[Leipzig University Library|University Library of Leipzig]] was established in 1543. It is one of the oldest German university libraries and it serves as a source of literature and information for the University of Leipzig as well as the general public in the region. Its extensive historical and special collections are nationally and internationally recognized. The library consists of the main building &quot;Bibliotheca Albertina&quot; and forty branches situated near their respective academic institutions. The current stock comprises 5 million volumes and about 7,700 periodicals. Collections range from important medieval and modern manuscripts to incunabula, papyri, autographs, ostraka and coins. The [[Apel Codex]], a manuscript of 16th century music, is currently housed in the [[Leipzig University]] library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Grove Concise Dictionary of Music|first=Stanley|last=Sadie|first2=Alison|last2=Latham|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
The university's urban campus comprises several locations. All in all, the university is spread across 38 locations in Leipzig. The university's buildings in the center of Leipzig underwent substantial reconstruction since 2005; the new university's main building being drafted by Dutch architect [[Erick van Egeraat]]. The estimated total cost for the renovation project is 140 million euro. The new buildings are going to be completed in 2009/2010, just in time for the university's 600th anniversary celebrations.

Besides the faculties and other teaching institutions, there are several other bodies that serve the university: the University Library, a university archive and administration, numerous museums (e.g. the [[Museum of Musical Instruments of the University of Leipzig|Museum for Music Instruments]] and the Museum of Ancient Egypt) and the university hospital. The university's [[Leipzig Botanical Garden]] was established in 1542 and it is the second oldest botanical garden in Europe. 
The University's Musical Instrument Museum includes one of the world's three surviving [[piano]]s built by [[Bartolomeo Cristofori]], the piano's inventor. Five other Cristofori instruments are included in the Museum's collections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mfm.uni-leipzig.de/_eng/dasmuseum/europ_Musical_Instruments.php?navid=16 Museum of Musical Instruments]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academics===
Today, the university has 14 faculties. With over 29,000 students, it is Saxony's second-largest university. There are now more than 150 institutes and the university offers 190 study programs leading to [[Bachelor's degree]]s, [[Master's degree]]s, [[Staatsexamen]], [[Diplom]]&lt;ref&gt;Since the adoption of the Bachelor's degree and Master's degree only three study programs leading to Diplom have remained: Maths, Mathematical economics and Protestant [[Christian Theology]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.s]] of which nearly all are [[tuition]]-free. Arguably, the Faculty of Medicine is the university's most renowned faculty.

The university offers a number of courses in English and other foreign languages and there are several programs allowing foreign students to study abroad at the university. Current exchange partner universities include the [[University of Arizona]], [[University of Oklahoma]], [[University of Houston]], [[University of Alberta]], [[Ohio University]] and [[University of Edinburgh]] among others. Traditionally contacts to universities in Eastern Europe and the Far East are strong as well, e.g. there are cooperations with leading institutions like [[Lomonosov University]] (Moscow) and [[Renmin University]] (Beijing).

There is a variety of International Master's programs: American Studies, Global Studies, SEPT&lt;ref&gt;SEPT, the international Program of the University of Leipzig for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise promotion and training http://www.sept.uni-leipzig.de/&lt;/ref&gt; (MBA in SME Promotion)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sept.uni-leipzig.de/MBA-Program.10.0.html SEPT – MBA program at glance]&lt;/ref&gt; and one Bachelor/Master's/Ph.D. program (International Physics Studies Program&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~intphys/ Homepage of the International Physics Studies Program at Leipzig]&lt;/ref&gt;) taught in English.

Erasmus Mundus Global Studies on the other hand, is an interdisciplinary, research-based Master offered by a consortium of four European universities: University of Leipzig, the [[London School of Economics]], [[University of Vienna]], and [[University of Wroclaw]]. Since 2008 the university is also home to one of Germany's few [[Confucius Institute]]s. The Institute is based on an agreement of June 2006 between the university administration and representatives of the Chinese Embassy to establish a Confucius Institute in cooperation with the [[Renmin University of China|Renmin University]] and the &quot;National Office for Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language&quot;.

'''West Germany''' ({{lang-de|Westdeutschland}}) is the common [[English language|English]] name for the '''Federal Republic of Germany''' or '''FRG''' ({{lang-de|Bundesrepublik Deutschland}}) in the period between its creation in May 1949 to [[German reunification]] on 3 October 1990.  

During this period, West Germany and the communist [[East Germany]] were divided by the [[Inner German border]]. After 1961, [[West-Berlin]] was physically separated from [[East-Berlin]] as well as from East Germany by the [[Berlin Wall]]. This situation ended when East Germany was dissolved and its five states joined the ten states of the Federal Republic of Germany along with the reunified city-state of [[Berlin]]. The enlarged Federal Republic of Germany with sixteen states (known simply as &quot;Germany&quot;) is thus the continuation of the pre-1990 Federal Republic of Germany.

The Federal Republic of Germany was established from eleven [[states of Germany|states]] formed in the three [[Allied occupation of Germany|Allied Zones of occupation]] held by the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] (the &quot;Western Zones&quot;). The city of [[Bonn, Germany|Bonn]] was its provisional capital city. The fourth Allied occupation zone (the East Zone, or ''Ostzone'') was held by the [[Soviet Union]]. The parts of this zone lying east of the [[Oder]]-[[Neisse]] were in fact annexed by the Soviet Union and communist Poland; the remaining central part around Berlin became the communist [[German Democratic Republic]] (abbreviated GDR; in German ''Deutsche Demokratische Republik'' or ''DDR'') with its ''de facto'' capital in [[East Berlin]]. As a result, West Germany had a territory about half the size of the interwar democratic [[Weimar Republic]].

At the onset of the [[Cold War]], Germany (and, indeed, Europe) was divided among the Western and Eastern blocs. Germany was ''[[de facto]]'' divided into two countries and two special territories, the [[Saar (protectorate)|Saarland]] and divided Berlin. The Federal Republic of Germany claimed an [[exclusive mandate]] for all of Germany, considering itself to be the democratically reorganised continuation of the [[German Reich]]. It took the line that the GDR was an illegally constituted state. The GDR did hold regular elections, but these were not free and fair; from the West German perspective the GDR was thus a puppet state of the Soviets and therefore illegitimate. 

Three southwestern states of West Germany merged to form [[Baden-Württemberg]] in 1952, and the Saarland joined the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957. In addition to the resulting ten states, [[West Berlin]] was considered an unofficial ''de facto'' 11th state.  While legally not part of the Federal Republic of Germany, as Berlin was under the control of the [[Allied Control Council]], West Berlin aligned itself politically with West Germany and was directly or indirectly represented in its federal institutions.

Relations with the [[Soviet bloc]] improved during the era of ‘Neue [[Ostpolitik]]’ around 1970, and West Germany began taking the line of &quot;two German states within one German nation&quot;, but formally maintained the exclusive mandate. It recognised the GDR as a ''[[de facto]]'' government within a single German nation that in turn was represented ''[[de jure]]'' by the West German state alone. East Germany, as before, recognised the existence of two German countries ''de jure'', and the West as both ''de facto'' and ''de jure'' foreign country. The Federal Republic and the GDR agreed that neither of them could speak in the name of the other one.

The foundation for the influential position held by Germany today was laid during the ''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]'' (economic miracle) of the 1950s when West Germany rose from the enormous destruction wrought by [[World War II]] to become the world's third largest economy. The first chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]], who remained in office until 1963, had worked for a full alignment with the West rather than neutrality. He not only secured a membership in [[NATO]] but was also a proponent of agreements that developed into the present-day [[European Union]]. When the [[G8|G6/G8]] was established in 1975, there was no question whether the Federal Republic of Germany would be a member as well.

With the [[collapse of communism]] in Central and Eastern Europe in 1989, symbolised by the opening of the [[Berlin Wall]], there was a rapid move towards [[German reunification]]. East Germany voted to dissolve itself and accede to the Federal Republic in 1990. Its five post-war states (''Länder'') were reconstituted along with the reunited Berlin, which ended its special status and formed an additional ''Land''. They formally joined the Federal Republic on 3 October 1990, raising the number of states from 10 to 16, ending the division of Germany. The expanded Federal Republic retained West Germany's political culture and continued its existing memberships in international organisations, as well as its Western foreign policy alignment and affiliation to Western alliances like the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]].

==Naming conventions==
{{Main|BRD (Germany)}}
The official name of West Germany, adopted in 1949 and unchanged since, is ''Bundesrepublik Deutschland'' (Federal Republic of Germany). Its abbreviation &quot;BRD&quot; (German) or &quot;FRG&quot; (English) was sometimes also used.

In East Germany usage the terms ''Westdeutschland'' (West[ern] Germany) or ''westdeutsche Bundesrepublik'' (West German Federal Republic) were preferred during the 1950s and 1960s. This changed especially once East Germany considered West Germans and West Berliners foreigners under its [[Constitution of East Germany#1968 constitution|second constitution]] in 1968 abandoning the idea of a single German nation formerly upheld in East and West Germany alike. Starting in East German [[Neues Deutschland]] the initialism ''BRD'' (FRG) for the ''Federal Republic of Germany'' prevailed beginning in the early 1970s, while East German official sources adopted that initialism as the standard expression in 1973, followed by the usage of respective native abbreviations in all of the [[Eastern Bloc]].  

In reaction to this move, in 1965 the [[Minister of Intra-German Relations|Federal Minister of All-German Affairs]] issued the ''Directives for the appellation of Germany'' recommending avoiding the initialism. On 31 May 1974 the heads of German federal and state governments recommended to always use the full name in official publications. From then on West German sources began to avoid the abbreviated form, except left-leaning sources who started to embrace it. In November 1979 the federal government informed the [[Bundestag]] that the West German public broadcasters [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] and [[ZDF]] had agreed to refuse to use the initialism.&lt;ref&gt;See in general: Stefan Schmidt, &quot;Die Diskussion um den Gebrauch der Abkürzung «BRD»&quot;, in: ''Aktueller Begriff'', Deutscher Bundestag – Wissenschaftliche Dienste (ed.), No. 71/09 (4 September 2009) [https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/analysen/2009/abkuerzung_brd.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The different usages were so ingrained that one could deduce a person's or source's political leaning from the name used for West Germany. 

Meanwhile the colloquial term &quot;West Germany&quot; or its equivalents were used in many other languages. &quot;Westdeutschland&quot; was also a widespread colloquial form used in German-speaking countries, usually without political overtones.

==History==

{{Main|History of Germany since 1945}}

After [[World War II]], leaders from the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[Soviet Union]] held the [[Yalta Conference]] where future arrangements with post-war Europe and actions to be made against Japan in the Pacific were negotiated. The conference came to the agreement to split Germany into [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|four occupation zones]]—the [[France|French]] Zone in the far west, the [[United Kingdom|British]] Zone in the northwest, the [[United States|American]] Zone in the south, and the [[USSR|Soviet]] Zone in the east. It then was not the intention to split Germany, only to designate zones of administration.

Former German areas east of the rivers [[Oder]] and [[Lusatian Neisse|Neisse]] were put under Polish administration, and millions of Germans were expelled from there, to be replaced by Poles. (With the [[Soviet Union]] likewise taking a big bite from eastern Poland and [[East Prussia]]) In 1946–1949, the first three zones were combined in steps. First the British and American zones were combined into the quasi-state of [[Bizone|Bizonia]], then only months afterward the French zone was included into [[Bizone|Trizonia]]. At the same time, new federal states (''Länder'') were formed in the Allied zones, replacing the pre-war states. 

In 1949, with the continuation and aggravation of the Cold War (witness the [[Berlin Airlift]] of 1948–49), the two German states that were originated in the Western Allied and the Soviet Zones became known internationally as West Germany and East Germany. Commonly known in English as [[East Germany]], the former [[Soviet Occupation Zone]], became the ''[[German Democratic Republic]]'' or ''GDR''. From 3 October 1990, after the reformation of the GDR's ''Länder'', the East German states [[German reunification|joined the Federal Republic]].

===NATO membership===
&lt;!--[[File:ParisAgreement1954.jpg|thumb|left|The Paris Agreements, signed on 23 October 1954, restored sovereignty to the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] (FRG), which became a full member of [[NATO]], and resulted in the creation of the [[Western European Union]] (WEU).]]--&gt;
[[File:Deutschland Bundeslaender 1957.png|thumb|left|West Germany (blue) and West Berlin (yellow), after accession of the Saarland in 1957, before the five ''Länder'' from the GDR and East Berlin joined in 1990]]
The Federal Republic of Germany, founded on 23 May 1949, was declared &quot;fully sovereign&quot; on 5 May 1955. The former occupying Western troops remained on the ground, now as part of the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), which West Germany joined on 9 May 1955, promising to rearm itself soon.

West Germany became a focus of the [[Cold War]] with its juxtaposition to East Germany, a member of the subsequently founded [[Warsaw Pact]]. The former capital, [[Berlin]], had been divided into four sectors, with the Western Allies joining their sectors to form [[West Berlin]], while the Soviets held [[East Berlin]]. West Berlin was completely surrounded by East German territory and had suffered a Soviet blockade in 1948–1949, which was overcome by the [[Berlin airlift]].

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F002449-0027, Bonn, Bundestag, Pariser Verträge, Adenauer.jpg|left|thumb|[[Konrad Adenauer]] in parliament, 1955]]
The outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in June 1950 led to U.S. calls to rearm West Germany to help defend [[Western Europe]] from the perceived [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] threat. Germany's partners in the [[Coal and Steel Community]] proposed to establish a [[European Defence Community]] (EDC), with an integrated army, navy and air force, composed of the armed forces of its member states. The West German military would be subject to complete EDC control, but the other EDC member states ([[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Netherlands]]) would cooperate in the EDC while maintaining independent control of their own armed forces.

Though the EDC treaty was signed (May 1952), it never entered into force. France's [[Gaullists]] rejected it on the grounds that it threatened national sovereignty, and when the [[French National Assembly]] refused to ratify it (August 1954), the treaty died. The French Gaullists and communists had killed the French government's proposal. Other means then had to be found to allow West German rearmament. In response, at the [[London and Paris Conferences]], the [[Brussels Treaty]] was modified to include West Germany, and to form the [[Western European Union]] (WEU). West Germany was to be permitted to rearm (an idea many Germans rejected), and have full sovereign control of its military, called the [[Bundeswehr]]. The WEU, however, would regulate the size of the armed forces permitted to each of its member states. Also, the German constitution prohibited any military action, except in case of an external attack against Germany or its allies (''Bündnisfall''). Also, Germans could reject military service on grounds of conscience, and serve for civil purposes instead.

The three Western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] retained occupation powers in Berlin and certain responsibilities for Germany as a whole. Under the new arrangements, the Allies stationed troops within West Germany for NATO defense, pursuant to stationing and status-of-forces agreements. With the exception of 55,000 French troops, Allied forces were under NATO's joint defense command. (France withdrew from the collective military command structure of NATO in 1966.)

===Reunification===
{{Main|German reunification}}
The official German reunification ceremony on 3 October 1990 was held at the [[Reichstag building]], including [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]], [[President of Germany|President]] [[Richard von Weizsäcker]], former Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] and many others. One day later, the parliament of the united Germany would assemble in an act of symbolism in the Reichstag building.

However, at that time, the role of Berlin had not yet been decided upon. Only after a fierce debate, considered by many as one of the most memorable sessions of [[parliament]], the [[Bundestag]] concluded on 20 June 1991, with quite a slim majority, that both government and parliament should move to [[Berlin]] from [[Bonn]].

==West German economic miracle==
The West German [[Wirtschaftswunder]] (English: &quot;economic miracle&quot;, coined by ''[[The Times]]'' of London in 1950), was partly due to the economic aid provided by the United States and the [[Marshall Plan]], but mainly due to the currency reform of 1948, which replaced the [[Reichsmark]] with the [[Deutsche Mark]] as legal tender, halting rampant inflation. The Allied dismantling of the West German coal and steel industry finally ended in 1950.

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F038788-0006, Wolfsburg, VW Autowerk, Käfer.jpg|thumb|[[Volkswagen Beetle]] – for many years the most successful car in the world – on the assembly line in Wolfsburg factory, 1973]]
In addition to the physical obstacles that had to be overcome for the German economic recovery (see the [[Morgenthau Plan]]) there were also intellectual challenges. The Allies confiscated intellectual privileges of huge value, such as all German [[patent]]s, both in Germany and abroad, and used them to strengthen their own industrial competitiveness by licensing them to Allied companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econlib.org/library/enc/GermanEconomicMiracle.html David R. Henderson, &quot;German Economic 'Miracle'&quot;, ''The Library of Economics and Liberty'' website].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.germany.info/relaunch/culture/history/marshall.html Susan Stern, &quot;Marshall Plan 1947–1997: A German View&quot;, ''Germany Info'' website].&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile some of the best German researchers were being put to work in the Soviet Union and in the U.S.

Contrary to popular belief, the Marshall Plan, which was extended to include the newly formed West Germany in 1949, was not the main force behind the Wirtschaftswunder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econlib.org/library/enc/GermanEconomicMiracle.html Henderson, op. cit.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.germany.info/relaunch/culture/history/marshall.html Stern, op. cit.]&lt;/ref&gt; Had that been the case, other countries such as Great Britain and France (which both received higher economic assistance from the plan than Germany) should have experienced the same phenomenon. In fact, the amount of monetary aid (which was in the form of loans) received by Germany through the Marshall Plan was far overshadowed by the amount the Germans had to pay back as war reparations and by the charges the Allies exacted from the Germans for the ongoing cost of occupation (about [[United States dollar|$]]2.4 billion per year). In 1953 it was decided that Germany was to repay $1.1 billion of the aid it had received. The last repayment was made in June 1971.

The [[Korean war]] (1950–1953) led to a worldwide increased demand for goods, and the resulting shortage helped overcome lingering resistance to the purchase of German products. At the time Germany had a large pool of skilled and cheap labour, partly as a result of the [[deportation]]s and [[Human migration|migration]]s, which affected up to 16.5 million Germans. This helped Germany to more than double the value of its exports during the war. Apart from these factors, hard work and long hours at full capacity among the population and in the late 1950s and 1960s extra labour supplied by thousands of ''[[Gastarbeiter]]'' (&quot;guest workers&quot;) provided a vital base for the economic upturn. This would have implications later on for successive German governments as they tried to assimilate this group of workers.&lt;ref&gt;[[David H Childs]] and Jeffrey Johnson, West Germany: Politics And Society, Croom Helm, 1982 [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PJUOAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=West+Germany+-+politics+and+society&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ga1ab-mhef&amp;sig=SQ_14UMa9GfjbECQA7pXF0RSe_Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eO7uSouhMof6-Abkt8juCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 1950s onwards, West Germany had one of the strongest economies in the world, almost as strong as before the Second World War. The East German economy showed a certain growth, but not as much as in West Germany, partly because of continued reparations to the USSR in terms of resources.

In 1952 West Germany became part of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which would later evolve into the [[European Union]]. On 5 May 1955 West Germany was declared &quot;fully sovereign&quot;. The [[British Armed Forces|British]], [[Military of France|French]] and [[Military of the United States|U.S. militaries]] remained in the country, just as the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] remained in East Germany. Four days after becoming &quot;fully sovereign&quot; in 1955, West Germany joined NATO. The U.S. retained an especially strong presence in West Germany, acting as a deterrent in case of a Soviet invasion. In 1976 West Germany became one of the founding nations of the [[G8|Group of Six]] (G6). In 1973, West Germany—home to roughly 1.26% of the world's population—featured the world's [[List of regions by past GDP (PPP)|fourth largest GDP]] of 944 billion (5.9% of the world total). In 1987 the FRG held a 7.4% share of total world production.

==Position towards East Germany==
{{See also|German reunification}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F031406-0017, Erfurt, Treffen Willy Brandt mit Willi Stoph.jpg|thumb|[[Willy Brandt]] and [[Willi Stoph]] in [[Erfurt]] 1970, the first time a Chancellor met a GDR prime minister]]
The official position of West Germany concerning East Germany was that the West German government was the only democratically elected and therefore the only legitimate representative of the German people. According to the [[Hallstein Doctrine]], any country (with the exception of the USSR) that recognised the authorities of the [[German Democratic Republic]] would not have diplomatic relations with West Germany. 

In the early 1970s, Willy Brandt's policy of &quot;Neue [[Ostpolitik]]&quot; led to a form of mutual recognition between East and West Germany. The [[Treaty of Moscow (1970)|Treaty of Moscow]] (August 1970), the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1970)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (December 1970), the [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin]] (September 1971), the [[Transit Agreement (1972)|Transit Agreement]] (May 1972), and the [[Basic Treaty, 1972|Basic Treaty]] (December 1972) helped to normalise relations between East and West Germany and led to both German states joining the [[United Nations]]. The Hallstein Doctrine was abolished.

The West German Constitution (''Grundgesetz''/&quot;Basic Law&quot;) provided two articles for the unification with other parts of Germany:
* Article 23 provided the possibility for other parts of Germany to join the Federal Republic (under the constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany).
* Article 146 provided the possibility for unification of all parts of Germany under a new constitution.

After the peaceful revolution of 1989 in East Germany, the first freely elected East German parliament decided in June 1990 that the ''Länder'' soon to be reestablished would join the Federal Republic under Article 23 of the (West) German Basic Law (''Grundgesetz''). This made a quick unification possible. In July/August 1990 the East German parliament enacted a law for the reestablishment of ''[[New federal states|Länder]]'' on the territory of the German Democratic Republic.

The two German states entered into a [[Monetary union|currency]] and [[customs union]] in July 1990, and on 3 October 1990, the [[German Democratic Republic]] dissolved and the then reestablished [[New federal states|five East German ''Länder'']] (as well as a unified Berlin) joined the Federal Republic of Germany, bringing an end to the East-West divide.

==Politics==
Political life in West Germany was remarkably stable and orderly. The [[Konrad Adenauer|Adenauer]] era (1949–63) was followed by a brief period under [[Ludwig Erhard]] (1963–66) who, in turn, was replaced by [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]] (1966–69). All governments between 1949 and 1966 were formed by the united caucus of the [[Christian-Democratic Union]] (CDU) and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] (CSU), either alone or in coalition with the smaller [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP) or other rightwing parties.

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F038505-0006, Bonn, Amtsantritt Kabinett Brandt bei Heinemann.jpg|thumb|The Brandt cabinet of 1969 on the steps of President Heinemanns's residence in Bonn, [[Villa Hammerschmidt]]]]

Kiesinger's 1966–69 &quot;Grand Coalition&quot; was between West Germany's two largest parties, the CDU/CSU and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD). This was important for the introduction of new emergency acts—the Grand Coalition gave the ruling parties the two-thirds majority of votes required to see them in. These controversial acts allowed basic constitutional rights such as freedom of movement to be limited in case of a [[state of emergency]].

Leading up to the passing of the laws, there was fierce opposition to them, above all by the FDP, the rising [[German student movement]], a group calling itself [[Notstand der Demokratie]] (&quot;Democracy in a State of Emergency&quot;) and the [[Trade union|labour unions]]. Demonstrations and protests grew in number, and in 1967 the student [[Benno Ohnesorg]] was shot in the head by a policeman. The press, especially the [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] ''[[Bild-Zeitung]]'' newspaper, launched a vast campaign against the protesters and in 1968, believed by some as a result, there was an attempted assassination of one of the top members of the German socialist students' union, [[Rudi Dutschke]].

By 1958 a stronger desire to confront the [[Nazism|Nazi]] past had come into being. In the 1960s [[environmentalism]] and [[anti-nationalism]] became fundamental values among left-wing Germans. As a result in 1979 [[Alliance '90/The Greens|the Greens]] were able to reach the 5% minimum required to obtain parliamentary seats in the [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]] state election, and with the foundation of the national party in 1980 developed into one of the most politically successful green movements in the world.

Another result of the unrest in the 1960s was the founding of the [[Red Army Faction]] (RAF). The RAF was active from 1968, carrying out a succession of terrorist attacks in West Germany during the 1970s. Even in the 1990s, attacks were still being committed under the name ''RAF''. The last action took place in 1993, and in 1998 the group announced it was ceasing activities.

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F073617-0004, Mainz, CDU-Bundesparteitag, Kohl.jpg|thumb|[[Helmut Kohl]] in 1986]]

In the 1969 election, the SPD gained enough votes to form a coalition government with the FDP. SPD leader and Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] remained head of government until May 1974, when he resigned after the [[Guillaume Affair]], in which a senior member of his staff was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service, the [[Stasi]]. However the affair is widely considered to have been merely a trigger for Brandt's resignation, not a fundamental cause. Instead, Brandt, dogged by scandal relating to serial adultery, and struggling with alcohol and depression&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bwbs.de/Beitraege/130.html Talk by Hans-Jochen Vogel] on 21 October 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregor Schöllgen: ''Willy Brandt. Die Biographie.'' Propyläen, Berlin 2001. ISBN 3549071426&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the economic fallout of the [[1973 oil crisis]], almost seems simply to have had enough. As Brandt himself later said, &quot;I was exhausted, for reasons which had nothing to do with the process going on at the time.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;quoted in: Gregor Schöllgen. [http://www.zeit.de/2003/40/P-Schreiber?page=all ''Der Kanzler und sein Spion.''] In: DIE ZEIT 2003, Vol. 40, 25 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; 

Finance Minister Helmut Schmidt (SPD) then formed a government, continuing the SPD-FDP coalition. He served as Chancellor from 1974 to 1982. Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a leading FDP official, was Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister in the same years. Schmidt, a strong supporter of the [[European Community]] (EC) and the Atlantic alliance, emphasized his commitment to &quot;the political unification of Europe in partnership with the USA&quot;.

The goals of SPD and FDP however drifted apart in the late 1970s and early 1980s. On October 1, 1982, the FDP joined forces with the CDU/CSU to elect CDU Chairman [[Helmut Kohl]] as Chancellor in a [[Constructive vote of no confidence|Constructive Vote of No Confidence]]. Following national elections in March 1983, Kohl emerged in firm control of both the government and the CDU. The CDU/CSU fell just short of an absolute majority, because of the entry into the Bundestag of the Greens, who received 5.6% of the vote.

In January 1987, the Kohl-Genscher government was returned to office, but the FDP and the Greens gained at the expense of the larger parties. The Social Democrats concluded that not only were the Greens unlikely to form a coalition, but also that such a coalition would be far from a majority. Neither condition changed until 1998.

==Culture==
===Culture in general===
In many aspects, German culture continued in spite of the dictatorship and wartime. Old and new forms coexisted next to each other, and the American influence, already strong in the 1920s, grew.

===Sport===

[[File:Stamp football WC 1974 deutsche bundespost.jpg|thumb|Postage stamps commemorating football's [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]] in West Germany]]
In the 20th century [[association football]] became the largest sport in Germany. The [[Germany national football team]], established in 1900, continued its tradition based in the Federal Republic of Germany, winning the [[1954 FIFA World Cup]] in a stunning upset dubbed the [[1954 FIFA World Cup Final|miracle of Bern]]. Earlier, the German team was not considered part of the international top. The [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] was held in West German cities and West Berlin. After having been beaten by their East German counterparts in the first round, the team of the [[German Football Association]] won the cup again, defeating the [[Netherlands]] 2–1 in the final. With the process of unification in full swing in the summer of 1990, the Germans won a third World Cup, with players that had been capped for East Germany not yet permitted to contribute. European championships have been won too, in 1972 and 1980. 

After both Olympic Games of 1936 had been held in Germany, [[Munich]] was selected to host the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]. These were also the first summer games in which the East Germans showed up with the separate flag and anthem of the GDR. Since the 1950s, [[Germany at the Olympics]] had been represented by a united team led by the pre-war German NOC officials as the IOC had denied East German demands for a separate team.

As in 1957, when the Saarland acceded, East German sport organisations ceased to exist in late 1990 as their subdivisions and their members joined their Western counterparts. Thus, the present German organisations and teams in football, Olympics and elsewhere are identical to those that had been informally called &quot;West German&quot; before 1991. The only differences were a larger membership and a different name used by some foreigners. These organisations and teams in turn mostly continued the traditions of those that represented Germany before the Second World War, and even the First World War, thus providing a century-old continuity despite political changes. On the other hand, the separate East German teams and organisations were founded in the 1950s; they were an episode lasting less than four decades, yet quite successful in that time.

===Literary scene===
Besides the interest in the older generation of writers, new authors emerged on the background of the experiences of war and after war period. [[Wolfgang Borchert]], a former soldier who died young in 1947, is one of the best known representants of the [[Trümmerliteratur]]. [[Heinrich Böll]] is considered an observer of the young Federal Republic from the 1950s to the 1970s, and caused some political controversies because of his increasingly critical view on society.

===Life in general===
[[File:Franz Skarbina Weihnachtsmarkt Berlin.jpg|thumb|Franz Skarbina: Weihnachtsmarkt in Berlin, 1892]]
During the 40 years of separation some divergence occurred in the cultural life of the two parts of the severed nation. Both West Germany and East Germany followed along traditional paths of the common German culture, but West Germany, being obviously more affected by influences from western Europe and [[North America]], became more [[Multiculturalism|cosmopolitan]]. Conversely, East Germany, while remaining more conservative than West Germany in its adherence to some aspects of the received tradition, was strongly moulded by the dictates of a [[state socialism|state socialist]] ideology of predominantly Soviet inspiration. On the non-political level, East Germany was also influenced by the Eastern Bloc's Slavic cultures that manifested in art, culinary scene, and sports. Nevertheless, young East Germans were also fascinated by Western and particularly American culture, which they had a degree of access to in a variety of ways, not least through West German television and radio, whose broadcasts reached many parts of the country.

For the majority of Germans in present-day Germany who lived in pre-reunification West Germany, there has been minimal change in daily life stemming from German reunification as the reunified country is essentially West Germany incorporating East Germany on a West German base. In contrast, for East Germans the scale of change has been sweeping in all aspects of life from that before ''[[die Wende]]''. Although movements like [[Ostalgia]] exist attempting to celebrate and preserve parts of the GDR culture, since reunification the former East Germany has been converging towards the western part of the country in most parts of daily life.

==Geographical distribution of government==
In West Germany, most of the political agencies and buildings were located in Bonn, while the [[DAX|German Stock Market]] was located in [[Frankfurt am Main]], which became the economic center. The judicial branch of both the German [[Federal Constitutional Court]] (Bundesverfassungsgericht) and the highest Court of Appeals, were located in [[Karlsruhe]].

The West German government was known to be much more [[Decentralization|decentralised]] than its [[state socialism|state socialist]] East German counterpart, the former being a [[federal state]] and the latter a [[Unitary state|unitary one]]. Whilst East Germany was divided into 15 administrative districts (''Bezirke''), which were merely local branches of the national government, West Germany was divided into states (''Länder'') with independently elected state parliaments and control of the [[Bundesrat]], the second legislative chamber of the Federal Government.

==Present geographical and political terminology==
Today, [[Northrhine-Westphalia]] is often considered to be [[western Germany]] in geographical terms. When distinguishing between former West Germany and former East Germany as parts of present-day unified Germany, it has become most common to refer to the ''Alte Bundesländer'' (old states) and the ''Neue Bundesländer'' (new states), although ''Westdeutschland'' and ''Ostdeutschland'' are still heard as well.

'''Achille Peretti''' (13 June 1911 &amp;ndash; 14 April 1983), was a [[France|French]] [[politician]].

Peretti was born in [[Ajaccio]]. A lawyer by profession, he was a member of the French resistance, and was in charge of security of [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s government in [[Algiers]].

After the war, Peretti pursued a business career. A member of the French parliament from 1958 to his death, he became chairman of the National Assembly in 1969 when [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]] was nominated as prime minister. After the right-wing coalition's narrow victory in the 1973 elections, he had to step down and was replaced by [[Edgar Faure]].

Peretti was the mayor of [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] from 1947 until his death. He was succeeded by [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] who had become his political protégé.

She has been married to [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], the [[President of France|President of the French Republic]], since February 2008; the couple has a daughter, Giulia, born in October 2011.

==Early life==
Carla Gilberta Bruni Tedeschi was born in [[Turin]], Italy, and is [[Beneficiary|heiress]] to the fortune created by the Italian tyre manufacturing company [[CEAT Limited|CEAT]], founded in the 1920s by her grandfather Virginio Bruni Tedeschi. The company was sold in the 1970s to [[Pirelli]] (the brand lives on via its former subsidiary in India, founded in 1958).&lt;ref name=&quot;liberation&quot;&gt;{{fr icon}} {{cite web

 |title=Bruni-Tedeschi, de la saga à la telenovela |work=Libération |language=French |date=4 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to France in 1975,&lt;ref name=&quot;vanity fair 2008&quot;/&gt; reportedly to escape the threat of kidnapping by the [[Red Brigades]], a [[Marxist-Leninist]] Revolutionary group active in Italy in the 1970s. Bruni grew up in France from age seven and attended boarding school in Switzerland. She went to Paris to study art and architecture, but left school at 19 to become a model.&lt;ref name=&quot;thefashioninsider&quot;/&gt;

She is legally the daughter of Italian [[concert pianist]] [[:fr:Marisa Borini|Marisa Borini]] and [[industrialist]] and [[classical composer]] [[:fr:Alberto Bruni Tedeschi|Alberto Bruni Tedeschi]]. However, in 2008 Bruni told ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' that her biological father is Italian-born, [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] grocery magnate Maurizio Remmert, a young classical guitarist who had a six-year affair with her mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanity fair 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/style/features/2008/09/bruni200809

She had a brother, Virginio Bruni Tedeschi (1959–4 July 2006), who died from complications of HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=&quot;virginio&quot;&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/3539784/Carla-Bruni-became-aids-ambassador-because-brother-died-from-disease.html Carla Bruni became Aids ambassador because brother died from disease] – ''Telegraph'', 1 Dec 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

From her biological father, she has a half-sister, Consuelo Remmert.&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [http://www.repubblica.it/2007/10/sezioni/persone/sarkozy-separazione/padre-carla/padre-carla.html Il padre naturale di Carla Bruni « Vi racconto il legame con mia figlia »] – ''[[La Repubblica]]'', 9 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1987–1996: early career and modeling===
Bruni signed with City Models at age 19.&lt;ref name=&quot;thefashioninsider&quot;/&gt; [[Paul Marciano]], president and creative director of [[Guess (clothing)|Guess?

Following months of speculation, in a television interview broadcast on 23 November 2009, Bruni revealed that she had accepted a role in a forthcoming [[Woody Allen]] film. She admitted her reasoning for embarking on the Paris production;  &quot;I'm not an actress at all. Perhaps I'll be completely hopeless but I can't miss an opportunity like this one. When I'm a grandmother I'd like to be able to say I made a film with Woody Allen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/nov/24/carla-bruni-woody-allen-film Carla Bruni accepts Woody Allen film proposal] The Guardian. 24 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/6653591/Johnny-Hallyday-following-Carla-Bruni-into-films.html Johnny Hallyday following Carla Bruni into films] The Telegraph. 25 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The film, ''[[Midnight in Paris]]'', was released in 2011; Bruni appeared as a guide at the [[Musée Rodin]], who discusses sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]] with the leading characters.

In September 2010, she contributed a cover of [[David Bowie]]'s &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; to the [[War Child (charity)|War Child]] charity record [[We Were So Turned On]] : a tribute to David Bowie ([[Manimal Vinyl]]). They also released the track as a split 7&quot; vinyl split with UK legends, [[Duran Duran]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://musiconvinyl.blogspot.com/2011/02/boys-keep-swinging-duran-duran-absolute.html Boys keep swinging – Duran Duran / Absolute beginners – Carla Bruni] – Music On Vinyl, 16 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian singer/songwriter [[Simone Cristicchi]]’s entry in the 2010 [[Festival della canzone italiana|San Remo Italian Song Festival]] was the song “Meno Male”, with the chorus lyrics of “Meno male che c’è Carla Bruni” (“Thank goodness for Carla Bruni”). The song supposedly mocks Bruni and her husband, but Cristicchi stated in an interview for Italian television weekly [[TV Sorrisi e Canzoni]] that the song is about “our way of being Italian, [we are] always ready to follow any type of gossip and are disinterested in real problems”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sorrisi.com/2010/02/10/simone-cristicchi-secondo-me-son-tutti-matti/ Simone Cristicchi – Secondo me son tutti matti] TV Sorrisi e Canzoni. 10 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Bruni was to be a guest singer at the 2010 San Remo festival but withdrew from participating, purportedly because she was offended by Cristicchi’s song.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/7136849/Carla-Bruni-withdraws-from-festival-over-Sarkozy-song.html Carla Bruni withdraws from festival 'over Sarkozy song'] The Telegraph. 2 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
=== Marriage to Nicolas Sarkozy ===
[[File:Michelle obama and carla bruni sarkozy.jpg|left|thumb|Carla Bruni with [[Michelle Obama]]]]
Bruni met the recently divorced French president Nicolas Sarkozy in November 2007 at a dinner party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jan/13/france.alexduvalsmith France begins to grow weary with the Sarkozy soap opera] – [[The Guardian]], 13 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief romance they married on 2 February 2008 at the [[Élysée Palace]] in Paris. The marriage is Bruni's first and Sarkozy's third.  Bruni obtained French nationality not long afterwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lefigaro&quot;/&gt; She has since made contradictory statements as to whether she still holds Italian nationality as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marianne2.fr/Carla-Bruni-Sarkozy-son-pays,-elle-l-aime-mais-elle-le-quitte!_a174453.html Carla Bruni Sarkozy: son pays, elle l'aime... mais elle le quitte!] – [[Marianne (magazine)|Marianne]] 17 January 2009 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following her marriage to Sarkozy, in February 2008, Bruni continued accompanying him on state visits, including to the United Kingdom in March 2008, which created a sensation in the international press and the public in the UK and France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/7316345.stm BBC News In Pictures – Carla Bruni-Sarkozy] – [[BBC News]], 27 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; She has an office and staff at her disposal in the East wing of the [[Élysée Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualites/2008/04/03/01001-20080403ARTFIG00405-confidentiel-carla-prend-ses-quartiers-a-l-elysee.php Confidentiel : Carla prend ses quartiers à l'Élysée] – [[Le Figaro]], 3 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

There was controversy on the eve of the state visit to the UK, with the publication by Christie's auction house of a nude photograph of Bruni taken during her career as a model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-544832/Think-THIS-image-Carla-racy-You-ones-I-didnt-publish-says-photographer.html ''Think THIS image of Carla is racy?

The couple was awarded damages by a French court&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1577810/Carla-Bruni-awarded-damages-from-Ryanair.html ''Carla Bruni awarded damages from Ryanair''] – Telegraph, 7 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; which they donated to ''[[Restaurants du Cœur|Les Restos du Cœur]]'', an organisation which provides meals to the homeless.

In December 2008, Bruni sued the makers of a bag featuring a nude shot of the French first lady taken during her supermodelling youth. Clothes designer Pardon has produced 10,000 of the shopping bags emblazoned with the nude photo taken in 1993, showing Bruni staring at the camera with her crossed hands covering her crotch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pardon&quot;&gt;[http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG3724281/French-first-lady-Carla-Bruni-Sarkozy-sues-bag-makers-Pardon-over-nude-image.html French first lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy sues bag makers Pardon over nude image] – [[The Daily Telegraph]], 12 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 October 2011, Carla Bruni gave birth to a baby girl, Giulia, in the ''Clinique de la Muette'', in [[Paris]].

It has been claimed that Bruni has been involved with [[Louis Bertignac]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Léos Carax]], [[Charles Berling]], Arno Klarsfeld, [[Vincent Perez]]&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.gala.fr/l_actu/on_ne_parle_que_de_ca/carla_bruni_91828 ON NE PARLE QUE DE ÇA | CARLA BRUNI] – Gala&lt;/ref&gt; and former French Prime Minister [[Laurent Fabius]].&lt;ref name=time&gt;''[[Time Magazine]]'', vol. 170, n. 26/27, 31 December 2007 – 7 January 2008.

===The Enthovens===
While living with Jean-Paul Enthoven, Bruni fell in love and started an affair with his son, philosophy professor [[Raphaël Enthoven]] (the song &quot;Raphäel&quot; from Bruni's album ''[[Quelqu'un m'a dit]]'' is named after him), who was at the time married to novelist [[Justine Lévy]], daughter of philosopher [[Bernard-Henri Lévy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.gala.fr/l_actu/on_ne_parle_que_de_ca/quand_carla_bruni_brisait_les_coeurs_91867 When Carla Bruni broke hearts] – Gala, Eliane Georges , 17 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Bruni later denied ever having an affair with Raphaël's father in an interview published in [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]], &quot;I never slept with him, not even a minute.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vanity fair 2008&quot;/&gt;

The affair and the end of her marriage inspired Justine's 2004 book ''Rien de Grave'' (published in English in 2005 as ''Nothing Serious'').&lt;ref&gt;John Follain, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article3087304.ece Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni: Coup de foudre], Times Online, 23 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruni and Raphaël had a son, Aurélien, in 2001. Bruni told ''Vanity Fair'' that the couple broke up in May 2007 because Raphaël thought their relationship did not have a commitment.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanity fair 2008&quot;/&gt;

==Background==
Cecilia Attias was born '''Cécilia María Sara Isabel Ciganer-Albéniz'''. Her elderly father, André Ciganer (born Aron Chouganov) was a Moldovan Jewish immigrant born in [[Bălţi]], [[Bessarabia]] in 1898 of [[Russians|Russian]] and [[Romanians|Romanian]] Jewish lineage, she believed that he was of [[Romani people|Roma]] origin, because of the &quot;Ciganer&quot; surname; however it was later revealed that he was not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/oct/24/france.angeliquechrisafis|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|author=Chrisafis, Angelique|title=The Sarkozys' News|date=24 October 2007|accessdate=2007-12-15 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/united-states/news/article.cfm?l_id=110&amp;objectid=10653900|publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|author=Verena Dobnik|title=Former first lady back in limelight after fresh start|accessdate=2010-06-24|deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left home at the age of 13, just before the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;indie&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2695281.ece| title=Cécilia Sarkozy: The First Lady vanishes |publisher=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2007-06-24|date=19 October 2007 | location=London |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=December 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ciganer moved to Paris, where he became a [[furrier]].&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=SNKICWL0BRPGRQFIQMGCFFWAVCBQUIV0?xml=/news/2005/08/28/wsark28.xml|title=The photographer, the minister, his wife and her 'lover'|author=Day, Elizabeth; Samuel, Henry|date=27 August 2005|accessdate=2007-10-19 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 he married [[Spaniards|Spanish]]-[[Belgians|Belgian]] Diane Albéniz de Swert,&lt;ref name=&quot;indie&quot; /&gt; a daughter of Alfonso Albéniz Jordana, a Spanish diplomat who played with [[Real Madrid]] in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genealogia.netopia.pt/pessoas/pes_show.php?id=595817|publisher=GeneALL.net|title=Genealogy|accessdate=2007-10-19| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929091553/http://genealogia.netopia.pt/pessoas/pes_show.php?id=595817| archivedate = September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realmadrid.com/articulo/rma37492.htm|title=Pre-history and first official title (1900-1910)|accessdate=2007-10-19|publisher=[[Real Madrid C.F.]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071013011406/http://www.realmadrid.com/articulo/rma37492.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her maternal great-grandfather was the Spanish composer [[Isaac Albéniz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Buck, Joan Juliet 2007, page 180&quot;&gt;Buck, Joan Juliet, &quot;Political Heartache&quot;, ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', December 2007, page 180&lt;/ref&gt;

*Ivan Antoine Ciganer-Albéniz

Born with a heart defect, she suffered from cardiac problems which hampered her growth. She underwent open [[cardiac surgery]] when she was 13, and she made up quickly for her growth delay. She stands 1.78 m (5' 10&quot;) tall.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailymail1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[The Daily Mail]]|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/femail/article.html?in_article_id=455411&amp;in_page_id=1879|title=Is Nicolas Sarkozy's wife his femme fatale?|author=Jones, David|date=18 May 2007|accessdate=2007-10-19 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She studied piano (first prize in piano at [[Conservatoire de Paris|Conservatoire]]), and obtained a baccalauréat B, after studying for 13 years in a French religious institution, Sœurs de Lübeck. She studied law in [[University of Paris II: Panthéon-Assas|Assas]]. She went on to become a parliamentary assistant to [[René Touzet (French politician)|René Touzet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcnews1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[BBC]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6656717.stm|title=Sarkozy soap opera grips Paris|date=15 May 2007|author=Wyatt, Caroline|accessdate=2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also was a fitting model for [[Elsa Schiaparelli|Schiaparelli]], the French fashion house, and worked for a public-relations company.&lt;ref name=&quot;indie&quot; /&gt;

==Private life==
Cécilia Ciganer-Albéniz moved in with the popular French TV host [[Jacques Martin (TV host)|Jacques Martin]] in 1983. They married on 10 August 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;indie&quot; /&gt; The wedding took place in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] at the town hall, and [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], then the mayor of Neuilly, conducted the wedding. The Martins had two daughters, Judith Martin (b. August 22, 1984) and Jeanne-Marie Martin (b. June 8, 1987). She has a grandson, Augustin and a granddaughter Diane Elizabeth, born of her daughter Jeanne-Marie.

Nicolas Sarkozy, who was married to his first wife at the time, met his future wife again three years later and has said he felt &quot;struck by lightning&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcnews1&quot; /&gt; Other sources, however, state that Sarkozy fell in love with the bride on her wedding day. In any case, Cécilia Martin would leave her husband to live with Sarkozy in 1988 and obtained a divorce three months later. Once Sarkozy had himself obtained a divorce in 1996, they married in Neuilly on October 23, 1996. The witnesses were [[Martin Bouygues]] and billionaire businessman [[Bernard Arnault]]. Six months later, on April 23, 1997, Cécilia Sarkozy gave birth to the couple's only child, Louis. Nicolas Sarkozy has two sons from his first marriage.

Nicolas Sarkozy once declared that his now-former wife was his &quot;strength and [his] [[Achilles' heel]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/05/28/sarkozy/|title=Sarkozy and his model wife|publisher=[[Salon.com]]|accessdate=2007-10-19|author=Simons, Stefan|date=May 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicolas Sarkozy wrote in his 2005 book, ''Testimony'', &quot;Today, Cécilia and I are reunited for good, for real, doubtless for ever ... [W]e are not able and do not know how to separate from each other.&quot; He has said his wife is his &quot;true soulmate&quot; and &quot;the person without whom nothing I do would be possible&quot;. In July 2007, he said, &quot;At the end of the day, my only real worry is Cécilia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Yahoo!]] News|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070812/ts_afp/franceuspolitics_070812182707;_ylt=AkdUvD7qTPQ4YAeZXI33i6.tOrgF|title=Bucking convention, French first lady snubs Bush invite|accessdate=2007-10-19}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political life==
When her husband was a Minister, Cécilia Sarkozy had an office next to his, serving as his close adviser.

Cécilia Sarkozy visited [[Libya]] twice in July 2007 to visit [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] and helped in securing the release of [[HIV trial in Libya|five Bulgarian nurses and one Palestinian doctor]] who had all spent years on [[Libya]]'s death row after allegedly being tortured into confessing to infecting Libyan babies with the [[HIV]] virus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6896305.stm &quot;Sarkozy's wife visits HIV medics&quot;] ''[[BBC]]'', 13 July 2007 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[French left]] asked for Cécilia Sarkozy to be heard by the Parliamentary Commission expected to be created in October 2007 concerning the terms of the release of the six, as she had played an &quot;important role&quot; in their liberation according to [[Pierre Moscovici]] ([[French Socialist Party|PS]]).&lt;ref name=Liberation_Cecilia&gt;&quot;[http://www.liberation.fr/actualite/politiques/272294.FR.php France-Libye: la gauche réclame des explications à Cécilia Sarkozy]&quot;, in ''[[Libération]]'' (with [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]), 14 August 2007 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divorce==
In October 2007, several French, American, and British media outlets published rumors that the Sarkozys had separated and expected to announce their plans to divorce shortly.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Journal 20 minutes du 15 octobre 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/10/17/europe/sarkozy.php Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife, Cécilia, are filing for divorce, French media reports - International Herald Tribune&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1672040,00.html | work=Time | title=The Sarkozy Soap Opera | date=2007-10-16 | accessdate=2010-04-28 | first=Vivienne | last=Walt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Associated Press]]'' and CNN.com reported on October 18, 2007, that a divorce announcement was imminent. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported  that same day that the Élysée Palace had released a statement declaring that the Sarkozys “announce their separation by mutual consent.” Shortly afterwards, the palace corrected the separation announcement by stating that the Sarkozys had actually officially divorced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/world/europe/19france.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | title=Sarkozy Faces Labor and Marital Crises | first=Elaine | last=Sciolino | date=2007-10-19 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 October 2007, an interview with Cécilia Sarkozy was published on the front page of ''[[L'Est Républicain]]'', a regional French newspaper. In it, she admitted that she had run away with her lover, Richard Attias, in 2005 (&quot;I met someone, I fell in love, I left&quot;) and that though she eventually returned to Sarkozy, they were unable to repair their marriage. &quot;What happened to me has happened to millions of people: one day you no longer have your place in the couple. The couple is no longer the essential thing of your life. It no longer functions; it no longer works.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/20/world/europe/20france.html?hp | work=The New York Times | title=France's Former First Lady Admits Affair and Says Life in Public Eye Isn't for Her | first=Elaine | last=Sciolino | date=2007-10-20 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Andorra}}

The '''Co-Princes of Andorra''' are the two rulers of the [[Andorra|Principality of Andorra]], a tiny landlocked nation lying in the [[Pyrenees]] mountains between [[France]] and [[Spain]].  Founded in 1278 through a treaty between the Spanish [[Bishop of Urgell]] and the French [[Count of Foix]], this unique monarchial arrangement has persisted through medieval times to the present day.  Currently, the Bishop of Urgell and the [[President of France]] serve as Andorra's co-princes, following the transfer of the Count of Foix's claims to the [[King of France|Crown of France]], and thence to the [[French Republic]].  

The Andorran [[principality]] has the unique distinction of being ruled by two non-Andorran sovereigns, one of whom (the French president) is the only [[monarch]] in the world to be elected by the people&amp;mdash;though not by the people of Andorra, but rather those of France.  He is also the only monarch to be the head of state of a [[republic]] at the same time.

==Origin and development of the co-principality==
Tradition holds that [[Charlemagne]] granted a charter to the Andorran people in return for their fighting against the [[Moors]].  The [[Feudalism|feudal overlord]] of this territory was at first the [[Count of Urgell]]; however in 988 the count, Borrell II, gave Andorra to the [[Diocese of Urgell]] in exchange for land in [[Cerdanya]].&lt;ref name=&quot;histo1&quot;&gt;{{Cite GREC|title=La formació d'Andorra|NDCHEC=0003864|en=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bishop of Urgell, based in [[la Seu d'Urgell|Seu d'Urgell]], has ruled Andorra ever since.&lt;ref name=elements&gt;[http://www.coprince-fr.ad/catala/elements.htm Things about the history of Andorra] French Co-prince {{ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{dead link|date=June 2011}}

Before 1095, Andorra did not have any type of military protection and since the Bishop of Urgell knew that the Count of Urgell wanted to reclaim the Andorran valleys,&lt;ref name=elements/&gt; he asked for help from the Lord of Caboet. In 1095, the Lord and the Bishop signed a declaration of their co-sovereignty over Andorra. Arnalda, daughter of Arnau of Caboet, married the Viscount of Castellbò and both became Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya. Their daughter, Ermessenda,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite GREC|title=Ermessenda de Castellbò|NDCHEC=0024413|en=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; married Roger Bernat II, the [[France|French]] [[Count of Foix]]. They became Roger Bernat II and Ermessenda I, Counts of Foix, Viscounts of Castellbò and Cerdanya, and also co-sovereigns of Andorra (together with the Bishop of Urgell).

In the 11th century, a dispute arose between the Bishop of Urgell and the Count of Foix. The conflict mediated by [[Aragon]] in 1278 and led to the signing of the first [[Paréage of Andorra 1278|paréage]], which provided that Andorra's sovereignty be shared between the count&lt;ref name=elements/&gt; and the bishop. This gave the [[principality]] its territory and political form, and marked the formal commencement of Andorra's unique monarchial arrangement.

Over the years, the French co-title to Andorra passed from the Count of Foix to the kings of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]. After King Henry III of Navarre became King [[Henry IV of France]], he issued an edict in 1607 establishing the [[King of France]] and the Bishop of Urgell as co-princes of Andorra. In 1812–13, the [[First French Empire]] annexed [[Catalonia]] and divided it into four [[département]]s, with Andorra forming part of the district of [[Puigcerdà]] (département of [[Sègre]]).  Following the defeat of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]], this annexation was reversed and Andorra reverted to its former independence and political state.  French rulers&amp;mdash;whether king, emperor or president&amp;mdash;would continue to serve as co-princes of Andorra to the present day.

==Recent history==
On July 12, 1934, Andorra's monarchial system was challenged by an adventurer named [[Boris Skossyreff]], who issued a proclamation in Urgel declaring himself &quot;Boris I, King of Andorra&quot;.  Though initially enjoying some support within Andorra's political establishment, he was ultimately arrested by Spanish authorities on July 20 of that year after declaring war on the Bishop of Urgell (who had refused to relinquish his own claim to the principality).  Skossyfreff was expelled, and was never considered to have been the Andorran monarch in any legal sense.

Prior to 1993, Andorra had no written [[constitution]], and the exact prerogatives of the co-princes were not specifically defined in law.  This changed in March of that year, when a [[Constitution of Andorra|constitution]] was approved by a vote of the Andorran people and signed into law by the two co-princes at the time: President [[François Mitterrand]] and Bishop [[Joan Martí Alanis]].  It clarified the continuance of the unique Andorran monarchy, and also delineated the precise role and prerogatives of the two princes.  Prior to adoption of the constitution, Andorra paid in odd-numbered years a tribute of approximately $460 to the French ruler, while on even-numbered years, it paid a tribute of approximately $12 to the Spanish bishop, plus six hams, six cheeses, and six live chickens, though this medieval custom was abandoned in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,912223,00.html Andorra: Septicentennial for a Ministate], from Time, October 30, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, French president Nicholas Sarkozy threatened to resign his title of Andorran co-prince if the principality did not change its banking laws to eliminate its longstanding status as a tax haven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/19/27862 Sarkozy threatens to renounce Andorran title].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary political role==
The Constitution of Andorra carefully defines the exact role and prerogatives of the co-princes of Andorra today.  The constitution establishes Andorra as a &quot;parliamentary coprincipat&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Andorra, 1:4.&lt;/ref&gt; providing for the President of France and Bishop of Urgell to serve together as the joint heads of state.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Andorra, 43:1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  The constitution distinguishes between which powers they may exercise on their own (Article 46), and which require the countersignature of the head of the Andorran government, or the approval of the Syndic General, the Andorran legislature (Article 45).

Powers the princes may exercise on their own include:&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Andorra, Article 46.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Joint exercise of the &quot;prerogative of grace&quot; (the power to pardon);
*Each co-prince may appoint one member of the Superior Council of Justice and one member of the Constitutional Tribunal;
*Establishment of such services as they deem necessary to fulfil their constitutional prerogatives, and appointment of individuals to fulfil these services;
*Requesting a preliminary judgment about the constitutionality of proposed laws, or of international treaties;
*Agreeing to the text of any international treaty, prior to submitting it for parliamentary approval;
*Bringing a case before the Constitutional Tribunal in the event of any conflict over the exercise of their constitutional prerogatives.

Powers the princes may exercize in conjunction with the head of government include:&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Andorra, Article 45.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Calling for elections or referendums in accordance with constitutional provisions;
*Appointing the head of government in accordance with constitutional provisions;
*Dissolve the General Council (the Andorran legislature) prior to the expiration of its current term (but not until at least one year has passed since the prior election);&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Andorra:45:1:E and 71:1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Accrediting diplomatic representatives from Andorra to foreign states, and receive credentials of foreign representatives to Andorra;
*Appointing office-holders in accordance with appropriate constitutional provisions;
*Sanctioning and enacting laws in accordance with constitutional provisions;
*Granting formal consent to international treaties, once ratified by the General Council.

Each prince is granted an annual allowance by the General Council, which they may dispose of as he or she sees fit.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Andorra, 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each appoints a personal representative in Andorra,&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Andorra, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the case of incapacitation of one of them, the constitution provides for the other prince to govern in his or her absence, with the concurrence of the Andorran head of government and/or the General Council.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Andorra, 45:3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain treaties require the participation of the co-princes (or their designated representatives) in their negotiation process as well as their final approval; these are detailed in Articles 66 and 67 of the constitution.  

The co-princes jointly retain the right to propose amendments to the constitution; this same right rests with the General Council.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Andorra, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;  They have no veto power over legislation passed by the General Council, though they do retain a veto over certain international treaties, as described above.

'''Daniel Vaillant''' (born 19 July 1949 in [[Lormes]], Nièvre) is a French [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] politician.

==Biography==
Close to [[Lionel Jospin]], Vaillant held several ministerial portfolios in his cabinets: Minister of the Relations with Parliament from 1997 to 2000 and [[Interior Minister (France)|Interior Minister]] from 2000 to 2002. He also supported Jospin as candidate for the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] in the [[French presidential election, 2007|2007 presidential election]];&lt;ref&gt;Paul Quinio, [http://www.liberation.fr/politiques/010951801-jospin-se-retire-de-sa-retraite-politique Jospin se retire de sa retraite politique], ''Libération'', 29 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; a candidacy which eventually did not materialize.

As of 2009, he is mayor for the 18th district of Paris (first election 1995) and a member of the [[Assemblée Nationale]].

In October 2009, he proposed to decriminalize the personal use of cannabis through control of production and import, as is the case with alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2009/10/09/daniel-vaillant-propose-une-legalisation-controlee-du-cannabis_1251565_3224.html Daniel Vaillant (PS) propose une légalisation contrôlée du cannabis], Le Monde, October 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of France}}
'''Dominique Marie François René Galouzeau de Villepin''' {{IPA-fr|dɔminik də vilpɛ̃|-|Fr-Dominique de Villepin.ogg}} (born 14 November 1953) is a French politician who served as the [[Prime Minister of France]] from 31 May 2005 to 17 May 2007.

A career diplomat, Villepin rose through the ranks of the French right as one of [[Jacques Chirac]]'s protégés. He came into the international spotlight as [[Foreign Minister (France)|Foreign Minister]] with his opposition to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] which culminated with a speech to the UN ([[s:French address on Iraq at the UN Security Council|French address on Iraq at the UN Security Council]]).

Villepin was indicted in connection with the [[Clearstream affair]],&lt;ref name=&quot;charged&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/07/27/europe/EU-GEN-France-Political-Scandal.php Villepin faces charges in smear campaign in France]&quot;, ''International Herald Tribune'', 27 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;De Villepin likely to face conspiracy charges&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=De Villepin likely to face conspiracy charges|date=6 July 2007|accessdate=6 July 2007|work=The Times |location=UK |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article2033979.ece  | first=Charles | last=Bremner}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was subsequently cleared of charges of complicity in allowing [[false accusations]] to proceed against presidential rival [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] regarding bribes paid on a sale of warships to [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{citation | title = France ex-PM Villepin cleared of Sarkozy smear | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8484728.stm | date = 28 January 2010 |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Villepin has enjoyed a modest return to public favour for his public critique of President Sarkozy's style of &quot;imperial rule.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Top politicians warn of 'Sarkozy the monarch'&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Top politicians warn of 'Sarkozy the monarch' | date=18 February 2008 | accessdate=18 February 2008 |work=The Independent |location=UK |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/europe/top-politicians-warn-of-sarkozy-the-monarch-783553.html  | first=John | last=Lichfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has written poetry, a book about poetry, and several historical and political essays, along with a study of Napoleon Bonaparte.

Villepin is an Honorary Member of the [[International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation]].

One of the most vocal right-wing opponents of President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], on 8 September, he announced his candidature for [[President of France]] in [[French presidential election 2012|2012]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Villepin consider a presidential run'&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title= Dominique de Villepin souhaite pouvoir être candidat en 2012'|date=24 April 2009|accessdate=24 April 2009|work=[[NouvelObs]]|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/depeches/politique/20090424.FAP8396/presidentielle_dominique_de_villepin_souhaite_pouvoir_e.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 March 2010, he announced that he would form a new center-right political movement in order to offer an alternative to Sarkozy in the 2012 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/7521419/Dominique-de-Villepin-launches-new-party.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London  | title=Dominique de Villepin launches new party with swipe at Nicolas Sarkozy Dominique de Villepin, France's former prime minister, has officially launched a new political movement with a swipe at the &quot;failure&quot; his arch-rival, Nicolas Sarkozy. | first=Henry | last=Samuel | date=25 March 2010 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new party, named ''[[United Republic (France)|République solidaire]]'', was formally launched on 18 June 2010 on the 70th anniversary of General de Gaulle's &quot;Appeal of 18 June&quot; in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703409804575143902882127976.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=De Villepin Plans New Party | first=David | last=Gauthier-Villars | date=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Villepin was born in [[Rabat, Morocco]] and spent some time in [[Venezuela]], where his family lived for four years. He graduated from the [[Lycée Français de New York]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lfnyalumni.org Lycée Français de New York Alumni Association]&lt;/ref&gt; He has three children: [[Marie de Villepin|Marie]] (b. 1986), Arthur, and Victoire (b. 1989).

Villepin's family derives from the middle class (the family was never aristocratic, and was responsible for adding the particle &quot;de&quot; to their own name).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/6752087/Nicolas-Sarkozy-has-the-last-laugh-on-aristocratic-rivals.html &quot;Nicolas Sarkozy has the last laugh on 'aristocratic' rivals&quot;] by Henry Samuel,''The Daily Telegraph'', 8 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; His great-grandfather was a [[colonel]] in the French army, his grandfather was a board member for several companies, and his father [[Xavier de Villepin]], now retired, was a diplomat and a member of the [[French Senate|Senate]]. Villepin speaks French, English and Spanish.

==Career==
===Diplomat===
Villepin studied at the [[Paris Institute of Political Studies|Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris]] (Sciences-Po) and went on to the [[École nationale d'administration]] (ENA), France's highly selective post-graduate school which trains its top civil servants. Villepin also holds degrees in Civil law and French literature from the universities of [[Paris II Panthéon-Assas]] and [[Paris X Nanterre]]. At the end of his studies he completed his military service as a naval officer on board the Aircraft Carrier Clemenceau, Villepin then entered a career in diplomacy. His assignments were:
*Advising Committee on African affairs (1980–1984)
*The French embassy in Washington, D.C. (1984–1989), as ''premier secrétaire'' until 1987 and then ''deuxième conseiller''
*The embassy in New Delhi (1989–1992), as ''deuxième conseiller'' until 1990 and then ''premier conseiller''
*Foreign Ministry's top adviser on Africa (1992–1993)

===Politician===
Villepin was introduced to Jacques Chirac in the early 1980s and became one of his advisers on foreign policy. In 1993 he became chief of staff (''directeur de cabinet'') of [[Alain Juppé]], the [[Foreign Minister (France)|Foreign Minister]] in [[Édouard Balladur]]'s cabinet, who was Chirac's political [[heir apparent]].

Villepin then became director of Chirac's successful 1995 presidential campaign and was rewarded with the key job of Secretary-General of the [[Élysée Palace]] during Chirac's first term as [[president of France|President of the Republic]] (1995–2002). He advised the president to hold an early general election in 1997, while the [[French National Assembly]] was overwhelmingly dominated by the president's party. This was a risky gamble, and Chirac's party went on to lose the elections. Villepin offered Chirac his resignation afterwards, but it was turned down. Villepin's flawed advice on the election increased the perception among many politicians on the right that Villepin had no experience or understanding of grassroots politics, and owed his enviable position only to being Chirac's protégé.

Villepin has had an uneasy relationship with the members of his own political side. He has in the past made a number of demeaning remarks on members of parliament from his own party. In addition, the mutual distaste between Villepin and [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], head of the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP) majority party, is well-known.

===Foreign Minister===
He was appointed Foreign Minister by Chirac in the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] at the beginning of Chirac's second term in 2002.

During the [[2004 Haitian coup d'état|2004 coup d'état]] in Haiti, Villepin obtained the backing of the [[United States Secretary of State]], [[Colin Powell]], in his bid to oust [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]] from power.

Villepin's most famous assignment as Chirac's Foreign Minister was opposing the U.S. plan to [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invade]] [[Iraq]], giving France a leading role in the grouping of countries such as Germany, Belgium, Russia and China that opposed the invasion. The speech&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignpolicy.org.tr/documents/villepin_140203_p.htm |title=Statement by Dominique de Villepin to the UNSC |publisher=Foreignpolicy.org.tr |date=14 February 2003 |accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; he gave to the UN to block a second resolution allowing the use of force against [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime received loud applause.

During mid-2003 Villepin organized the [[Opération 14 juillet]] that attepted to rescue his former student, [[Ingrid Betancourt]], who was being held by [[FARC]] rebels in Colombia. The operation failed, and because he had neither informed Colombia, Brazil, nor President Chirac of the mission, it resulted in a political scandal.

===Interior Minister===
During the cabinet reshuffle that made [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] [[Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industry (France)|Finance Minister]], Villepin was appointed to replace him as [[List of Interior Ministers of France|Interior Minister]] on 31 March 2004.

His actions against radical Islam included mandatory courses for Muslim clerics, notably in the French language (a third of them may not be fluent in the national language), in moderate Muslim theology and in French secularism: ''[[laïcité]]'', [[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|Republican principles]] and the law. While Sarkozy created the [[French Council of the Muslim Faith]], an official body which is now dominated by Orthodoxes, Villepin would have preferred a &quot;Muslim foundation&quot;, in which mosque-based representatives would be balanced by secular Muslims.

He also cracked down on radical Muslim clerics, causing an uproar when he tried to expel [[Abdelkader Bouziane]], an [[imam]] alleged to have said to the press that, according to Ancient Islamic texts, adulterous people could be whipped or [[stoning|stoned]]. When the decision to expel him was overturned by the courts, because of the journalistic reporting of LyonMag was deemed biaised, Villepin pushed a change of the law through Parliament, and Bouziane was sent home.

===Prime Minister===
President Chirac was at one point thought to have turned his eye on Villepin as a possible successor, assuming that he himself would not enter the 2007 presidential contest. However, Nicolas Sarkozy was chosen to represent the centre-right UMP party.

On 29 May 2005, French voters in the [[French referendum on the European Constitution|referendum]] on the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]] turned down the proposed document by a wide margin. Two days later, Raffarin resigned and Chirac appointed Villepin as [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]].

====''Contrat Première Embauche'' (First Employment Contract)====
{{Main|First Employment Contract}}
On Thursday, 16 March 2006, tens of thousands of French university and school students marched to demand the government scrap a contentious youth jobs clause, known as First Employment Contract (CPE). The law, intended as a response to the [[2005 civil unrest in France|2005 riots]], was intended to stimulate job growth and arrest the 23% youth unemployment rate by allowing employers to fire employees aged under 26 within the first two years of their employment for any or no reason. Supporters of the law argued that such probationary arrangements are not unusual in Western countries and that the current system in France discourages employers from hiring people whom they may be unable to fire if they prove unsuitable for the job. Critics argue that it discriminates unnecessarily against the young and decreases job security. The union movement issued an ultimatum to Villepin to scrap the law by 20 March or face a general strike. This ultimatum expired without concession. A general strike was called for 28 March.

====General strike, demonstrations, and the fall of Villepin====
On 28 March, between one and three million people demonstrated across France. The protests were accompanied by some violence and 800 people were arrested, 500 of them in Paris. Prime Minister Villepin refused to withdraw the CPE but called for negotiations on adapting it. The demonstrators for the most part called for the complete withdrawal of the CPE.

The CPE was withdrawn by Jacques Chirac on 10 April.&lt;ref name=&quot;NZHerald&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10377013 |title=French students set for jobs law 'victory march' |date=11 April 2006 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====More unrest for Villepin====
On 20 June 2006, during the questions to government in the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]], Dominique de Villepin accused head of the Socialist Party [[François Hollande]] of [[cowardice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/cri/2005-2006/20060247.asp |title=Assemblée nationale ~ Deuxième séance du mardi 20 juin 2006 |publisher=Assemblee-nationale.fr |accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hollande had questioned the Prime Minister about the recent &quot;[[insider trading]]&quot; scandal involving the aerospace company [[EADS]] and executive [[Noël Forgeard]]. This triggered an incident in the Assembly, with Socialist deputies converging on the government benches until they were stopped by the Assembly ushers. Hollande demanded apologies and the resignation of the Prime Minister;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/page.php?Article=391985 Libération – Toute l'actualité monde, politique, société, culture, débats... sur Liberation.fr]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the next day, Dominique de Villepin apologized. This event resulted in criticism even from Villepin's own [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] party, with UMP parliamentarians including Assembly vice-president [[Yves Bur]] suggesting that president [[Jacques Chirac|Chirac]] should appoint another Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=e-TF1 |url=http://tf1.lci.fr/infos/france/0,,3311088,00.html |title=Assemblée : Villepin présente ses excuses à Hollande – France – LCI |publisher=Tf1.lci.fr |accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Clearstream affair====
In 2004, French judges were given a list by an anonymous source containing the names of politicians and others who, it was alleged, had deposited kickbacks from a 1991 arms sale to Taiwan into secret accounts at Clearstream, a private bank in Luxembourg. The most prominent name on the list was that of Nicolas Sarkozy, Villepin's rival for power in the UMP. The list was later shown to be fraudulent, a discovery Villepin kept from the public for 15 months at a time when the two men were vying for party supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/france/story/0,,2123207,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London  | title=De Villepin could face charges over smear plot against Sarkozy | first=Angelique | last=Chrisafis | date=11 July 2007 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the source of the list was later revealed to be a longtime associate of Villepin's, one Jean-Louis Gergorin, an executive at EADS. Critics claimed that Villepin, perhaps with the support of then-president Jacques Chirac, had tried to defame his rival. Sarkozy, in turn, filed a suit against whoever was behind the creation of the Clearstream list. An investigation continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/05/22/world/main1640276.shtml | work=CBS News | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=November 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidential bid===
There was speculation that Villepin might be a candidate in the [[French presidential election, 2007|2007 Presidential election]]; however, interior minister [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] was selected unopposed as the UMP's presidential candidate on 14 January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6260275.stm |work=BBC News   | title=Sarkozy nod for presidential run | date=14 January 2007 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 March 2007 Villepin formally endorsed Sarkozy for President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/13/world/europe/13france.html | work=The New York Times | title=French Premier Throws Support for Presidency to Political Rival | first=Elaine | last=Sciolino | date=13 March 2007 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Villepin's first cabinet===
In an address to the nation, Chirac had declared that the new cabinet's top priority would be to curb unemployment, which was consistently hovering above 10%, calling for a &quot;national mobilization&quot; to that effect.

Villepin's cabinet was marked by its small membership (for France), and its hierarchical unity: all members had the rank of Minister, and there were no Secretaries of State, the lowest cabinet member rank. The aim of this decision was for the cabinet to form a close-knit and more efficient team to combat unemployment.

The economy was growing sluggishly and a significant drop in unemployment was yet to be seen. Villepin's aim was therefore to restore the French people's trust in their government, an achievement for which he publicly set himself a deadline of a hundred days from the appointment of cabinet.

Another issue was the [[European Constitution]], rejected by France and the Netherlands in referenda.

Some had speculated that Villepin, with his diplomatic experience and the prestige associated with the job of Prime Minister, would negotiate a new treaty with the [[European Union]], while Sarkozy would run the country at home. However, Villepin obtained favorable reviews from the press and temporarily increased popularity in polls. In particular, he was increasingly cited as a possible [[French presidential election, 2007|presidential candidate for 2007]], although Nicolas Sarkozy had publicly stated that he himself was giving considerable attention to that election. Villepin and Sarkozy initially avoided any open division.

Villepin declared that lowering unemployment was the number one objective of his government (which had also been stated by other prime ministers before him, albeit to no avail). He, as well as the UMP party, believed that France's workforce rules were too rigid and discouraged employment, and that some liberalizing reforms were necessary in order to &quot;correct&quot; the French social model.

On 2 August 2005 he issued [[Ordonnance (French constitutional law)|ordinances]] establishing a new kind of work contract (called ''CNE'') for small enterprises, with fewer guarantees than ordinary contracts. While Villepin's measures would surely have been approved by his wide UMP majority in Parliament. Villepin said the government needed to act fast, especially when Parliament was going on its summer recess.

On 16 January 2006 he announced a similar kind of work contract (called ''[[Contrat première embauche]]'', or ''CPE'') for young people (under 26). The parliament approved on 8 February. Subsequently students started to [[2006 labor protests in France|protest]]. This wave of protest eventually forced the government to give in. Although the law on the ''CPE'' is formally still valid, the government promised to hinder its application and initiated a new legal initiative which will abolish the key points of the ''CPE''. During the protests, Villepin was widely perceived as stubborn and arrogant. As a consequence, his popularity rates went down rapidly and he was no longer regarded as a serious contender for the 2007 presidential election.

Another major issue in Villepin's government was the state of the national budget. France runs high deficits, which run afoul of the rules set in the EU [[Maastricht Treaty]]. Villepin's margin of maneuver in that respect was extremely slim.

===Resignation===
On 15 May 2007, the last full day of President [[Jacques Chirac]]'s term, Villepin tendered his resignation from the office of Prime Minister and it was accepted by the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais/salle_de_presse/communiques_de_la_presidence/2007/mai/demission_du_gouvernement_communique.76618.html |title=Démission du gouvernement: communiqué. – Présidence de la République |publisher=Elysee.fr |date=21 December 2009 |accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced two days later by [[François Fillon]].

==Post Prime Ministerial career==
===Context of Villepin's political career===
Villepin has never held elected office; the [[Constitution of France|French Constitution]] allows the president to appoint unelected ministers. This is a political liability for him, because he is periodically accused of being out of touch with the realities of ordinary citizens. He is also reported to despise elected officials, calling members of Parliament ''connards'' (an insult).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/page.php?Article=369569 Libération – Toute l'actualité monde, politique, société, culture, débats... sur Liberation.fr]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Villepin is not the first &quot;unelected&quot; prime minister, even in the relatively short history of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]]: notable predecessors include [[Georges Pompidou]], who was a banker before being called to office, and [[Raymond Barre]], who had a previous career as a professor and appointed official, and started an elected career only after being Prime minister.

===Clearstream trial===
On the first day of the civil trial for his part in the Clearstream Affair, Villepin accused Pres. Sarkozy of pursuing him for political reasons. Sarkozy has the status of a civil plaintiff in the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alalam.ir/english/detail.aspx?id=80490 &quot;Villepin Rejects Sarkozy Slander Charges&quot;]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Thursday, 28 January 2010 the judgement was finally handed down and Villepin was acquitted of every accusation against him in the affair.
The following morning the prosecution announced that it would file an appeal against this verdict, thus further dragging out the affair another year. Villepin was finally cleared by an Appeals Court in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2011/0915/1224304142392.html &quot;Appeals court clears de Villepin of smear charges'']
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== République Solidaire and Presidential Run===
In 2011, Villepin quit the UMP and set up a new party, [[United Republic (France)|République Solidaire]] and is considering running for president in the 2012 elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Guardian |location=UK |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/14/sarkozy-villepin-manifesto-president-2012|title= Sarkozy's arch-enemy Villepin outlines his political manifesto|date=14 April 2011|author=Angelique Chrisafis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Édouard Balladur''' ({{IPA-fr|edwaʁ baladyʁ}}; born 2 May 1929) is a French politician who served as [[Prime Minister of France]] from 29 March 1993 to 10 May 1995.

==Biography==
Balladur was born in [[İzmir]], Turkey, to an [[Armenians|Armenia]]n Catholic family with five children and long-standing ties to France. His family emigrated to [[Marseille]] in 1935.

In 1957, Balladur married Marie-Josèphe Delacour, with whom he had four sons.

Balladur started his political career in 1964 as an advisor to Prime Minister [[Georges Pompidou]]. After Pompidou's election as [[President of France]] in 1969, Balladur was appointed under-secretary general of the presidency then secretary general from 1973 to Georges Pompidou's death in 1974.

He returned to politics in the 1980s as a supporter of [[Jacques Chirac]]. A member of the Neo-Gaullist [[Gaullist Party|Rally for the Republic]] (RPR) party, he was the theoretician behind the &quot;[[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation government]]&quot; from 1986 to 1988, explaining that if the right won the legislative election, it could govern with Chirac as Prime Minister without [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] President [[François Mitterrand]]'s resignation. As [[Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industry (France)|Minister of Economy and Finance]], he sold off a large number of public companies and abolished the wealth tax. He appeared as an unofficial deputy Prime Minister in the cabinet led by Chirac. He took a major part in the adoption of liberal and pro-European policies by Chirac and the RPR. After Chirac's defeat at the [[French presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]], a part of the RPR held him responsible of the abandonment of [[Gaullism|Gaullist doctrine]] but he kept the confidence of Chirac.

===Prime Minister===
When the RPR/[[Union for French Democracy|UDF]] coalition won the [[French legislative election, 1993|1993 legislative election]], Chirac declined to become Prime Minister again in a second &quot;cohabitation&quot; with President Mitterrand, and Balladur became Prime Minister. He was faced with a difficult economic situation but he did not want to make the political errors of the previous cohabitation government. If he failed to impose his project of minimum income for youth, he led a moderate liberal policy in economy.&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, Mairi: Privatisation in France 1993–94: new departures, or a case of plus ca change? – In: West European Politics (London), 18 (April 1995) 2, S. 273 290&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- not sure about the meaning of the previous sentence --&gt; Conveying the image of a quiet conservative, he did not question the [[wealth tax]] (reestablished by the Socialists in 1988). Despite corruption affairs affecting some of his ministers, who he forced to resign (thus lending his name to the so-called &quot;[[Balladur jurisprudence]]&quot;), he became very popular and had the support of influential media.

===1995 Presidential Election===
When he became Prime Minister, Balladur had promised Chirac that he would not enter the [[French presidential election, 1995|1995 presidential election]], and that he would support Chirac's candidacy. However a number of right-wing politicians advised Balladur to run for the presidency in 1995. He went back on his promise to Chirac and entered the campaign. When he announced his candidacy, four months before the election, he was considered the favourite. In the polls, he led Chirac by almost 20 points. However from the position of an outsider, Chirac criticized Balladur as representing &quot;dominant ideas&quot;, and the difference between the two decreased quickly. The revelation of a bugging scandal which implicated Balladur also contributed to a drop in his popularity among voters. 

In the first round of the election, Balladur finished in third place with 18.6% of the vote behind the Socialist candidate [[Lionel Jospin]] and Chirac. He was thus eliminated from the final run-off election between the top two candidates which Chirac won.

Chirac immediately appointed [[Alain Juppé]] to replace Balladur as Prime Minister. Despite Chirac declaring that he and Balladur had been &quot;friends for 30 years&quot;, Balladur's decision to stand against him greatly strained their relationship. As a result, the &quot;Balladuriens&quot; who had supported him in the presidential election (such as [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]) were ostracized from the new Chirac administration.

===Later political career===
Balladur failed to win the elections for the presidency of the [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]] region in 1998, the RPR nomination for the mayoralty of Paris in 2001, and the Chair of the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] in 2002. He presided over the National Assembly's foreign affairs committee during his last parliamentary term (2002–2007). Since the 1980s, he had advocated the unification of the right-wing groupings into a single large party. Chirac realized this with the creation of the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] in 2002.

In 2007, when Nicolas Sarkozy was elected President of France, he nominated Balladur to the head of a committee for institutional reforms. The constitutional revision was approved by the Parliament in July 2008.

From 1968 to 1980, Balladur was president of the French company of the [[Mont Blanc Tunnel]], while occupying various other positions in ministerial staff. Following the 1999 deadly accident in the tunnel, he gave evidence to the court judging the case in 2005, about the security measures he had or had not taken. Balladur claimed that he always took security seriously, but that it was difficult to agree on anything with the Italian company operating the Italian part of the tunnel. From 1977 to 1986, he was president of ''Générale de Service Informatique'' (later merged into [[IBM Global Services]]), making him one of the few French politicians with business experience.

In 2006 he announced that he would not run again for re-election in 2007 as a member of Parliament for the 15th ''arrondissement'' of Paris, a conservative stronghold.

In 2008, Balladur visited the United States to speak at an event organized by the [[Streit Council|Streit Council for a Union of Democracies]], a [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]-based [[think tank|think-tank]]. Balladur presented his latest book, in which he outlined a concept for a &quot;Union of the West.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://streitcouncil.org/content/activities/events/balladur_08/balladur_bio.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Balladur is often caricatured as aloof, aristocratic and arrogant in media such as the ''[[Canard Enchaîné]]'' weekly or the ''[[Les Guignols de l'info]]'' TV show.

The '''Élysée Palace''' ({{lang-fr|Palais de l'Élysée}}, {{IPA-fr|palɛ də lelize|pron}}) is the [[official residence]] of the [[President of the French Republic]], containing his office, and is where the Council of Ministers meets. It is located near the [[Champs-Élysées]] in [[Paris]].

Important foreign visitors are hosted at the nearby [[Hôtel de Marigny]], a palatial residence. The Élysée has gardens, in which the president hosts a party on the afternoon of [[Bastille Day]]. [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], the President of France since 2007, is the current resident.

==History==

The architect Armand-Claude Mollet&lt;ref&gt;Armand Claude Mollet (1660-1742), from the [[Claude Mollet|Mollet dynasty of royal gardeners]], was the house architect for Henri-Louis, comte de Dreux. Sharing responsibilities for the [[Tuileries Garden]] with [[André Le Nôtre]]'s nephew [[Jean Le Nôtre]], he was accepted into the [[Académie royale d'architecture]] in 1699.&lt;/ref&gt; possessed a property fronting on the road to the village of Roule, west of Paris (now the [[Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré]]), and backing onto royal property, the ''Grand Cours'' through the [[Champs-Élysées]]. He sold this in 1718 to [[Louis Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne]], [[Évreux|comte d'Évreux]] (families: ducs and princes de Bouillon et Sedan: [[de la Marck]] | von der Marck), with the agreement that Mollet would construct an ''[[hôtel particulier]]'' for the count, fronted by an [[Cour d'honneur|entrance court]] and backed by a garden. The ''Hôtel d'Évreux'' was finished and decorated by 1722, and though it has undergone many modifications since, it remains a fine example of the French [[Classicism|classical]] style. At the time of his death in 1753, Évreux was the owner of one of the most widely admired houses in Paris, and it was bought by King [[Louis XV]] as a residence for the [[Marquise de Pompadour]], his mistress. Opponents showed their distaste for the regime by hanging signs on the gates that read: &quot;Home of the King's whore&quot;{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. After her death, it reverted to the crown.

In 1773, it was purchased by [[Nicolas Beaujon]], banker to the Court and one of the richest men in France, who needed a suitably sumptuous &quot;country house&quot; (for the city of Paris did not yet extend this far) to house his fabulous collection of great masters paintings. To this end, he hired the architect [[Étienne-Louis Boullée]] to make substantial alterations to the buildings (as well as  design an English-style garden). Soon on display there were such well-known masterpieces as [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein's]] ''The Ambassadors'' (now in the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]] in [[London]]), and [[Frans Hals]]' ''Bohemian'' (now at the [[Louvre]]). His architectural alterations and art galleries gave this residence international renown as &quot;one of the premier houses of Paris&quot;.

The palace and gardens were purchased from Beaujon by [[Bathilde d'Orléans|Bathilde, duchesse de Bourbon]] in 1787 for 1,300,000 ''livres''.&lt;ref&gt;C. Leroux-Cesbron, ''Le palais de l'Élysée, chronique d'un palais national'', 1925, deuxième édition, page 76.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the Duchess who named it the ''Élysée''.  She also built a group of cottages in the gardens which she named the [[Hameau de Chantilly (Paris)|Hameau de Chantilly]], after the [[Hameau de Chantilly|Hameau]] at her father-in-law's [[Château de Chantilly]].  With the [[French Revolution]], the Duchess fled the country and the Élysée was confiscated.  It was leased out. The gardens were used for eating, drinking, and dancing, under the name Hameau de Chantilly; and the rooms became gambling houses.&lt;ref name='haynie'&gt;Henry Haynie, ''Paris: Past &amp; Present'' '''2''', New York, 1902. [http://books.google.com/books?id=LUHoQHxR0MMC at Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1803, the Élysée was sold to [[Joachim Murat]], and in 1808, to [[Napoléon I|the Emperor]], and it became known as the Élysée-Napoléon.  After the [[Battle of Waterloo]], Napoléon returned to the Élysée, signed his [[abdication]] there on 22 June 1815, and left the Élysée on the 25th.&lt;ref name='haynie'/&gt;

Russian Cossacks camped at the Élysée when they occupied Paris in 1814. The property was then returned to it's previous owner, the Duchesse de Bourbon, who then sold it to her royal cousin, [[Louis XVIII]] in 1816.

Under the provisional government of the [[Second French Republic|Second Republic]], it took the name of the ''Élysée National'' and was designated the official residence of the President of the Republic. (The President also has the use of several other official residences, including the [[Château de Rambouillet]], forty five kilometres southwest of Paris, and the [[Fort de Brégançon]] near [[Marseille]].)
[[File:Palais elysee.jpg|thumb|right|250px| The palace seen from the gardens]]
In 1853, following his ''coup d'état'' that ended the Second Republic, [[Napoleon III of France|Napoléon III]] charged the architect Joseph-Eugène Lacroix with renovations; meanwhile he moved to the nearby [[Tuileries Palace]], but kept the Élysée as a discreet place to meet his mistresses, moving between the two palaces through a secret underground passage that has since been demolished.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Since Lacroix completed his work in 1867, the essential look of the ''Palais de l'Élysée'' has remained the same.

In 1873, during the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]], The Élysée became the official presidential residence.

In 1917, an [[orangutan]] escaped from a nearby ''[[menagerie|ménagerie]]'', entered the palace and was said to have tried to haul the wife of President [[Raymond Poincaré]] into a tree only to be foiled by Élysée guards. President [[Paul Deschanel]], who resigned in 1920 because of mental illness, was said to have been so impressed by the orangutan's feat that, to the alarm of his guests, he took to jumping into trees during state receptions.

The Élysée Palace was closed in June 1940, and remained empty during [[World War II]]. It was reoccupied only in 1946 by [[Vincent Auriol]], President of the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|Provisional Government]], then first President of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] from 1947 to 1954.

Between 1959 and 1969, the Élysée was occupied by [[Charles de Gaulle]], the first President of the [[Fifth French Republic|Fifth Republic]]. De Gaulle did not like its lack of privacy, and oversaw the purchase of the luxurious [[Hôtel de Marigny]] to lodge foreign State officials in visit to France, saying, &quot;I do not like the idea of meeting kings walking around my corridors in their pyjamas.&quot;
[[Image:Salon doré Palais de l'Élysée1.JPG|thumb|right|250px||The &quot;Salon doré&quot; (''Golden Room''), office of the [[President of the French Republic]].]]
Socialist President [[François Mitterrand]], who governed from 1981 to 1995, is said to have seldom used its private apartments, preferring the privacy of his own home on the more [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] [[Left Bank]]. A discreet flat in the Élysée housed his mistress [[Anne Pingeot]], mother of his illegitimate daughter [[Mazarine Pingeot]].

By contrast, his successor [[Jacques Chirac]] lived throughout his two terms in office (1995–2007) in the Élysée apartments with his wife [[Bernadette Chirac|Bernadette]].

Chirac increased the Palace's budget by 105% to 90 million euros per year, according to the book ''L'argent caché de l'Élysée''. One million euros per year is spent on drinks alone for the guests invited to the Élysée Palace, 6.9 million euros per year on bonuses for presidential staff and 6.1 million euros per year on the 145 extra employees Chirac hired after he was elected in 1995.&lt;!-- the President's salary does not come out of the budget of the Élysée Palace/FW --&gt;

Chirac's successor [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] prefers his wife [[Carla Bruni-Sarkozy]]'s house in Paris XVI to the Élysée palace.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The '''French Fourth Republic''' was the [[republicanism|republican]] government of [[France]] between 1946 and 1958, governed by the fourth republican [[Constitution of France|constitution]]. It was in many ways a revival of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]], which was in place before [[World War II]], and suffered many of the same problems. France adopted the constitution of the Fourth Republic on 13 October 1946.

The Fourth Republic saw an era of great economic growth in France and the rebuilding of the nation's social institutions and industry after the war, and played an important part in the development of the process of European integration which changed the continent permanently. The greatest accomplishments of the Fourth Republic were in social reform and economic development. In 1946, the government established a comprehensive social security system that assured unemployment insurance, disability and old-age pensions, and medical care to all citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;&quot;France&quot;, Microsoft® Encarta® Encyclopedia 2001. © 1993-2000 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some attempts were also made to strengthen the executive branch of government to prevent the unstable situation that had existed before the war, but the instability remained and the Fourth Republic saw frequent changes in government – there were 20 governments in ten years. Additionally, the government proved unable to make effective decisions regarding [[decolonization]]. As a result, the Fourth Republic collapsed and what some critics considered to be a de facto ''coup d'état'', subsequently legitimized by a referendum on 5 October 1958, led to the establishment of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] in 1959.

==Founding of the Fourth Republic (1944–47)==
{{Main|Three-parties |Third Force (France)}}

After the [[liberation of France]], the [[Vichy government]] was dissolved and the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] (GPRF) was instituted. With most of the political class discredited and containing many members who had more or less [[Collaborationism|collaborated]] with the enemy, Gaullism and Communism became the most popular political forces in France.

Charles de Gaulle led the GPRF from 1944 to 1946. Meanwhile, negotiations took place over the proposed new Constitution, which was to be put to a referendum. De Gaulle advocated a presidential system of government, and criticized the reinstatement of what he pejoratively called &quot;the parties system&quot;. He resigned in January 1946 and was replaced by [[Félix Gouin]] (SFIO). Ultimately only the PCF and the SFIO supported the draft Constitution, which envisaged a form of government based on [[unicameralism]]; but this was rejected in the [[French constitutional referendum, May 1946|referendum of 5 May 1946]].

For the 1946 elections, the [[Rally of the Republican Lefts|RGR]] (''Rassemblement des gauches républicaines''), which encompassed the [[Radical-Socialist Party]], the UDSR and other conservative parties, unsuccessfully attempted to oppose the MRP-SFIO-PCF alliance. The new [[Constituent Assembly]] included 166 MRP deputies, 153 PCF deputies and 128 SFIO deputies, giving the Tripartite alliance an [[absolute majority]]. [[Georges Bidault]] (MRP) replaced [[Félix Gouin]] as the head of government. 

A new draft of the Constitution was written, which this time proposed the establishment of a [[bicameral]] form of government. [[Léon Blum]] (SFIO) headed the GPRF from 1946 to 1947. After a new legislative election in June 1946, the Christian-Democrat [[Georges Bidault]] assumed leadership of the cabinet. Despite de Gaulle's so-called [[discourse of Bayeux]] of 16 June 1946 in which he denounced the new institutions, the new draft was approved by the [[French people]], with 53% of voters voting in favor (with an [[abstention]] rate of 31%) in the [[French constitutional referendum, October 1946|referendum held on 13 October 1946]]. This culminated in the establishment in the following year of the [[Fourth Republic]], an arrangement in which executive power essentially resided in the hands of the [[President of the Council]]. The [[President of the Republic]] was given a largely symbolic role, although he remained chief of the Army and as a last resort could be called upon to resolve conflicts.

==The failure of the rationalization of the parliamentary system==

The intention of Constitutional text's writers was to rationalize the parliamentary system. In this, the ministers were accountable to the legislative body, the [[French National Assembly]]), but some constitutional measures were introduced in order to protect the cabinet and to reinforce the authority of the [[Prime Minister of France|President of the Council]], who lead the cabinet. The goal of the constituents was to reconcile parliamentary democracy and ministerial stability.

For instance, according to the Constitution, the President of the Council was the leader of the executive branch. The [[President of the French Republic]], elected by the Parliament (the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] and the [[Council of the Republic]]), played a symbolic role. His main power was to propose a President of the Council. This one was elected by the National Assembly before to form his cabinet. In this, in the cabinet, only the President of the Council could invoke the legitimacy of the parliamentary vote.

Also, he was the only member of the executive power to provoke a vote of confidence in the National Assembly (in the Third Republic, any minister could provoke a vote of confidence). The cabinet could be dismissed if the absolute majority of National Assembly's members voted against the cabinet. Finally, the National Assembly could be dissolved after two ministerial crisis in the legislature.

However, these constitutional measures did not work. In January 1947, after his election by the National Assembly and the nomination of his ministers, President of the Council [[Paul Ramadier]] provoked a vote of confidence in order to verify the Assembly approved the composition of his cabinet. He introduced a custom: the double election, which weakened his authority over the cabinet. Besides, the cabinets dismissed but only a plurality (not the absolute majority) of the National Assembly voting against the cabinet. Consequently, these ministerial crisis were not take into account into the calculation for the release of the dissolution. The habits of the Third Republic were come back at full speed and the regime was characterized by a strong ministerial instability.

The Fourth Republic was victim of the political context. The split of the [[Three-parties]] alliance in spring 1947, the departure of Communist ministers, Gaullist opposition, and the new proportional representation did not create the conditions of a ministerial stability. Governmental coalitions were composed of a patchwork of undisciplined centre-left and centre-right parties. Finally, the Fourth Republic faced with the collapse of the French colonial empire.

==European Unity==

The creation of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC) was first proposed by French foreign minister &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;[[Robert Schuman]]&lt;/span&gt; and French economic theorist &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;[[Jean Monnet]]&lt;/span&gt; on 9 May 1950 as a way to prevent further war between France and Germany. Though the United Kingdom was invited, its Labour government, then preparing for a re-election fight, did not join the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Dell, Edmund (1995). ''The Schuman Plan and the British Abdication of Leadership in Europe''. Oxford: Clarendon Press. {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was formally established in 1951 by the [[Treaty of Paris (1951)|Treaty of Paris]], signed France, Italy and the three [[Benelux]] states: Belgium, [[Luxembourg]] and the Netherlands. Between these states the ECSC would create a common market for coal and steel. The ECSC was governed by a 'High Authority', checked by bodies representing governments, MPs and an independent judiciary.

The ECSC was superseded, on 25 March 1957, by the [[Treaty of Rome]], which established the [[European Economic Community]] (which would, in 1993, become the [[European Union]] through the [[Treaty of Maastricht]]).

==Decolonization and end of the Fourth Republic==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Algerian War]] --&gt;
[[Algerian War|Rebellion in Algeria]] began soon after [[French Indochina|Indochinese]] independence. The government was initially successful in containing the rebellion, but the [[torture during the Algerian War|torture]] methods used by French military and security forces caused an enormous scandal when made public.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} The use of [[conscription]] also made the war extremely socially divisive. While French forces were victorious from a strictly military point of view, a large section of the public questioned the morality of maintaining colonies by force.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

The instability and ineffectiveness of the Fourth Republic came to a head in the [[May 1958 crisis|Algiers crisis of 1958]], when the current government suggested that it would negotiate with the Algerian nationalists. Right-wing elements in the [[French Army]], led by General &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;[[Jacques Massu]]&lt;/span&gt;, seized power in [[Algiers]] and threatened to conduct a parachute assault on Paris unless &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;[[Charles de Gaulle]]&lt;/span&gt; was placed in charge of the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crozier |first=Brian |coauthors=Mansell, Gerard |year=1960 |month=July |title=France and Algeria |journal=[[International Affairs (journal)|International Affairs]]|volume=36 |issue=3|pages=310–321 |doi=10.2307/2610008|quote= |publisher=International Affairs (Royal Institute of International Affairs 1944–), Vol. 36, No. 3 |jstor= 2610008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;De Gaulle&lt;/span&gt; did so under the precondition that a new constitution would be introduced creating a powerful presidency in which a sole executive, the first of which was to be &lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;De Gaulle&lt;/span&gt;, ruled for seven-year periods. These changes were introduced and the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] was born.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6653">{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}
'''Hervé Gaymard''' (born 31 May 1960 in [[Bourg-Saint-Maurice]], Savoie) is a French politician and a member of [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] conservative party. He served as the country's [[Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industry (France)|Minister of Finances]] from 30 November 2004 until his resignation on 25 February 2005.  

Gaymard attended the ''[[Paris Institute of Political Studies|Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris]] (Sciences Po)'' and then at the ''[[École nationale d'administration]]'', graduating from the latter in 1986. After that he worked as a civil servant in a number of finance-related positions.

He was elected as a local councillor in Savoie's [[canton de Moûtiers]] in 1994. He later served on the departmental council of Savoie, and in 1999, became [[President of the general council|its president]]. He was appointed to the finance ministry in November 2004, and was forced to resign barely 12 weeks later, on Friday, 25 Feb 2005.

He is married to [[Clara Lejeune]], daughter of geniticist [[Jérôme Lejeune]]. A Catholic, he is the father of eight children: Philothée, Bérénice, Thaïs, Amédée, Eulalie, Faustine, Jérôme-Aristide, Angélico.

==Scandal==
Gaymard's resignation as Minister of Finances came after the satirical and investigative newspaper ''[[Le Canard enchaîné]]'' disclosed on 16 Feb 2005 that the government was funding an exclusive apartment for Gaymard and his family (his wife and his 8 children). The [[duplex]] apartment, located in the exclusive &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; neighbourhood off Paris' [[Champs-Élysées]], reportedly had an area of 600&amp;nbsp;m² (6460 sq ft) and cost the state a monthly rental of €14,000. Aside from the luxuriously high rent, the state was also funding $3,300 a month for maintenance and three parking spaces, $42,000 to renovate the apartment and the parking area, and $16,000 in real estate fees.

== Resignation ==

While Gaymard's actions were not illegal, the exposure of Gaymard's accepting lavish, state-funded perks, then attempting to lie in interviews, was bad news for the government at a time when the French public was asked to accept more economic sacrifices while reeling from a staggering unemployment rate that reached 10% in January, the highest level in over five years. Gaymard himself had said that the French should become &quot;detoxified&quot; of public spending. Curbing spending has been at the fore-front of Gaymard's office, giving hope to voters that the economy there would soon improve. And, as it was part of his responsibilities to regulate the housing market, he could not be unaware of the difficulties facing families seeking affordable accommodations. 

He resigned less than 5 hours before he was to give a televised interview defending his actions. In his issued statement, he said, &quot;I am aware that I committed blunders and, above all, a serious error of judgement…&quot;

Following this scandal, Prime Minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] tightened up the rules for public officials using state-funded apartments. However, the ''Canard'' soon revealed that Budget Minister [[Jean-François Copé]] also enjoyed an expensive apartment paid for by the state while he owned an apartment in Paris.

There has been some controversy regarding how the ''Canard'' and ''Libération'' had obtained such information. It was at some point suggested that they were orchestrated by [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], a political rival of Gaymard from the same party.

On August 26, 2005, Hervé Gaymard was reintegrated into the [[French Civil Service|civil service]] corps of the ''administrateurs civils'', with a ''hors-classe'' rank, and assigned to the Ministry of Finances (direction of the budget). ([http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=PRMG0570796A ministerial decision] in ''[[Journal Officiel de la République Française|Journal Officiel]]'', 13 September 2005; ''[[Le Monde]]'', 20 September 2005) after refunding the state the €58,894 that the refurbishing of his apartment had cost. Hervé Gaymard has previously announced that he considered working in the private sector. It is unknown, at this point, whether he considers going back to politics in the future.

The '''''Institut d'études politiques de Paris''''' ({{lang-en|Paris Institute of Political Studies}}), simply referred to as '''''Sciences Po''''' ({{IPA-fr|sijɑ̃s po}}), is a [[Établissement public à caractère scientifique, culturel et professionnel|public research and higher education institution]] in [[Paris]], [[France]], specialised in the [[social sciences]]. It has the status of ''[[grand établissement]]'', which allows its admissions process to be highly selective. Established in 1872, Sciences Po has traditionally educated France's political and diplomatic elite.

Its name refers to the political sciences, in the plural. Accordingly, its academic scope includes political science, as well as economics, history, sociology, law, finance, business, communication, social and urban policy, management and journalism. It offers several dual master’s degrees, in partnership with such institutions as the [[London School of Economics]], the [[Free University of Berlin]], the [[Hertie School of Governance]] in Berlin, the [[School of International and Public Affairs]] at [[Columbia University]], the [[Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy]] at the [[National University of Singapore]], the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]] and [[ESADE]]. At the undergraduate level, it also offers a dual degree program with the School of General Studies at [[Columbia University]]. 

The campus is located near the [[Seine River]], between [[Boulevard Saint Germain]] and [[Boulevard Raspail]]; within walking distance of most major sights, such as ''[[Notre Dame de Paris]]'', the ''[[Grand Palais]]'', the ''[[Panthéon]]'', and the ''[[Assemblée Nationale]]''. It is housed primarily in 17th and 18th century mansions located on the [[Rive Gauche|left bank]], on and around [[Rue Saint-Guillaume]], [[Rue des Saints Pères]] and [[Rue de l'Université]] (in the [[VIIe arrondissement|7th arondissement]]).

==History==
The name ''Sciences Po'' refers to three distinct, yet complementary institutions:
* ''[[École Libre des Sciences Politiques]]'', which was replaced in 1945 by :
** ''[[Fondation nationale des sciences politiques]]'' (''FNSP''), a research foundation; and
** ''[[Institut d'études politiques de Paris]]'' (''IEP de Paris''), a teaching institution.

===1872–1945===
[[Image:Émile Boutmy.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sciences Po Founder, Émile Boutmy.]]
''Sciences Po'' was established in February 1872 as the ''[[École Libre des Sciences Politiques]]'' by a group of French intellectuals, politicians and businessmen led by [[Émile Boutmy]], and including [[Hippolyte Taine]], [[Ernest Renan]], [[Albert Sorel]], [[Pierre Paul Leroy-Beaulieu|Paul Leroy Beaulieu]], and [[François Guizot]]. Following defeat in the 1870 war, the demise of [[Napoleon III]], and the [[Paris Commune]], these men sought to reform the training of French politicians. Politically and economically, people feared France's international stature was waning due to inadequate teaching of its political and diplomatic corps. ''ELSP'' was meant to serve as “the breeding ground where nearly all the major, non-technical state commissioners were trained.”&lt;ref name=&quot;purpose&quot;&gt;“Sciences Po 1945–1979” ''[http://chevs.sciences-po.fr/archives/fonds/sciences_po_2_en.htm Centre d’histoire de Sciences Po]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The school developed a [[humanistic]] and pragmatic teaching program: instructors included academics as well as ministers, high civil servants, and businessmen. New discipines such as [[International Relations]], [[International Law]], [[Political Economy]] and [[Comparative Government]] were introduced. In August 1894, the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] spoke out for the need to advance the study of politics along the lines of ''ELSP''. [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]] used the purpose and curriculum of ''Sciences Po'' as part of their inspiration for creating the [[London School of Economics]] in 1895.{{ref|Dahrendorf}}

===The situation since 1945===
As per ordinance 45-2284, issued by [[Charles de Gaulle]] on 9 October 1945, two entities were created from ''ELSP'': ''[[Fondation nationale des sciences politiques]]'' ({{lang-en|National Foundation of Political Science}}) or ''FNSP'' and ''Institut d'études politiques de Paris'' ({{lang-en|Paris Institute of Political Studies}}) or ''IEP Paris''.{{ref|1945ordinance}}  Both entities were tasked by the French government to ensure “the progress and the diffusion, both within and outside France, of political science, economics, and sociology”&lt;ref name=&quot;purpose&quot; /&gt;

The epithet ''Sciences Po'' was applied to both entities, which inherited the reputation previously vested in ''ELSP''.{{ref|duality}} France's Legislature entrusted ''FNSP'' with managing ''IEP Paris'', its library, and budget, and an administrative council assured the development of these activities. The curriculum and methodology of the ''ELSP'' were also the template for creating an entire system of institutes of political studies (French: [[Institut d'études politiques]]) across France, namely in Strasbourg, Lyon, Aix, Bordeaux, Grenoble, Toulouse, and then in Rennes and Lille. They are not to be confounded with Sciences Po's satellite campuses.

''FNSP'' further strengthened its role as a scientific publication center with significant donations from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. ''FNSP'' periodicals such as ''la Revue française de science politique'', ''le Bulletin analytique de documentation'', ''la Chronologie politique africaine'', and the ''Cahiers de la Fondation'' as well as its seven research centres and main publishing house, ''Presses de Sciences Po'', contribute to the reputation attained by ''Sciences Po'' research.&lt;ref name=&quot;purpose&quot; /&gt;

===Recent reforms===
''Sciences Po'' has undergone myriad reforms under [[Richard Descoings]], Director of ''Sciences Po'' (1997–present). ''Sciences Po'' has introduced a compulsory year abroad component to its undergraduate degree, and now offers a multilingual curriculum in French, English, and other languages. New educational sites have been set up in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[Dijon]], [[Poitiers]], [[Menton]], [[Le Havre]] and [[Reims]]. ''Sciences Po'' also set the length of its undergraduate program to three years and its graduate program to two years in line with the [[Bologna Process]].

''Sciences Po'' also implemented reforms in its admissions process. Previously, ''Sciences Po'' recruited its students almost exclusively from elite schools (mostly state-funded) in France, but in March 2001, the school's governing council widened its admissions policy.{{ref|NYUsource}} From September 2002, ''Sciences Po'' began accepting a small batch of students from certain schools located in economically depressed suburbs of Paris on the basis of their school record and a 45-minute interview, rather than the name-blind examination all other students must pass to be admitted. The reform is intended to broaden the socio-economic characteristics of ''Sciences Po'' student-body, and gained national and international media attention for being the first [[affirmative action]] experience in France, despite the initial controversy it brought up it is now broadly accepted by the French and considered a relative success. Moreover, ''Sciences Po'' introduced an alternative recruitment method -the so-called ''procédure internationale''- for foreign students or students with an international background, as they are not well prepared for the French written examination. ''Sciences Po'' also accepts a large contingent of graduate students from abroad without written exams.

===Rankings===
In September 2007, Sciences Po was rated the 8th best university in the world by the annual higher education survey conducted by the École des Mines de Paris thus placing it above both [[Oxford university|Oxford]] and [[Yale university|Yale]]. In 2008 Sciences Po ranked 11th, below Oxford and just above Yale,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ensmp.fr/Actualites/PR/EMP-ranking.html#7 |title=Professional Ranking of World Universities 2008 by MINES ParisTech |publisher=Ensmp.fr |accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2009 it ranked 15th.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mines-paristech.fr/Actualites/PR/EMP-ranking.pdf ]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ranking by the École des Mines asks CEOs of the 500 biggest multinational companies where they did their studies.

There are more than 70 clubs and organizations, such as [[PIMUN|Paris International Model United Nations]] and Sciences Po Finance (Finance society).

==Undergraduate program==
===Description===
In 2000, ''Sciences Po'' set the length of its undergraduate program to three years and the length of its graduate program to two years in line with the Bologna Process. The first three years of study are referred to as the ''premiers cycles'', which focuses on the full-range of the [[social sciences]], particularly [[public policy]], [[International Relations]], economics and [[political economy]], management studies, finance, [[geography]], constitutional and administrative law, [[philosophy]], and [[sociology]]. Students generally spend their third year of the ''premier cycle'' abroad, at one of Sciences Po's nearly 300 partner schools around the world. Students are, however, also given the option of spending the year interning for an institution related to their field of study. In addition to academics, ''Sciences Po'''s curriculum incorporates more practice-oriented skills like teamwork, effective oral communication and presentation skills, and nurturing leadership potential. Sciences Po's student-body is active, with more than seventy student clubs, councils, and organizations.

As of 2010, almost half of the student body was foreign. In recent years, ''Sciences Po'' has adopted a multi-lingual education policy: students are expected to be proficient in at least two foreign languages. More than one-third of classes are provided in languages others than French, including English, Spanish, German, and Italian. Currently, however, fluency in French is required for admission to most ''Sciences Po'' degrees.

===Satellite Campuses===
While all of Sciences Po's graduate programs are taught in Paris, the school has six additional undergraduate campuses in France. Each of the six campuses has its own distinct cultural identity and academic focus. They are designed to widen the academic concentration of the wider Sciences Po community, and allow students enrolled in the three-year Sciences Po undergraduate program, the collège universitaire, to specialize in a given region. Students who wish to study at either of the six satellite campuses usually need to apply through the Sciences Po admission services. Upon completing their undergraduate studies by spending a year abroad, all students usually move to Paris for their graduate studies (Master).

As the satellite campuses are part of Sciences Po Paris, their official designations always include the word &quot;Paris&quot; in order to distinguish them from the so-called &quot;IEP de province&quot;. For instance, Sciences Po Paris' Dijon campus is officially named Sciences Po Paris in Dijon:

These are 6 regional campuses:
:* '''French-German Undergraduate Program''' / [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] (created in 2000) :
The French-German Undergraduate Program is located in Nancy, which is at the centre of the Lorraine region of France, and maintains close ties to the German-speaking world given its proximity to the German border. Strasbourg and the European Parliament are also located nearby. This premier cycle focuses on the history of Franco-German relations, and its relevance for the future integration of the European continent. The main languages of instruction on campus are English, German, and French, and the student body is primarily made up of students from France and German-speaking countries.
:* '''European Undergraduate Program''' / [[Dijon]] (created 2001) :
The European Undergraduate Program is located in Dijon, which is the capital of the Burgundy region of France. The area is renowned for its winemaking and gastronomic heritage. A real Europe in miniature, the European Campus of Sciences Po welcomes students of more than twenty nationalities for the bachelor with a specific focus on the European Union and on the East Central European studies. This premier cycle initiates students into the challenges of the widened European Union, and Central European politics and history. Courses are taught in English and French, but students may also study at least one Central-European language (either Czech, Hungarian, Polish), italian (with an initiation of romanian) or russian.
:* '''Euro-Latin American Undergraduate Program''' / [[Poitiers]] (created 2001) :
[[Image:Sciences Po Poiters.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sciences Po Poitiers Campus.]]
The Ibero-American Undergraduate Program is located in Poitiers, a small city in western France. This premier cycle specializes in the politics and history of Iberia and Latin America. Courses are taught in French, Spanish, Portuguese, and English. The majority of students come from Spain, Portugal, and Latin America.
:* '''Middle Eastern and Mediterranean Undergraduate Program''' / [[Menton]] (created 2005):
The Middle Eastern and Mediterranean Undergraduate Program is located in Menton, a town on the French Riviera minutes from Monaco and the Italian border. This premier cycle gathers students from North Africa, the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, Israel, and all European nations. In particular, it focuses on the study of relationships between the northern and southern sides of the Mediterranean, as well as the analysis of the links between Europe and the Middle East. Courses are taught in French, English, and Arabic.
:* '''Euro-Asian Undergraduate Program''' / [[Le Havre]] (created 2007) :
The Euro-Asian Undergraduate Program is located in Le Havre, a city in Haute Normandy in northern France. The biggest port city of France, Le Havre, is UNESCO world heritage city. French/European students can learn Chinese, Japanese, Hindi, and Korean, in addition to English; while Asian students have to study French and one of the Asian languages, other than their mother-tongue. All courses during first year are in English, flavored with French in the background, to put the students at ease; but gradually moves towards French as the medium of instruction by the end second semester. It is therefore important to be able to speak, write, read and effectively communicate in French, else it can become quite challenging, especially when learning an Asian language is manadatory for all.
:* '''Euro-American Undergraduate Program''' / [[Reims]] (created 2009) :
The Euro-American Undergraduate Program in Reims, housed in a former Jesuit College, has opened its doors in September 2010 and  focuses on transatlantic relations. 45 minutes from Paris by train, Reims is famous for being the coronation site of the Kings of France and for its impressive Gallo-Roman heritage. Its rich past, its architecture ans its ancient Champagne producing tradition put this city of the Champagne-Ardennes region at the very heart of European and French history.

===Third Year abroad===
[[Richard Descoings]] has decided in the reforms he engaged at Sciences Po that every student should spend his third year abroad. Thanks to 350 university partners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.sciences-po.fr/en/partner-universities |title=Partner Universities , Sciences-Po International |publisher=International.sciences-po.fr |accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; students at Sciences Po have multiple possibilities. Students can also do an internship in a company, a cultural association, an embassy, etc.

==Master's degrees==
===Description===
Upon completion of the third year of undergraduate studies, students return to Paris for a two-year graduate program of their choosing leading to a Master's degree. Students from the school's undergraduate programs make up about half of the graduate programs' student population, the remainder having completed undergraduate studies elsewhere in France or abroad. Most programs are taught in more than one language though English-only programs are also available. Students can choose from a wide array of programs designed either by Sciences Po alone or in conjunction with other universities.

===Single Master's degrees===
The school's traditional &quot;single&quot; Master's degrees are suited for those seeking to develop professional skills in a specific area without losing the benefits of a generalist education. The curriculum generally comprises a set of generalist courses known as the &quot;tronc commun,&quot; specific courses related to the chosen field of study, and an internship semester.
:* '''[[International relations|International Affairs]]'''
:* '''European Affairs'''
:* '''Public Affairs''' (with a focus on France)
:* '''Urban Planning and Regional Studies'''
:* '''[[Law School]]'''
:* '''[[Human Resource Management]]'''
:* '''Finance and Strategy'''
:* '''Marketing'''
:* '''[[Journalism School]]'''
:* '''School of Communication'''
:* '''Economics and Public Policy''' in association with the Polytechnique and the ENSAE (School of Statistics) with support of Nobel Prize laureates such as Edmund Phelps, Joseph Stiglitz and Amartya Sen.

Students eyeing with an academic career can apply for admission into '''research-based programs''' with an additional focus on scientific methods. The requirement to gain work experience during the internship semester is replaced with a requirement to write a Master's thesis. The school has offered ''Master recherche'' programs in such fields as economic governance, theory of organisations, political theory, sociology, and history. However, as of early 2009, the school is overhauling all of its research-based programs.

===Dual Master's degrees===
Alternatively, students can apply for admission into one of the school's double degree programs designed in conjunction with partner universities in France and abroad. Students are awarded two degrees upon studying one year at each university. As the writing of a Master's thesis is often part of the graduation requirements at partner universities, dual programs can also be suited for those interested in an academic career.

Most recently, instructors included or still include former French Prime Minister [[Dominique de Villepin]], current WTO president [[Pascal Lamy]], former French Prime Minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]], former French foreign minister [[Hubert Védrine]], Nobel Prize Laureate economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]], former Lebanese Minister of Culture [[Ghassan Salame]] and former Economics minister as well as former Managing Director of IMF [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]]. These instructors are anchored by around 800 tenured professors

==Global Public Policy Network==
''Sciences Po'' offers dual master’s degrees with the [[London School of Economics]], the [[School of International and Public Affairs]] at [[Columbia University]], the [[Hertie School of Governance]] in Berlin, and the [[Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy]] at the [[National University of Singapore]]. This collaboration has existed since the early 1990s, but was formalized in September 2005 with the official launch of the Global Public Policy Network in Beijing, China. The partnership is meant to foster greater academic collaboration between students, faculty, and research centers of four leading public policy schools in what could arguably be termed four [[Global city|world capital cities]].{{ref|GPPN}} The network is further intended to facilitate collaboration on public policy research, student and faculty exchanges, and international conferences and fora with policymakers from the USA, Germany, UK, France and [[Singapore]]. This alliance has produced five degree programs with LSE, including masters degrees in [[International Relations]], [[Negotiation]], [[International Political Economy]], [[Public administration|Public Affairs]], the Practice of International Affairs, and [[Urban Policy]], two degree programs with Columbia, specifically a Master in [[International relations|International Affairs]], dual [[Master of Public Policy]] and [[Master of Public Administration]] with the [[Hertie School of Governance]], and a Master in Public Affairs, and one degree program with LKS, a Master in [[Public Policy]].{{ref|joint-degrees}}

==Research==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Iep.jpg|thumb|School Gardens{{speedy-image-c|14 March, unless its copyright status can be clarified}}]] --&gt;

===Doctoral School===
The Doctoral School is currently directed by [[Hervé Crès]] and includes 175 faculty members and 600 doctoral students. It was created in 1988 and welcomes students for their Master and PhD studies.

===Research Master's===

The Research Master’s program entails two years of interdisciplinary instruction in four basic social sciences: political science, history, sociology and economics. This interdisciplinary approach is designed to reinforce and round out graduate-level training. The Research Master’s program prepares students for doctoral studies and subsequent careers in research and higher education. But it also opens out into a wider range of career options (work in consulting, expertise, public opinion polling, publishing etc.) thanks to the links between the Sciences Po Master’s degree and Research Master’s programs in the form of joint courses and degrees.

The Research Master’s program offers:
* an outstanding academic framework
* close administrative support all the way through to entry into professional life
* openness and close links to outside academic and professional domains at national and international levels.

Students in the Research Master’s program can choose from among six concentrations: History and Theory of Politics, International Relations, Politics and Society in Europe, Comparative Politics, Sociology of Action, Economic Governance.
* History and Theory of Politics, with two specialities:
** History
** Political philosophy
* Comparative Politics with four specialities:
** Asia
** Latin America
** Muslim world
** Russia and CIS
* International relations with three specialities:
** Political science of international relations
** History of the international relations
** Economy of the international relations
* Economic Governance
* Politics and Society in Europe proposes four specialities:
** Sociological analysis of change
** Europe
** Public policy
** Political sociology
* Sociology of Action

===PhD Program===
Sciences Po is accredited to confer PhD degrees in economics, history, political science and sociology.

The Sciences Po PhD Program counts roughly 600 doctoral candidates, a third of whom hail from abroad. About 40 defend their dissertations each year. The program has a long-standing tradition of multi-disciplinary scholarship.

The PhD Program covers 15 fields of study, which follow up on those offered in the Master’s program: Latin America, Sociological Analysis of Change, Asia, Economics of International Relations, United States, Europe, International Finance, Economic Governance, History, Muslim World, Political Thought, Russia/CIS, Political Science of International Relations, Sociology of Action, Political Sociology and Public Policy.

In addition to academic training, the PhD Program provides a number of student services, including financial aid for PhD studies as well as for research abroad, support and promotion for publications, and job placement guidance and assistance.

===Habilitation===
Sciences Po awards a French postdoctoral degree called Habilitation qualifying the holder to supervise doctoral research in economics, history, political science and sociology.

Habilitation is the crowning degree for university studies in France: it attests to the holder’s high level of scholarship, the originality of their approach, the ability to master a research strategy in a sufficiently broad field of inquiry and to supervise young scholars. It qualifies the holder, moreover, to join the corps of university professors.

===Research centres===
''FNSP'' manages the research faculty and facilities of ''Sciences Po'', and is one of the largest [[social sciences]] research bodies in Europe. ''FNSP'' manages research centres, a doctoral school, a library and a publishing house. The FNSP manages eight research centres (five jointly with [[CNRS]]). The foundation of ''Sciences Po'' predates by a few decades the creation of [[political science]], as such the Institute focuses on all the social sciences that study the political field.

* [[History]]
** CHSP (''Centre d’histoire de Sciences Po'') directed by [[Jean-François Sirinelli]]
* [[Sociology]]
** OSC (''Observatoire sociologique du changement'') directed by [[Alain Chenu]]
** CSO (''Centre de Sociologie des organisations'') directed by [[Christine Musselin]]
* [[Economics]]. The Department of Economics at Sciences Po is directed by [[Philippe Martin (economist)|Philippe Martin]]. It is constituted of two research centers:
** GEM (''Groupe d'économie mondiale'') directed by [[Patrick Messerlin]]
** OFCE (''Observatoire français des conjonctures économiques'') directed by [[Philippe Weil]]
* [[International Relations]]
** CERI (''Centre d’études et de recherches internationales'') directed by [[Christian Lequesne]]
** CEE (''Centre d’études européennes de Sciences Po'') directed by [[Renaud Dehousse]]
* [[Political Science]] in France and Europe
** CEVIPOF (''Centre d’étude de la vie politique française'') directed by [[Pascal Perrineau]]
** CDSP (''Centre de données sociopolitiques de Sciences Po'') directed by [[Alain Chenu]]

===Research networks===
* EUREDOCS : European Research &amp; Higher Education Doctoral Studies network:
Euredocs is a network run by Sciences Po made up of doctoral students and recent PhD recipients (who have defended their dissertations within the past three years). The network addresses the Europeanization of higher education and research, including such issues as the structure of academic curricula, evaluation/accreditation procedures, changes in national education policies and university governance, academic career patterns, the production of knowledge, the impact of internationalization/globalization etc.
* GARNET Network of Excellence : “Global Governance, Regionalisation and Regulation: The Role of the EU”
Funded under the European Commission’s 6th Framework Programme, the GARNET network gathers 42 leading research centres and universities in Europe and operates with a budget of 5,4 millions euros over 5 years (2005–2010). Sciences Po is represented in the network by CERI who runs a specific “dissemination of excellence” programme. A number of GARNET activities address doctoral students and finance their participation:
** PhD School Network develops interdisciplinary seminar programmes focusing on key theoretical and methodological issues on global governance and the role of the EU. These one-week seminars bring together professors and PhD students from all over Europe and the world;
** Research programmes are particularly welcoming participation of doctoral students, namely 18 Jointly Executed Research Projects, the “Capacity Building in Professional Training on Issues of Global Governance and Regulation” program and GARNET Annual Conferences;
** Mobility programme offers up to 1,500 Euros/ month allowance to doctoral students at the later stages of their dissertation wishing to participate in the research activities of GARNET partner institutions for short or long period.
* Connex Network of Excellence on Efficient and Democratic Governance in a Multi-level Europe:
CONNEX is a network set up under the 6th Framework Programme for European Research and Technological Development (2002–2006) to analyze various facets of democratic governance in Europe.

==Library and publishing==
===Library (Bibliothèque de Sciences Po)===
Founded in 1871, the nucleus of the school’s research is ''Bibliothèque de Sciences Po'', which &quot;houses&quot; 650,000 books about [[social sciences]] and 4,500 journals and annual publications, although only approximately one fifteenth of these is available to students at any given time. The ''Bibliothèque'' is also the hub of the Documentary Service which maintains 18,000 press dossiers on a wide range of sub-topics, and which each years abstracts and indexes some 10,000 articles from 1,200 periodicals each year.{{ref|Biblio}} In 1982, the [[National Ministry of Education (France)|National Ministry of Education]] made the ''Bibliothèque'' the Centre for Acquisition and Dissemination of Scientific and Technical Information in the field of [[political science]], and since 1994, it has been the antenna associated with ''[[Bibliothèque Nationale de France]]''.{{ref|Sciences-Po-Paris}} ''Bibliothèque de Sciences Po'' is also the main French partner in the [[International Bibliography of the Social Sciences]], which is based at the [[London School of Economics]].{{ref|IBSS}}

'''Jacques René Chirac''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ʒ|ɑː|k|_|ʃ|ɨ|ˈ|r|æ|k}}; {{IPA-fr|ʒɑk ʃiʁak}}; born 29 November 1932) is a French politician who served as [[President of France]] from 1995 to 2007. He previously served as [[Prime Minister of France]] from 1974 to 1976 and from 1986 to 1988 (making him the only person to hold the position of Prime Minister twice under the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]]), and as [[List of mayors of Paris|Mayor of Paris]] from 1977 to 1995.

Chirac was briefly a Communist in his late teens. After completing his studies of the [[DEA (former French degree)|DEA]]'s degree at the [[Institut d'études politiques de Paris]], a term at [[Harvard University]] and the [[École nationale d'administration]] (ENA), Chirac began his career as a high-level civil servant, and soon entered politics. He subsequently occupied various senior positions, including [[Minister of Agriculture (France)|Minister of Agriculture]], [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]], Prime Minister, [[Mayor of Paris]], and finally [[President of the French Republic]].

Chirac's internal policies included lower tax rates, the removal of [[price controls]], strong punishment for crime and terrorism, and business [[privatisation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/1997/07/15/chirac.t.php Privatization Is Essential, Chirac Warns Socialists: Resisting Global Currents, France Sticks to Being French], ''International Herald Tribune''&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued for more socially responsible [[economic policies]], and was elected in 1995 after campaigning on a platform of healing the &quot;social rift&quot; (''fracture sociale'').&lt;ref name=Bonjour&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonjourlafrance.net/france-history/jacques-chirac.htm |title=Jacques Chirac President of France from 1995–2007 |publisher=Bonjourlafrance.net |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After less statist policy when he was Prime Minister (1986–1988), he changed his method. Then, his economic policies, based on ''[[dirigisme]]'', state-directed ideals, stood in opposition to the ''[[laissez-faire]]'' policies of the United Kingdom, which Chirac famously described as &quot;[[Anglosphere|Anglo-Saxon]] [[neoliberalism|ultraliberalism]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite book|last=Giavazzi|first=Francesco|coauthors=Alberto Alesina|year=2006|title=The Future of Europe: Reform Or Decline|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chirac is the second-longest serving President of France (two full terms, the first of seven years and the second of five years), after [[François Mitterrand]]. As President, he also served as an ''[[ex officio]]'' [[Co-Prince of Andorra]] and Grand Master of the French [[Légion d'honneur]].

On 15 December 2011, the Paris court declared him guilty of diverting public funds and abusing public confidence, and gave Chirac a two-year suspended prison sentence.

==Family, early life, education, and early career==
Chirac, born in the Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire clinic ([[5th arrondissement of Paris|Paris V&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;]]), is the son of Abel François Chirac (1893–1968), a successful executive for an aircraft company,&lt;ref name=Bonjour /&gt; and Marie-Louise Valette (1902–1973), a housewife. His great grandparents on both sides were [[peasant]]s, but his two grandfathers were teachers from [[Sainte-Féréole]] in Corrèze. According to Chirac, his name &quot;originates from the [[langue d'oc]], that of the troubadours, therefore that of poetry&quot;. He is a Roman Catholic.

Chirac was an only child (his elder sister, Jacqueline, died in infancy before his birth), and was educated in Paris at the [[Lycée Carnot]] and at the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]]. After his [[baccalauréat]], he served for three months as a sailor on a coal-transporter.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Chirac played [[rugby union]] for [[CA Brive|Brive]]'s youth team, and also played at university level. He played no. 8 and second row.&lt;ref name=Famous&gt;[http://wesclark.com/rrr/famous.html Famous Ruggers by Wes Clark and others]. Retrieved 19 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, he married [[Bernadette Chirac|Bernadette Chodron de Courcel]], with whom he had two daughters: Laurence (born 4 March 1958) and Claude (14 January 1962).

[[File:Jacques chirac corrèze 2.jpg|thumb|left|Chirac (right) in the 1960s]]
Inspired by General [[Charles de Gaulle]], Chirac started to pursue a civil service career in the 1950s. During this period, he joined the [[French Communist Party]], sold copies of ''[[L'Humanité]]'', and took part in meetings of a communist cell.&lt;ref name=d&gt;''[[France 3]]'', 12 November 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, he signed the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-inspired [[Stockholm Appeal]] for the abolition of [[nuclear weapons]] – which led him to be questioned when he applied for his first visa to the United States.&lt;ref name=e&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080608185416/http://www.humanite.fr/1995-05-08_Articles_-Jacques-Chirac-sabre-au-clair Jacques Chirac, sabre au clair]. ''L'Humanité'' 8 May 1995 (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, after graduating from &quot;[[Sciences Po]]&quot; (more formally known as the [[Paris Institute of Political Studies]]), he attended [[Harvard University]]'s summer school, before entering the ENA, the [[Grandes écoles|Grande école]] [[École nationale d'administration|National School of Administration]], which trains France's top civil servants, in 1957.

Chirac trained as a reserve military officer in [[armoured warfare|armoured cavalry]] at [[Saumur]], where he was ranked first in his year.&lt;ref name=f&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20061123131215/http://gouvernement.fr/acteurs/premier_ministre/histoire_chefs_gouvernement_28/jacques_chirac_55/ La biographie de Jacques Chirac]. Portail du Gouvernement – site du Premier ministre. 27 July 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He then volunteered to fight in the [[Algerian War]], using personal connections to be sent despite the reservations of his superiors. His superiors did not want to make him an officer because they suspected he had communist leanings.&lt;ref name=g&gt;Emmanuel Hecht and François Vey ''Chirac de A à Z, dictionnaire critique et impertinent'', A. Michel, 1995, ISBN 2226076646&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving the ENA in 1959, he became a civil servant in the Court of Auditors.

==Early political career, Cabinet Minister==
In April 1962, Chirac was appointed head of the personal staff of Prime Minister [[Georges Pompidou]]. This appointment launched Chirac's political career. Pompidou considered Chirac his [[protégé]], and referred to him as &quot;my bulldozer&quot; for his skill at getting things done. The nickname &quot;Le Bulldozer&quot; caught on in French political circles. Chirac still maintains this reputation. In 1995 an anonymous British diplomat said Chirac &quot;cuts through the crap and comes straight to the point...It's refreshing, although you have to put your seat belt on when you work with him&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

At Pompidou's suggestion, Chirac ran as a [[Gaullist]] for a seat in the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] in 1967. He was elected deputy for his home [[Corrèze]] ''département'', a stronghold of the left. This surprising victory in the context of a Gaullist ebb permitted him to enter the government as [[Minister of Social Affairs (France)|Minister of Social Affairs]]. Although Chirac was well-situated in de Gaulle's entourage, being related by marriage to the general's sole companion at the time of the [[Appeal of 18 June]] 1940, he was more of a &quot;Pompidolian&quot; than a &quot;Gaullist&quot;. When student and worker unrest rocked France in [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]], Chirac played a central role in negotiating a truce. Then, as state secretary of economy (1968–1971), he worked closely with [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]], who headed the ministry of economy and finance.

After some months in the ministry of relations with Parliament, Chirac's first high-level post came in 1972 when he became [[Minister of Agriculture (France)|Minister of Agriculture]] and Rural Development under Pompidou, who had been elected president in 1969, after de Gaulle retired. Chirac quickly earned a reputation as a champion of French farmers' interests, and first attracted international attention when he assailed U.S., [[West German]], and [[European Commission]] agricultural policies which conflicted with French interests.

On 27 February 1974, after the resignation of [[Raymond Marcellin]], Chirac was appointed [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]]. On 21 March 1974, he cancelled the [[SAFARI]] project due to privacy concerns after its existence was revealed by ''[[Le Monde]]''. From March 1974, he was entrusted by President Pompidou with preparations for the presidential election then scheduled for 1976. These elections were moved forward because of Pompidou's sudden death on 2 April 1974.

Chirac vainly attempted to rally Gaullists behind Prime minister [[Pierre Messmer]]. [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]] announced his candidacy in spite of the disapproval of the &quot;Pompidolians&quot;. Chirac and others published the ''call of the 43'' in favour of Giscard d'Estaing, the leader of the non-Gaullist part of the parliamentary majority. Giscard d'Estaing was elected as Pompidou's successor after France's most competitive election campaign in years. In return, the new president chose Chirac to lead the cabinet.

==Prime Minister (1974–1976)==
When [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing|Giscard]] became president, he nominated Chirac as [[Prime Minister of France|prime minister]] on 27 May 1974, in order to reconcile the &quot;Giscardian&quot; and &quot;non-Giscardian&quot; factions of the parliamentary majority. At the age of 41, Chirac stood out as the very model of the ''jeunes loups'' (&quot;young wolves&quot;) of French politics, but he was faced with the hostility of the &quot;Barons of Gaullism&quot; who considered him a traitor for his role during the previous presidential campaign. In December 1974, he took the lead of the [[Gaullist Party|Union of Democrats for the Republic]] (UDR) against the will of its more senior personalities.

As prime minister, Chirac quickly set about persuading the Gaullists that, despite the social reforms proposed by President Giscard, the basic tenets of Gaullism, such as national and European independence, would be retained. Chirac was advised by [[Pierre Juillet]] and [[Marie-France Garaud]], two former advisers of Pompidou. These two organised the campaign against Chaban-Delmas in 1974. They advocated a clash with Giscard d'Estaing because they thought his policy bewildered the conservative electorate. Citing Giscard's unwillingness to give him authority, Chirac resigned as Prime Minister in 1976. He proceeded to build up his political base among France's several conservative parties, with a goal of reconstituting the Gaullist UDR into a neo-Gaullist group, the Rally for the Republic (RPR).

==Osirak controversy==
At the invitation of [[Saddam Hussein]] (then vice-president of [[Iraq]], but ''de facto'' dictator), Chirac made an official visit to [[Baghdad]] in 1975. Saddam approved a deal granting French oil companies a number of privileges plus a 23 per cent share of Iraqi oil.&lt;ref name=h&gt;Taheri, Amir, [http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-taheri110402.asp &quot;The Chirac Doctrine: France’s Iraq-war plan&quot;], ''National Review Online'', 4 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this deal, France sold Iraq the [[Osirak]] MTR [[nuclear reactor]], a type designed to test nuclear materials.

The [[Israeli Air Force]] alleged that the reactor's imminent commissioning was a threat to its security, and pre-emptively bombed the Osirak reactor on 7 June 1981, provoking considerable anger from French officials and the United Nations Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/7/newsid_3014000/3014623.stm &quot;1981: Israel bombs Baghdad nuclear reactor&quot;], ''On this day – 7 June'', BBC News, Retrieved: 5 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Osirak deal became a controversy again in 2002–2003, when an international [[Multi-National Force – Iraq|military coalition]] led by the United States [[rationale for the Iraq War|invaded Iraq]] and forcibly removed Hussein's government from power. France led several other European countries in an effort to prevent the invasion. The Osirak deal was then used by parts of the American media to criticise the Chirac-led [[opposition to the Iraq War|opposition to starting a war in Iraq]],&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Glenn, [http://www.boston.com/news/packages/iraq/globe_stories/030203_chirac.htm Rebuilding Iraq], ''[[Boston Globe]]'', 2 March 2003&lt;/ref&gt; despite French involvement in the [[Gulf War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/2007/MR629.pdf |title=Out of Area or Out of Reach? European Military Support for Operations in Southwest Asia |format=PDF |accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mayor of Paris (1977–1995)==
After his departure from the cabinet, Chirac wanted to gain the leadership of the political right, in order to gain the French presidency in the future. The RPR was conceived as an electoral machine against President Giscard d'Estaing. Paradoxically, Chirac benefited from Giscard's decision to create the office of mayor in Paris, which had been in abeyance since the 1871 [[Paris Commune|Commune]], because the leaders of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] (1871–1940) feared that having municipal control of the capital would give the mayor too much power. In 1977, Chirac stood as a candidate against [[Michel d'Ornano]], a close friend of the president, and he won. As mayor of Paris, Chirac's political influence grew. He held this post until 1995.

Chirac supporters point out that, as mayor, he provided programs to help the elderly, people with disabilities, and single mothers, and introduced the street-cleaning [[Motocrotte]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/apr/12/worlddispatch.jonhenley|title=Merde most foul|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=12 April 2002|accessdate=29 July 2010  | first=Jon | last=Henley}}&lt;/ref&gt; while providing incentives for businesses to stay in Paris. His opponents contend that he installed &quot;clientelist&quot; policies.

===Accused of corruption, convicted===
Chirac has been named in several cases of alleged corruption that occurred during his term as mayor, some of which have led to [[felony]] convictions of some politicians and aides. However, a controversial judicial decision in 1999 granted Chirac immunity while he was president of France. He refused to testify on these matters, arguing that it would be incompatible with his presidential functions. Investigations concerning the running of Paris's city hall, the number of whose municipal employees jumped by 25% from 1977 to 1995 (with 2,000 out of approximately 35,000 coming from the Corrèze region where Chirac had held his seat as deputy), as well as a lack of financial transparency (''marchés publics'') and the communal debt, were thwarted by the legal impossibility of questioning him as president. The conditions of the [[privatisation]] of the Parisian water network, acquired very cheaply by the [[Compagnie Générale des Eaux|Générale]] and the [[Suez Environnement|Lyonnaise des Eaux]], then directed by [[Jérôme Monod]], a close friend of Chirac, were also criticised. Furthermore, the satirical newspaper ''[[Le Canard enchaîné]]'' revealed the astronomical &quot;food expenses&quot; paid by the Parisian municipality (€15 million a year according to the ''Canard''), expenses managed by [[Roger Romani]] (who allegedly destroyed all archives of the period 1978–1993 during night raids in 1999–2000). Thousands of people were invited each year to receptions in the Paris city hall, while many political, media and artistic personalities were hosted in private flats owned by the city.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Guarrigues, professor at the University of [[Orléans]] (and author of ''Les Scandales de la République. De Panama à l'Affaire Elf'', Robert Laffon, 2004), &quot;La dérive des affaires&quot; in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n° 313, October 2006, pp. 66–71 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chirac's immunity from prosecution ended in May 2007, when he left office as president. In November 2007 a preliminary charge of misuse of public funds was filed against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/chirac-faces-investigation-into-misuse-of-public-cash-759026.html|title=Chirac faces investigation into 'misuse of public cash'|date=22 November 2007|work=The Independent |location=London  |accessdate=6 July 2008  | first=John | last=Lichfield}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chirac is said to be the first former French head of state to be formally placed under investigation for a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.capital.fr/Actualite/Default.asp?source=RE&amp;numero=270226&amp;Cat=GEN|title=Le dossier judiciaire de Jacques Chirac s'alourdit|date=22 February 2008|work=Capital.fr|accessdate=6 July 2008|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 October 2009, a judge ordered Chirac to stand trial on [[embezzlement]] charges, dating back to his time as mayor of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/31/world/europe/31chirac.html|title=Frances Chirac Ordered to Face Trial|date=30 October 2009|author=Alan Cowell|work=The New York Times|accessdate=30 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 December 2011, Chirac was found guilty in two related cases, involving 19 totally or partially fake jobs created for his benefit by the RPR Party, which he led as Paris mayor from 1977 to 1995. He was convicted of embezzling public funds, abuse of trust, and illegal [[conflict of interest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/french-ex-president-chirac-convicted-of-corruption/2011/12/15/gIQAfp97vO_story.html|author=Edward Cody|title=Former French leader Jacques Chirac convicted of corruption for his Paris mayor days|date=16 December 2011|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Struggle for the right-wing leadership==
In 1978, he attacked the [[pro-European]] policy of [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] (VGE), and made a nationalist turn with the December 1978 [[Call of Cochin]], initiated by his counsellors [[Marie-France Garaud]] and [[Pierre Juillet]], which had first been called by Pompidou. Hospitalised in Cochin hospital after a crash, he declared that &quot;as always about the drooping of France, the pro-foreign party acts with its peaceable and reassuring voice&quot;. He appointed [[Ivan Blot]], an intellectual who would later join the [[National Front (France)|National Front]], as director of his campaigns for the [[European Parliament elections, 1979|1979 European election]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Slama&quot;&gt;[[:fr:Alain-Gérard Slama|Alain-Gérard Slama]], &quot;Vous avez dit bonapartiste?&quot; in ''L'Histoire'' n°313, October 2006, pp.60–63 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the poor results of the election, Chirac broke with Garaud and Juillet. His rivalry with Giscard d'Estaing intensified. Although it has been often interpreted by historians as the struggle between two rival French right-wing families (the [[Bonapartist]]s, represented by Chirac, and the [[Orleanist]]s, represented by VGE), both figures in fact were members of the Liberal, Orleanist tradition, according to historian Alain-Gérard Slama.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slama&quot;/&gt; But the eviction of the Gaullist Barons and of President VGE convinced Chirac to assume a strong neo-Gaullist stance.

Chirac made his first run for president against Giscard d'Estaing in the [[French presidential election, 1981|1981 election]], thus splitting the centre-right vote. He was eliminated in the first round with 18% of the vote. He reluctantly supported Giscard in the second round. He refused to give instructions to the RPR voters but said that he supported the incumbent president &quot;in a private capacity&quot;, which was almost like a ''de facto'' support of the [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]]'s (PS) candidate, [[François Mitterrand]], who was elected by a broad majority.

Giscard has always blamed Chirac for his defeat. He was told by Mitterrand, before his death, that the latter had dined with Chirac before the election. Chirac told the Socialist candidate that he wanted to &quot;get rid of Giscard&quot;. In his memoirs, Giscard wrote that between the two rounds, he phoned the RPR headquarters. He passed himself off as a right-wing voter by changing his voice. The RPR employee advised him &quot;certainly do not vote Giscard!&quot;. After 1981, the relationship between the two men became tense, with Giscard, even though he was in the same government coalition as Chirac, criticising Chirac's actions openly.

After the May 1981 presidential election, the right also lost the subsequent [[French legislative election, 1981|legislative election]] that year. However, as Giscard had been knocked out, Chirac appeared as the principal leader of the right-wing opposition. Due to his attacks against the economic policy of the Socialist government, he gradually aligned himself with prevailing economic liberal opinion, even though it did not correspond with Gaullist doctrine. While the far-right National Front grew, taking advantage of a [[proportional representation]] electoral law, he signed an electoral platform with the Giscardian (and more or less Christian Democrat) party [[Union for French Democracy]] (UDF).

==First &quot;cohabitation&quot; (1986–1988) and &quot;desert crossing&quot;==
[[File:Jacques Chirac mid-eighties.jpg|thumb|Chirac during his second term as Prime Minister]]
When the RPR/UDF right-wing coalition won a slight majority in the National Assembly in the [[French legislative election, 1986|1986 election]], Mitterrand (PS) appointed Chirac prime minister (though many in Mitterrand's inner circle lobbied him to choose [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]] instead). This unprecedented power-sharing arrangement, known as [[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]], gave Chirac the lead in domestic affairs. However, it is generally conceded that Mitterrand used the areas granted to the President of the Republic, or &quot;reserved domains&quot; of the Presidency, Defense and Foreign Affairs, to belittle his Prime Minister.

===Chirac's second ministry===
(20 March 1986 – 12 May 1988)
*'''Jacques Chirac''' – Prime Minister
*[[Jean-Bernard Raimond]] – Minister of Foreign Affairs
*[[André Giraud]] – Minister of Defence
*[[Charles Pasqua]] – Minister of the Interior
*[[Édouard Balladur]] – Minister of Economy, Finance, and Privatisation
*[[Alain Madelin]] – Minister of Industry, Tourism, Posts, and Telecommunications
*[[Philippe Séguin]] – Minister of Employment and Social Affairs
*[[Albin Chalandon]] – Minister of Justice
*[[René Monory]] – Minister of National Education
*[[François Léotard]] – Minister of Culture and Communications
*[[François Guillaume]] – Minister of Agriculture
*[[Bernard Pons]] – Minister of Overseas Departments and Territories
*[[Pierre Méhaignerie]] – Minister of Housing, Equipment, Regional Planning, and Transport
*[[André Rossinot]] – Minister of Relations with Parliament
*[[Michel Aurillac]] – Minister of Cooperation

Chirac's cabinet sold many public companies, renewing with the [[liberalisation]] initiated under [[Laurent Fabius]]'s Socialist government (1984–86 – in particular with Fabius' privatisation of the audiovisual sector, leading to the creation of [[Canal +]]), and abolished the [[solidarity tax on wealth]] (ISF), a symbolic tax on very high resources championed by Mitterrand's government. Elsewhere, the plan for university reform (plan Devaquet) caused a crisis in 1986 when a young man named [[Malik Oussekine]] (1964–1986) was killed by the police, leading to massive demonstrations and the proposal's withdrawal. It has been said during other student crises that this event strongly affected Jacques Chirac, who was hereafter careful about possible [[police violence]] during such demonstrations (i.e. maybe explaining part of the decision to &quot;promulgate without applying&quot; the [[First Employment Contract]] (CPE) after [[2006 labor protests in France|large student demonstrations against it]]).

One of his first acts concerning foreign policy was to call back [[Jacques Foccart]] (1913–1997), who had been de Gaulle's and his successors' leading counsellor for African matters, called by journalist [[Stephen Smith (journalist)|Stephen Smith]] the &quot;father of all &quot;networks&quot; on the continent, at the time [in 1986] aged 72.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;&quot;Naufrage de la [[Françafrique]] – Le président a poursuivi une politique privilégiant les hommes forts au pouvoir.&quot;, [[Stephen Smith (journalist)|Stephen Smith]] in ''L'Histoire'' n°313, October 2006 (special issue on Chirac), p.70 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacques Foccart, who had also co-founded the Gaullist ''[[Service d'Action Civique]]'' (SAC, dissolved by Mitterrand in 1982) along with Charles Pasqua, and who was a key component of the &quot;[[Françafrique]]&quot; system, was again called to the [[Elysée Palace]] when Chirac won the 1995 presidential election. Furthermore, confronted by [[anti-colonialism|anti-colonialist movements]] in [[New Caledonia]], Prime Minister Chirac ordered a military intervention against the separatists in the Ouvéa cave, leading to several tragic deaths. He allegedly refused any alliance with [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]'s ''Front National''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/04/24/1019441263037.html |title=Chirac labels 'racist' Le Pen as threat to nation's soul |work=The Age |location=Australia |date=25 April 2002 |accessdate=20 April 2010 | first=Harry | last=de Quetteville}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1988 presidential elections and afterwards===
Chirac ran against Mitterrand for a second time in the [[French presidential election, 1988|1988 election]]. He obtained 20 percent of the vote in the first round, but lost the second with only 46 percent. He resigned from the cabinet and the right lost the [[French legislative election, 1988|next legislative election]].

For the first time, his leadership over the RPR was challenged. [[Charles Pasqua]] and [[Philippe Séguin]] criticised his abandonment of Gaullist doctrines. On the right, a new generation of politicians, the &quot;renovation men&quot;, accused Chirac and Giscard of being responsible for the electoral defeats. In 1992, convinced a man could not become President whilst advocating anti-European policies, he called for a &quot;yes&quot; vote in the referendum on the [[Maastricht Treaty]], against the opinion of Pasqua, Séguin and a majority of the RPR voters, who chose to vote &quot;no&quot;.

While he still was mayor of Paris (since 1977), Chirac went to [[Abidjan]] (Côte d'Ivoire) where he supported [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny|President Houphouët-Boigny]] (1960–1993), although the latter was being called a &quot;thief&quot; by the local population. Chirac then declared that [[multiparty democracy|multipartism]] was a &quot;kind of luxury.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;&quot;Naufrage de la Françafrique – Le président a poursuivi une politique privilégiant les hommes forts au pouvoir.&quot;, Stephen Smith in ''L'Histoire'' n°313, October 2006 (special issue on Chirac), p.70 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the right won the [[French legislative election, 1993|1993 legislative election]]. Chirac announced that he did not want to come back as prime minister, suggesting the appointment of [[Edouard Balladur]], who had promised that he would not run for the presidency against Chirac in 1995. However, benefiting from positive polls, Balladur decided to be a presidential candidate, with the support of a majority of right-wing politicians. Chirac broke at that time with a number of friends and allies, including Charles Pasqua, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], etc., who supported Balladur's candidacy. A small group of &quot;fidels&quot; would remain with him, including [[Alain Juppé]] and [[Jean-Louis Debré]]. When Nicolas Sarkozy became President in 2007, Juppé was one of the few &quot;chiraquiens&quot; to serve in François Fillon's government.

==First term as President (1995–2002)==
[[Image:Clintonchirac.jpg|thumb|left|Chirac with [[Bill Clinton]] outside the [[Élysée Palace]] in Paris, June 1999]]

During the [[French presidential election, 1995|1995 presidential campaign]], Chirac criticised the &quot;sole thought&quot; (''[[pensée unique]]'') of [[neoliberalism]] represented by his challenger on the right and promised to reduce the &quot;social fracture&quot;, placing himself more to the center and thus forcing Balladur to [[Political radicalism|radicalise]] himself. Ultimately, he obtained more votes than Balladur in the first round (20.8 percent), and then defeated the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] candidate [[Lionel Jospin]] in the second round (52.6 percent).

Chirac was elected on a platform of tax cuts and job programs, but his policies did little to ease the labor strikes during his first months in office. On the domestic front, neo-liberal economic austerity measures introduced by Chirac and his conservative prime minister [[Alain Juppé]], including budgetary cutbacks, proved highly unpopular. At about the same time, it became apparent that Juppé and others had obtained preferential conditions for public housing, as well as other perks. At the year's end Chirac faced [[1995 strikes in France|major workers' strikes]] which turned itself, in November–December 1995, into a [[general strike]], one of the largest since May 1968. The demonstrations were largely pitted against Juppé's plan on the reform of pensions, and led to the dismissal of the latter.

Shortly after taking office, Chirac{{ndash}} undaunted by international protests by environmental groups{{ndash}} insisted upon the resumption of [[nuclear weapons and France|nuclear tests at Mururoa Atoll]] in [[French Polynesia]] in 1995, a few months before signing the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acronym.org.uk/a09comp.htm |title=Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty |publisher=Acronym.org.uk |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reacting to criticism, Chirac said, &quot;You only have to look back at 1935...There were people then who were against France arming itself, and look what happened.&quot; On 1 February 1996, Chirac announced that France had ended &quot;once and for all&quot; its nuclear testing, intending to accede to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

Elected as President of the Republic, he refused to discuss the existence of French military bases in Africa, despite requests by the Ministry of Defence and the ''[[Quai d'Orsay]]'' (Ministry of Foreign Affairs).&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot; /&gt; The French Army thus remained in Côte d'Ivoire as well as in [[Omar Bongo]]'s [[Gabon]].

[[Image:Bush and Chirac.jpg|thumb|Chirac and [[George W. Bush]] during the [[27th G8 summit]], 21 July 2001.]]

In 1997, Chirac dissolved parliament for early legislative elections in a gamble designed to bolster support for his conservative economic program. But instead, it created an uproar, and his power was weakened by the subsequent backlash. The Socialist Party (PS), joined by other parties on the left, soundly defeated Chirac's conservative allies, forcing Chirac into a new period of cohabitation with Jospin as prime minister (1997–2002), which lasted five years.

Cohabitation significantly weakened the power of Chirac's presidency. The French president, by a [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]], only controls foreign and military policy— and even then, allocation of funding is under the control of Parliament and under the significant influence of the prime minister. Short of dissolving parliament and calling for new elections, the president was left with little power to influence public policy regarding crime, the economy, and public services. Chirac seized the occasion to periodically criticise Jospin's government.

Nevertheless, his position was weakened by [[Corruption scandals in the Paris region|scandals about the financing of RPR by Paris municipality]]. In 2001, the left, represented by [[Bertrand Delanoë]] (PS), won over the majority in the town council of the capital. [[Jean Tiberi]], Chirac's successor at the Paris townhall, was forced to resign after having been put under investigations in June 1999 on charges of ''[[influence peddling|trafic d'influences]]'' in the [[HLM]]s of Paris affairs (related to the illegal financing of the RPR). Tiberi was finally expelled from the [[Rally for the Republic|RPR]], Chirac's party, on 12 October 2000, declaring to the ''[[Le Figaro|Figaro magazine]]'' on 18 November 2000: &quot;Jacques Chirac is not my friend anymore&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Rien ne va plus entre Chirac et Tiberi&quot;, ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 18 November 2000 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the publication of the [[Jean-Claude Méry|Méry video-tape]] by ''[[Le Monde]]'' on 22 September 2000, in which Jean-Claude Méry, in charge of the RPR's financing, directly accused Chirac of organizing the network, and of having been physically present on 5 October 1986, when Méry gave in cash 5 millions [[Franc]]s, which came from companies who had benefited from state deals, to [[Michel Roussin]], personal secretary (''directeur de cabinet'') of Chirac,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=101715 &quot;Un témoignage pour l'histoire&quot;], ''Le Monde'', 22 September 2000 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/recherche_breve/1,13-0,37-101887,0.html La suite du testament de Jean-Claude Méry], ''Le Monde'', 23 September 2000 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chirac refused to follow up his summons by judge [[Eric Halphen]], and the highest echelons of the French justice declared that he could not been inculpated while in functions.

During his two terms, he increased the Elysee Palace's total budget by 105 percent (currently €90&amp;nbsp;million, whereas 20 years ago it was the equivalent of €43.7&amp;nbsp;million). He doubled the number of presidential cars – nowadays there are 61 cars and seven scooters in the Palace's garage. He has hired 145 extra employees – the total number of the people he employed simultaneously was 963.

===Defence policy===
As the Supreme Commander of the French armed forces, he has reduced the French military budget, as did his predecessor.

==Second term as president (2002–2007)==
{{Main|Jacques Chirac's second term as President of France}}

At the age of 69, Chirac faced his fourth presidential campaign in 2002. He received just 20% of the vote in the first ballot of the [[French presidential elections, 2002|presidential elections]] in April 2002. It had been expected that he would face incumbent prime minister [[Lionel Jospin]] (PS) in the second round of elections; instead, Chirac faced controversial far right politician [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] of [[National Front (France)|National Front]] (FN) who came in 200,000 votes ahead of Jospin. All parties outside the National Front (except for ''[[Lutte ouvrière]]'') called for opposing Le Pen, even if it meant voting for Chirac. The 14-day period between the two rounds of voting was marked by demonstrations against Le Pen and slogans such as &quot;Vote for the crook, not for the fascist&quot; or &quot;Vote with a clothespin on your nose&quot;. Chirac won re-election by a landslide, with 82 percent of the vote on the second ballot. However, Chirac became increasingly unpopular during his second term. According to a July 2005 poll,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000085&amp;sid=aXp5XEjdZ3_k&amp;refer=europe |title=Europe |publisher=Bloomberg  |date=2 June 2005 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 32 percent judged Chirac favorably and 63 percent unfavorably. In 2006, ''[[The Economist]]'' wrote that Chirac &quot;is the most unpopular occupant of the Elysée Palace in the fifth republic's history.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;economistneeds&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8080753|title=What France needs|accessdate=5 August 2007|date=26 October 2006|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early term===
As the left-wing Socialist Party was in thorough disarray following Jospin's defeat, Chirac reorganised politics on the [[right-wing|right]], establishing a new party – initially called the Union of the Presidential Majority, then the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP). The RPR had broken down; A number of members had formed [[Eurosceptic]] breakaways. While the Giscardian liberals of the Union of French Democracy ([[Union for French Democracy|UDF]]) had moved to the right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080512001044/http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/archives.php?id=8465 More conservative infighting over links to French far right] [[Associated Press]] via ''Turkish Daily News''. 15 August 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The UMP won the [[French legislative election, 2002|parliamentary elections]] that followed the presidential poll with ease.

During an official visit to [[Madagascar]] on 21 July 2005, Chirac described the repression of the 1947 [[Malagasy uprising]], which left between 80,000 and 90,000 dead, as &quot;unacceptable&quot;.

Despite past opposition to state intervention the Chirac government approved a 2.8&amp;nbsp;billion euro aid package to troubled manufacturing giant [[Alstom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080509043726/http://www.iht.com/articles/2003/08/08/alstom_1.php|author=Eric Pfanner |title=France's §2.8&amp;nbsp;billion aid package unlikely to bring quick fix : Alstom bailout may be long haul |work=International Herald Tribune |date=8 August 2003 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2004, Chirac signed a [[trade agreement]] with PRC President [[Hu Jintao]] where Alstom was given one billion euro in contracts and promises of future investment in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200410/10/eng20041010_159619.html |title=People's Daily Online – France's Alstom, China ink $1.3b contracts |work=People's Daily  |date=10 October 2004 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assassination attempt===
On 14 July 2002, during [[Bastille Day]] celebrations, Chirac survived an assassination attempt by a lone gunman with a rifle hidden in a guitar case. The would-be assassin fired a shot toward the presidential [[motorcade]], before being overpowered by bystanders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/europe/newsid_2127000/2127946.stm Chirac escapes lone gunman's bullet], ''BBC'', 15 July 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The gunman, [[Maxime Brunerie]], underwent psychiatric testing; the violent far-right group with which he was associated, [[Unité Radicale]], was then administratively dissolved.

===Stroke===
In early September 2005, he suffered an event that his doctors described as a 'vascular incident'. It was reported as a 'minor stroke'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Willsher |first=Kim |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/1497612/Minor-stroke-puts-Chirac-in-hospital-but-he-hangs-on-to-reins-of-government.html |title=Minor stroke puts Chirac in hospital but he hangs on to reins of government |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London   |date=4 September 2005 |accessdate=20 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or a mini-stroke (also known as a [[transient ischemic attack]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-10722229.html |title=Belfast Telegraph |publisher=Highbeam.com |date=6 September 2005 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recovered and returned to his duties soon after.

===2005 referendum on the TCE===
{{See|Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe}}

On 29 May 2005, a [[referendum]] was held in France to decide whether the country should ratify the proposed treaty for a [[Constitution of the European Union]] (TCE). The result was a victory for the No campaign, with 55 percent of voters rejecting the treaty on a turnout of 69 percent, dealing a devastating blow to Chirac and the [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] party, as well as to part of the center-left which had supported the TCE.
&lt;!-- In an address to the nation, Chirac has declared that the new cabinet's top priority would be to curb the unemployment level, which consistently hovers above 10 percent, calling for a &quot;national mobilisation&quot; to that effect. WHICH ADRESS? No sources, and that is a rather usual statement for politicians --&gt;

===Foreign policy===
Along with [[Vladimir Putin]] (Chirac called Vladimir Putin &quot;a personal friend&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/15578042 |title=Europe's bear problem |date=25 February 2010 |work=The Economist }}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Hu Jintao]], and [[Gerhard Schröder]], Chirac emerged as a leading voice against [[George W. Bush]] in 2003 during the organization and deployment of the United States led [[Coalition of the willing|military coalition]] to [[Deposition (politics)|forcibly remove]] the then current government of [[Iraq]] controlled by the [[Ba'ath Party]] under the leadership of [[Saddam Hussein]] and resulted in the 2003–2011 [[Iraq War]]. Despite intense US pressure, Chirac threatened to veto, at that given point, a resolution in the [[UN Security Council]] that would authorise the use of military force to rid Iraq of alleged [[weapons of mass destruction]], and rallied other governments to his position. &quot;Iraq today does not represent an immediate threat that justifies an immediate war&quot;, Chirac said on 18 March 2003. Chirac was then the target of various American and British commentators supporting the decisions of Bush and [[Tony Blair]]. Future Prime Minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] acquired much of his popularity for his speech against the war at the United Nations (UN). However, following controversies concerning the CIA's [[black sites]] and [[Extraordinary rendition by the United States|extraordinary rendition]] program, the press revealed that French special services had cooperated with [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] at the same time that Villepin was countering [[US foreign policy]] at the UN headquarters in New York.

After [[Togo]]'s leader [[Gnassingbé Eyadéma]]'s death on 5 February 2005, Chirac gave him tribute and supported his son, [[Faure Gnassingbé]], who has since succeeded to his father.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot; /&gt;

On 19 January 2006, Chirac said that France was prepared to launch a [[nuclear warfare|nuclear strike]] against any country that sponsors a [[List of terrorist incidents|terrorist attack]] against French interests. He said his country's [[Force de frappe|nuclear arsenal]] had been reconfigured to include the ability to make a tactical strike in retaliation for terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/19/AR2006011903311.html Chirac: Nuclear Response to Terrorism Is Possible], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 20 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2006, the [[G8]] met to discuss international energy concerns. Despite the rising awareness of [[global warming]] issues, the G8 focuses on &quot;[[energy security]]&quot; issues. Chirac continues to be the voice within the G8 summit meetings to support international action to curb global warming and [[climate change]] concerns. Chirac warns that &quot;humanity is dancing on a [[volcano]]&quot; and calls for serious action by the world's leading industrialised nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cutco2.org/2006/07/chirac-is-not-in-favor-of-dancing-on.html Chirac is Not in Favor of Dancing on Volcanoes], on &quot;CutC02&quot;'s website, 17 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005 civil unrest and CPE protests===
{{See|2005 civil unrest in France |2006 labour protests in France}}

Following major [[2006 labour protests in France|student protests in spring 2006]], which followed [[2005 civil unrest in France|civil unrest]] in autumn 2005 after the death of two young boys in [[Clichy-sous-Bois]], one of the poorest French commune located in Paris' suburbs, Chirac retracted the proposed [[First Employment Contract]] (CPE) by &quot;promulgating [it] without applying it&quot;, an unheard-of – and, some claim, illegal – move destined to appease the protests while giving the appearance not to retract himself, and therefore to continue his support towards his Prime Minister [[Dominique de Villepin]].

===Flight tax===

Chirac requested the ''[http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/IMG/pdf/LandauENG1.pdf Landau-report]'' (published in September 2004) and combined with the ''[http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/IMG/pdf/rapportdugroupequadripartite.pdf Report of the Technical Group on Innovative Financing Mechanisms]'' formulated upon request by the Heads of State of Brazil, Chile, France and Spain (issued in December 2004), these documents present various opportunities for innovative financing mechanisms while equally stressing the advantages (stability and predictability) of tax-based models. [[UNITAID]] project was born. Today the organisation executive board is chaired by [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]].

===The Clearstream affair===
{{See|Clearstream}}

During April and May 2006, Chirac's administration was beset by a crisis as his chosen Prime Minister, Dominique de Villepin, was accused of asking [[Philippe Rondot]], a top level French [[espionage|spy]], for a secret investigation into Villepin's chief political rival, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], in 2004. This matter has been called the second [[Clearstream Affair]]. On 10 May 2006, following a Cabinet meeting, Chirac made a rare television appearance to try to protect Villepin from the scandal and to debunk allegations that Chirac himself had set up a Japanese bank account containing 300&amp;nbsp;million francs in 1992 as Mayor of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,542-2174662,00.html French farce], ''[[The Times]]'', 11 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Chirac said that &quot;The Republic is not a dictatorship of rumors, a dictatorship of calumny.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-2174839,00.html Caught in deep water: Chirac swims against a tide of scandal], ''The Times'', 11 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Announcement of intention not to seek a third term===
In a pre-recorded television broadcast aired on 11 March 2007, Jacques Chirac announced, in a widely predicted move, that he would not choose to seek a third term as France's President. &quot;My whole life has been committed to serving France, and serving peace&quot;, Chirac said, adding that he would find new ways to serve France after leaving office. He did not explain the reasons for his decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/03/12/europe/EU-POL-France-Chiracs-Future.php France's Chirac says he will not run for re-election] Associated Press, 11 March 2007. Retrieved: 11 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Chirac did not, during the broadcast, endorse any of the candidates running for election, but did devote several minutes of his talk to a plea against extremist politics that was considered a thinly disguised invocation to voters not to vote for [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] and a recommendation to [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] not to orient his campaign so as to include themes traditionally associated with Le Pen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/11/AR2007031101091.html Chirac Leaving Stage Admired and Scorned] by John Leicester, Associated Press, 11 March 2007. Retrieved: 11 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy over hijab==

French President Jacques Chirac declared his complete rejection of the wearing of the Islamic headscarf, or [[hijab]], by female Muslims in French schools and public corporations. He adds that he perceives a kind of hostility in the wearing of the hijab. Chirac stated that with banning the hijab, there will be more integration in French society. He has contributed in establishing a law that prohibits wearing the hijab and other religious symbols and manifestations in schools and public corporations. This has created a great controversy in France as some Muslims believe they are being discriminated against.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arabwestreport.info/?q=node/12158 (Arab West Report: Art. 28, Week 50/2003, 10 – 15 December)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life after presidency==
Shortly after leaving office, he launched the [[Fondation Chirac]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jyHbiQwT8A2VnasPh30A3G8kbt3w |title=Chirac launches foundation 'to awaken consciences' |agency=AFP   |date=8 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in June 2008. Since then it has been striving for peace through advocacy on five main programmes: 
conflict prevention, access to water and sanitation, access to quality medicines and healthcare, access to land resources, and preservation of cultural diversity. It supports field projects that involve local people and provide concrete and innovative solutions. Chirac chairs the jury for the [[Fondation Chirac Prize for Conflict Prevention|Prize for Conflict Prevention]] awarded every year by his foundation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondationchirac.eu/en/the-fondation-chirac-prize-for-conflict-prevention/ The Fondation Chirac Prize for Conflict Prevention]&lt;/ref&gt;.

He also became a lifetime member of the [[Constitutional Council of France]]. He sat for the first time in the Council on 15 November 2007, six months after leaving the French Presidency. Immediately after Sarkozy's victory, Chirac moved into a 180 square meters duplex on the Quai Voltaire in Paris lent to him by the family of former [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] Prime Minister [[Rafik Hariri]]. During the [[Didier Schuller]] affair, the latter accused Hariri of having participated to the illegal funding of the [[Rally for the Republic|RPR]]'s political campaigns, but the justice closed the case without further investigations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/actualite/politiques/250314.FR.php Chirac trouve un point de chute à Paris chez la famille Hariri], ''[[Libération]]'', 27 April 2007 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 April 2008, Chirac's office announced that he had undergone successful surgery to fit a [[pacemaker]]. In January 2009, it was reported that Chirac had been hospitalised after being attacked by his pet [[Maltese (dog)|Maltese]] poodle. According to Chirac's wife Bernadette, the dog, named Sumo, had a history of unpredictable and vicious behavior, and had previously been medicated with antidepressants in an attempt to control it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=President Chirac hospitalised after mauling by his clinically depressed poodle |publisher=[[Daily Mail]]'' (London) |date=21 January 2009 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1126136/Former-French-President-Chirac-hospitalised-mauling-clinically-depressed-poodle.html?ITO=1490 |first=Ian |last=Sparks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 March 2011, he went on trial for charges of corruption (the first former French head of state to stand trial since [[Philippe Pétain]], who surrendered and collaborated with Nazi Germany) involving the misuse of public money during his time as [[mayor of Paris]] (1977–1995).&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc trial opens&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12661446 | title=France: Jacques Chirac corruption trial opens | accessdate=8 March 2011 | date=7 March 2011 |publisher=BBC News   | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5x1Fr7GjO | archivedate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was accused of paying cronies and political allies for 28 jobs that did not exist.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc trial opens&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tele&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/8366721/Jacques-Chirac-trial-faces-further-delays.html | title=Jacques Chirac trial faces further delays | accessdate=8 March 2011 | date=7 March 2011 | publisher=The Telegraph | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5x1FyQ5W1 | archivedate=8 March 2011 | first=Henry | last=Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Chirac, nine others stood trial in two separate cases, one dealing with fictional jobs for 21 people and the other with jobs for the remaining seven.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc trial opens&quot; /&gt; France's current Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[Alain Juppé]], was sentenced to a 14-month suspended prison sentence for the same case in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC guilty 15 December&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=French ex-President Jacques Chirac guilty of corruption|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16194089|publisher=BBC  |accessdate=15 December 2011|date=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memoirs and popularity===
In Volume 2 of his memoirs published in June 2011, Chirac mocked his successor [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] as &quot;irritable, rash, impetuous, disloyal, ungrateful, and un-French&quot;.&lt;ref name=FE&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13710626 &quot;France election 2012: Chirac mocks Sarkozy in memoirs&quot;], BBC. 9 June 2011.

==In culture==
===Impact on French popular culture===
Because of Jacques Chirac's long career in visible government positions, he has often been parodied or caricatured: Young Jacques Chirac is the basis of a young, dashing bureaucrat character in the 1976 [[Asterix]] comic strip album ''[[Obelix and Co.]]'', proposing methods to quell Gallic unrest to elderly, old-style Roman politicians. Chirac was also featured in ''[[Le Bêbête Show]]'' as an overexcited, jumpy character.

Jacques Chirac is a favorite character of ''[[Les Guignols de l'Info]]'', a satiric latex [[puppet show]]. He was once portrayed as a rather likable, though overexcited, character; however, following the corruption allegations, he has been shown as a kind of dilettante and incompetent who pilfers public money and lies through his teeth. His character for a while developed a [[superhero]] alter ego, ''Super Menteur'' (&quot;Super Liar&quot;) in order to get him out of embarrassing situations. Because of his alleged improprieties, he was lambasted in a song ''Chirac en prison'' (&quot;Chirac in jail&quot;) by French punk band [[Les Wampas]], with a video clip made by the ''Guignols''.

===Portrayals in film===
His role is played by [[Charles Fathy]] in the [[Oliver Stone]] film ''[[W. (film)|W.]]''

'''Jean Sarkozy de Nagy-Bocsa''' (born 1 September 1986) is the son of the [[President of France]], [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] from his first marriage, to [[Nicolas Sarkozy#Marie-Dominique Culioli|Marie-Dominique Culioli]]. Jean is a regional councillor in the city of Neuilly-sur-Seine, France and registered as a 1st year Law student at [[Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne University]] in 2007. He is a backroom activist for his father's [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP), a center-right party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080306.wwfrance06/BNStory/International Globe and Mail], &quot;Setting his own course where his dad once trod, Jean Sarkozy, 21, has the instincts of a seasoned politician&quot;, Anita Elash, 6 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neuilly-sur-Seine mayorship==
Nicolas Sarkozy attempted to parachute David Martinon, his protégé  and presidential spokesman, into the mayorship of Neuilly-sur-Seine, the richest town in France, where the president had formerly served as mayor. It was seen as one of the UMP's safest seats because 86% of the voters supported Sarkozy in the 2007 presidential election.  Jean Sarkozy was asked to persuade the voters to support his father's choice. After a poll showed that Martinon was so unpopular that he would lose the election, Jean publicly broke rank and said it was impossible to continue backing his father's mayoral choice. He and other politicians from the president's centre-right UMP party decided to campaign on their own ticket.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/feb/12/france The Guardian 12 February 2008], &quot;Turmoil as 'Sarkoville' turns against French president in mayoral race: Sarkozy's choice offers to quit as he is so unpopular&quot;, Angelique Chrisafis, 12 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Martinon stepped down as the party's candidate for mayor. Jean Sarkozy announced he was running for office himself as the UMP candidate for regional councillor in the electoral district of Neuilly-Sud. He was born, brought up and now lives in Neuilly-Sud, which includes the Bagatelle quarter, a neighbourhood of 27,000 people, the richest part of Neuilly. He faced three other candidates, Marie Brannens from the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]], and candidates from the [[Democratic Movement (France)|Democratic Movement]] (MoDem) and the [[National Front (France)|Front National]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=lefigaro.fr |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2008/03/03/01002-20080303ARTFIG00428-jean-sarkozy-fils-de-president-en-campagne.php |title='&amp;#39;Le Figaro'&amp;#39;, &quot;Jean Sarkozy, Fils de President en Campagne&quot;, 3 March 2008 |publisher=Lefigaro.fr |date= |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==La Défense controversy==

In 2009 Jean was offered to become head of Epad, the development agency for [[La Défense]], just west of Paris. La Défense is an important office centre, with 43 high-rise buildings, and its development agency controls an annual budget of more than 1 billion euros. French and many international newspapers reported this as a new case of [[nepotism]]. Much criticism has been made about the obvious lack of academic qualities and professional experience for such a high position. An online petition against the nomination has been diffused in all of the major news outlets and receives some 10,000 signatures a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Auteur : Des habitants de La D&amp;eacute;fense inquiets |url=http://www.mesopinions.com/Jean-Sarkozy--renoncez-a-postuler-au-poste-de-president-de-l-EPAD-petition-petitions-fdc75d89c604d782a5b2198681c67f26.html |title=Pétition sur &quot;Jean Sarkozy, renoncez à postuler au poste de président de l'EPAD&quot; : Site de pétitions en ligne |publisher=Mesopinions.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009, a survey found that 64% of French people oppose the arrival of Sarkozy at the Epad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fr.reuters.com/article/topNews/idFRPAE59F05620091016 |title=64% des Français contre l'arrivée de Jean Sarkozy à l'Epad &amp;#124; À la Une &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Fr.reuters.com |date=2009-02-09 |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy prompted various ironic comments from the international press. The Daily Mail noted that &quot;when asked whether the President's son might be a bit young for such a relatively prestigious job, [EPAD's current president] responded using the traditional French political foil of quoting classic literature: 'In souls nobly born, valour does not depend upon age.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mail Foreign Service |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1219289/Sarkozy-criticised-keeping-family-giving-son-Jean-government-job.html |title=Sarkozy criticised for keeping it in the family after giving his son Jean a top government job &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2009-10-09 |accessdate=2011-04-17 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Times calls the nomination an &quot;astonishing act of nepotism by Nicolas Sarkozy&quot; and reminds that &quot;[Jean], who is repeating his second year of undergraduate law at the Sorbonne, after having repeated the first year, was elected to a Neuilly seat on the notoriously sleaze-ridden department council last year. He was immediately given the job of heading Dad's Union for a Popular Movement on the body.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://timescorrespondents.typepad.com/charles_bremner/2009/10/sarkozy-rules-okay.html ]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The President of [[Medef]] replied to these criticisms saying she believed it was &quot;fantastic that a young and motivated man&quot; may want to be at the head of the largest business district in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fr.reuters.com/article/topNews/idFRPAE59C06F20091013?pageNumber=3&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 |title=Jean Sarkozy reçoit l'appui de son père et de la droite &amp;#124; À la Une &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Fr.reuters.com |date=2009-02-09 |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Nicolas Sarkozy defended his son by saying that &quot;it's never good when someone is attacked in an excessive manner for no reason,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fr.reuters.com/article/topNews/idFRPAE59C06F20091013?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 |title=Jean Sarkozy reçoit l'appui de son père et de la droite &amp;#124; À la Une &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Fr.reuters.com |date=2009-02-09 |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; not long however after having been mocked by some French media for having fiercely underlined during an unrelated speech on high school reform that &quot;what matters in France to succeed no longer relates to birth privileges, rather, to succeed, it is important to work hard and to have demonstrated significant skills at school, at work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=liberation |url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xaspb1_sarkozy-pour-reussir-il-ne-faut-plu_news |title=Sarkozy: &quot;Pour réussir, il ne faut plus être bien né&quot; - une vidéo Nieuws &amp; Politiek |publisher=Dailymotion |date=2009-10-10 |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Sarkozy said he is not going to give up the position,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2009/10/14/pourquoi-jean-sarkozy-s-accroche-malgre-l-ampleur-de-la-polemique_1253690_823448.html |title=Pourquoi Jean Sarkozy s’accroche, malgré l’ampleur de la polémique |publisher=LeMonde.fr |date= |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and demanded on French television not to be judged on his name, but on his acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qc4gkj9PZc&amp;feature=fvw |title=Jean Sarkozy : first time in TV |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received the support of [[David Douillet]], a former champion of the world of [[Judo]], newly elected as a [[Chamber of Deputies of France|député]] under the banner of the UMP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualites/politique/20091020.OBS5183/david_douillet_defend_jean_sarkozy_et_le_maintien_du_bo.html |title=David Douillet défend Jean Sarkozy et le maintien du bouclier fiscal - Politique - Nouvelobs.com |publisher=Tempsreel.nouvelobs.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, finally due to mounting pressure, Jean Sarkozy had to renounce.

==Personal life==
Jean Sarkozy was born in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] and educated at the [[Lycée Pasteur]]. He married [[Jessica Sebaoun-Darty]] on 10 September 2008 at the Neuilly-sur-Seine city hall. She gave birth to their first child—a son, Solal Nicolas Marc-Andre—on 13 January 2010. His wife is the daughter of Marc-André Sebaoun and Isabelle Maruani (née Darty). Maruani is heiress to a major [[consumer electronics]] company, the [[Darty]] group.  He has denied reports that he intends to convert from Catholicism to Judaism, Sebaoun's religion.  The cartoonist [[Siné]] came under sharp criticism and was sacked from his magazine after accusing Jean Sarkozy of converting out of ambition and being sued by the [[International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism]] (LICRA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/05/world/europe/05france.html New York Times],&quot;A Scooter, a Sarkozy and Rancor Collide&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, ''[[Le Canard enchaîné]]'', a satirical weekly newspaper, reported that French police had gone to extraordinary lengths to try to find his scooter when it was stolen, including taking DNA samples from his helmet. The scooter was recovered in ten days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Anita Elash |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080306.wwfrance06/BNStory/International |title=Globe and Mail.

'''Jean-Pierre Raffarin''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃ pjɛʁ ʁafaʁɛ̃|-|Fr-Jean-Pierre_Raffarin.ogg}}; born 3 August 1948 in [[Poitiers]], Vienne) is a French conservative politician and [[French Senate|senator]] for [[Vienne]].

Jean-Pierre Raffarin served as the [[Prime Minister of France]] from 6 May 2002 to 31 May 2005, resigning after France's rejection of the [[French referendum on the European Constitution|referendum]] on the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Union draft constitution]]. However, after Raffarin resigned, he said that his decision was not based on the outcome of the vote. Opinion polls following his resignation suggested that Raffarin was one of France's least popular prime ministers since the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] was established in 1958. However, according to the book &quot;France: 1815–2003&quot;, written by Martin Evans and Emmanuel Godwin, Raffarin was &quot;a remarkably popular prime minister&quot; despite his ability &quot;to state the obvious and to make empty statements&quot;.

Raffarin is married to Anne-Marie Perrier (b. 1952 in Chamalières) and has a daughter, Fleur.

==Early life==
Born 3 August 1948, Raffarin grew up in [[Poitiers]] as the son of a prominent national figure: his father [[Jean Raffarin]] was a vice-minister of Agriculture in the government of [[Pierre Mendes-France]] (1954–1955).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Man in the News; A Leader to Lean On; Jean-Pierre Raffarin |first=John |last=Tagliabue |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/07/world/man-in-the-news-a-leader-to-lean-on-jean-pierre-raffarin.html |newspaper=New York Times |date=7 May 2002 |accessdate=8 November 2010 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied law at the [[University of Paris II: Panthéon-Assas|University of Paris II Panthéon-Assas]] and later graduated from [[ESCP Europe]] business school. He started his professional career in marketing.

In the 1970s, his first political commitment was in the association of [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]]'s young supporters. Defining himself as a &quot;''giscardien''&quot;, he joined the staff of [[Lionel Stoléru]], Secretary of state for Manual Workers and Immigration, and the [[Republican Party (France)|Republican Party]], the liberal-conservative component of the centre-right confederation the [[Union for French Democracy]] (UDF).

==Political career==

In the 1980s, he started a career in local politics in [[Poitou-Charentes]] region. With the support of [[René Monory]], the local political leader, he took the chair of the regional council in 1988.
Seven years later, he was elected senator of [[Vienne]] ''département''.

'''Political functions'''

===In government===
During the [[French presidential election, 1995|1995 presidential campaign]], while most UDF politicians supported [[Édouard Balladur]], he chose the winning candidacy of [[Jacques Chirac]]. In return, he was nominated Minister of Small and Medium-sized Companies, Commerce and Craft Industry in [[Alain Juppé]]'s cabinet (1995–1997).

At the same time, the pro-Chirac UDF members founded the [[Popular Party for French Democracy]]. Then, he returned in the Republican Party, became [[Liberal Democracy (France)|Liberal Democracy]] (DL) in 1997. He was vice-president of DL until 2002.

===Prime minister===
During the [[French presidential election, 2002|2002 presidential campaign]], he advocated the union of the right behind the incumbent President Chirac. After his re-election, Chirac wished to give a sign of political renewal. Furthermore, elected in a special second round by a majority of left-wing voters, he searched for a moderate to lead the cabinet and the [[French legislative election, 2002|June 2002 legislative campaign]]. Raffarin participated in the formation of the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP).

His political policies combined [[authority]] and moderate economical liberalism – that is, the support of [[laissez-faire]] economic policies. In 2003 he launched reforms of the public retirement scheme and of [[decentralisation]], which led to many strikes. During the summer of 2003 the country experienced an unusual [[European Heat Wave of 2003|heat wave]] which caused the death of nearly 15,000 people. The perceived late reaction of the government was blamed on his administration. In 2004 he began a reform of the French state-run health-care system.

Raffarin's governments were known for their internal quarrels with various ministers taking opposite positions in public. The alleged lack of authority of the Prime Minister was mocked by the media.

On 28 March 2004 the ruling [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] party suffered an important defeat during the [[French regional elections, 2004|regional elections]], with all but one ''[[List of regions in France|région]]'' out of 22 of mainland France going to the opposition ([[French Socialist Party|PS]], [[French Communist Party|PCF]], [[Les Verts]]). This was generally interpreted, including by Raffarin himself in his post-election speech, as &quot;a sign of distrust against the government from the electorate&quot;. On 30 March 2004 Jean-Pierre Raffarin tendered the resignation of his government to president Jacques Chirac, who immediately re-appointed him prime minister, with the delegation to form a new government. This major cabinet reshuffle removed some of its most controversial ministers like [[Luc Ferry]] (education) or [[Jean-François Mattei]] (health).

===Resignation===
Raffarin's resignation was accepted by President Chirac on 30 May 2005, after the &quot;no&quot; victory at the [[European Constitution]] referendum, and he was replaced as Prime Minister by [[Dominique de Villepin]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4595423.stm |title=De Villepin appointed French PM  |date=31 May 2005 |publisher=BBC News   |accessdate=8 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 September 2005, he was elected Senator in the Vienne ''département''. Speculation were that he could eventually try to become [[List of Presidents of the French Senate|President of the Senate]] or President of the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] if Nicolas Sarkozy won the [[French presidential election, 2007|2007 presidential election]]. He became one of the Vice Presidents of the UMP in 2007. In September 2008, he sought the Senate UMP fraction’s investiture to become President of the Senate, but was defeated by [[Gérard Larcher]].

Raffarin is Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur ([[Legion of Honour]]) and Grand-Croix de l'ordre national du Mérite (National Order of Merit).

===International policies===
In September 2004 the US conservative [[blogosphere]] erupted with criticism of France when a [[New York Post]] opinion piece claimed that ''[[Le Figaro]]'' reported that Raffarin said &quot;the Iraqi insurgents are our best allies&quot;. There is no trace of this quote in ''Le Figaro'', and the opinion piece is no longer available from the NYP website.
During a state visit to China on 21 April 2005 he avoided opposing the new [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China|&quot;anti-secession&quot; law on Taiwan]], stating that &quot;The anti-secession law is completely compatible with the position of France&quot; and &quot;The position of France has always been to 'one China' and we will remain attached to this position&quot;. On the embargo on weapons, he stated that &quot;France continues to ask for a lifting of the embargo, and does not see what could lead the European Council to change position on that question&quot;. [http://sg.news.yahoo.com/050423/1/3s3pn.html] [http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=9677&amp;t=1&amp;c=1]

==Raffarinades==
Jean-Pierre Raffarin was often teased for his optimistic [[aphorism]]s, known colloquially and ironically as ''raffarinades'', the best known being ''La route est droite, mais la pente est forte'' (&quot;The road is straight, but the slope is steep&quot;). Some consider that the word ''raffarinade'' was created in reference to the other French word ''mazarinade''. However, ''mazarinade'' refers to the songs that the ''frondeurs'' (French revolutionaries during the ''Régence'' of Queen Anne – Archduchess of Austria – and chief minister [[Cardinal de Mazarin]], before king Louis XIV's personal reign) sang to mock the unpopular chief minister.

Raffarin also tried his English prior to the referendum on the European draft Constitution but this turned out to be an ill-advised idea, as shown in this famous excerpt [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4118142947508150872&amp;q=raffarin&amp;pl=true] from his speech: &quot;Win the yes need the no to win against the no.&quot; The referendum itself was enventually nicknamed ''le Raffarindum'' by its opponents while ''[[Journée de solidarité envers les personnes âgées]]'' (''Day of solidarity with the elderly'') is sometimes referred to as ''la Saint-Raffarin'' by discontented workers (following a decision by Raffarin, French workers are supposed to work on [[Whit Monday]] for free).

The '''Minister for the Economy, Industry and Employment''' (''Ministre de l'économie, de l'industrie et de l'emploi''), or '''Minister of Finance''' for short, is one of the most prominent positions in the [[French government ministers|cabinet]] of France after the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]].

It now has a colleague of equal rank: the '''Minister for the Budget, Public Accounts, the Civil Service and State Reform''' (''Ministre du budget, des comptes publics, de la fonction publique et de la réforme de l'État''). This ministry is responsible for the government real estate strategy through [[Service France Domaine]].

The exact title of the minister has varied throughout time; it may not always include &quot;economy&quot;, &quot;industry&quot;, or &quot;finances&quot;.

The Minister oversees:
* the drafting of taxation laws by exercising direct authority over the Tax Policy Board (''Direction de la législation fiscale'') of the Department of Revenue (''[[:fr:Direction générale des impôts]]'');
* national funds and financial and economic system, especially with the Office of the Treasurer and Receiver General (''Direction générale du Trésor et de la politique économique''), not to be confused with the Public Treasury (''Trésor Public''), that is the Office of the Comptroller-General (''Direction générale de la comptabilité publique'') under the authority of the Minister of Budget);
* the development, regulation and control of economy including industry, tourism, small business, competition, and consumer security, and other matters excluding energy, industrial security, environmental affairs and transportations which are under the authority of the Ministre d’Etat, [[Minister for Ecology and Sustainable Planning and Development]];
* employment policies and career education.

By her authority above the financial assets of the State, the financial and economic national system and the taxation rules, the Minister is allowed to represent France in the European Union council of the minister of the Economy and Finance (ECOFIN).

See: http://www.minefi.gouv.fr/directions_services/sircom/ministere/organigramme_minefe.htm

The current Minister for the Economy, Industry and Employment is [[Francois Baroin]].

== The Minister for the Budget, Public Accounts, the Civil Service and State Reform ==

The Minister for the Budget, Public Accounts, the Civil Service and State Reform supervises:
* the preparation of the finance law ([[budget]]) (with the help of his colleague '''Minister for the Economy, Industry and Employment''' in taxation ruling matters, he requires the Board for Tax Policy of the ''[[Direction générale des impôts]]''), which is then submitted to [[Parliament of France|Parliament]] for [[law|amendment]] and final approval;
* the [[taxation]] system :
* the accounting of the State and all public bodies (by the ''[[Trésor public|''Direction générale de la comptablilité publique]]'').

See: http://www.budget.gouv.fr/

The [[Taxation in France|French taxation]] system is supervised by three separate board:
* the ''[[Direction générale des impôts]]'' for tax evaluation and collecting some taxes such as [[VAT]] or [[corporate tax]];
* the ''[[Direction générale de la comptablilité publique]]'' (or ''[[Direction générale de la comptablilité publique|Trésor Public]]'') for collecting some other taxes calculated by the ''[[Direction générale des impôts]]'' including [[income tax]] or local taxes based on Estate locative value.
* the ''[[Direction générale des douanes et des droits indirects]]'' for [[customs]], for tax on petrol and fuels and for [[indirect tax|special indirect taxes]] such as taxes on alcohol, tobacco, etc.);
The taxation [[information system]] are being modernised by the so-called [[Copernic tax project]].


By delegation of the Prime Minister, he supervises also the Public Services (essentially statutes and salaries of the State, local and hospital Public Services) and the modernisation of the State (including computing means).

He is responsible with their colleagues for Health, Youth and Sport and for Labour, Labour Relations and Solidarity of the equilibrium of social accounts.

See: http://www.minefi.gouv.fr/directions_services/sircom/ministere/organigramme_mbcpfp.htm

The current Minister for the Budget, Public Accounts, the Civil Service and the Reform of the State is [[François Baroin]].

==Location==
The Ministry of Finances is situated in [[Bercy]], a district in [[Paris]] (in the [[XIIe arrondissement|12th arrondissement]]). The building extends to the [[Seine River]], where there is an embarcadero with fast river boats for faster liaisons to other government agencies.

That is why the French media often refer to it as simply &quot;Bercy&quot;. The sentence ''the Bercy Fortress'' (''la forteresse de Bercy'') refers to the Ministry as a dark department with obtuse [[civil servants]], especially of high rank. That is emphasized by the impressive look of the building.

For evident practical reasons, the two ministers share the building and some common services that were under the former ministry of Economy, Finances and Industry.

* The general interior security of the country, with respect to criminal acts or natural catastrophes
** including the major law-enforcement forces (see [[Police in France]])

* relations between the central government and local governments;
* [[logistics]] and organization of political [[election]]s, at the national and prefectoral levels (but the results of the elections are overseen by the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] or the administrative courts);
* regulation of immigration and preventing illegal immigration;
* integration of legal immigrants (professionally, linguistically, housing, etc.);
* all [[département]]al ''[[préfet]]s'' and sub-prefects are subordinate to the Minister of the Interior.

[[Image:Place Beauvau entrance dsc00801.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The entrance to the Ministry in Place Beauvau is guarded by one gendarme (to the left) and one policewoman (to the right). Joint gendarmerie/police guard duty was seen as a way to bridge the differences between the services.]]

While the ministry of the Interior supervises police forces, it does not supervise criminal enquiries; criminal enquiries are conducted under the supervision of the [[judiciary]].

The Ministry's headquarters are located on the '''place Beauvau''', facing the [[Élysée Palace]]. &quot;Place Beauvau&quot; is often used as a metonym for the ministry.

The current Minister of the Interior is [[Claude Guéant]].

'''Neuilly-sur-Seine''' ({{IPA-fr|nøji syʁ sɛn}}) is a [[Communes of France|''commune'']] in the western suburbs of [[Paris]], [[France]]. It is located {{convert|6.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the [[Kilometre Zero|center of Paris]].

Although Neuilly is technically a [[banlieue|suburb]] of [[Paris]], it is immediately adjacent to the city and directly extends it.  The area is composed of mostly wealthy, select residential neighbourhoods, as well as the [[headquarter]]s of many [[corporation]]s. It is often lumped together with some areas of the neighbouring [[XVIe arrondissement|16th arrondissement]] of [[Paris]] as [[Auteuil-Neuilly-Passy]], a compendium of &quot;[[bourgeois]]&quot; (i.e., upscale) neighbourhoods in Paris.

==History==
The origins of Neuilly-sur-Seine's name are quite confused and controversial. Originally, Neuilly was a small hamlet under the jurisdiction of Villiers, a larger settlement mentioned in medieval sources as early as 832 and now absorbed by the commune of [[Levallois-Perret]]. It was not until 1222 that the little settlement of Neuilly, established on the banks of the [[Seine]], was mentioned for the first time in a [[charter]] of the [[Saint-Denis Basilica|Abbey of Saint-Denis]]: the name was recorded in [[Medieval Latin]] as ''Portus de Lulliaco'', meaning &quot;Port of Lulliacum&quot;. In 1224 another charter of Saint-Denis recorded the name as ''Lugniacum''. In a sales contract dated 1266 the name was also recorded as ''Luingni''.

In 1316, however, in a ruling of the ''[[parlement]]'' of [[Paris]], the name was recorded as ''Nully'', quite a different name from those recorded before. In a document dated 1376 the name was again recorded as ''Nulliacum'' (the Medieval Latin version of ''Nully''). Then in the following centuries the name recorded alternated between ''Luny'' and ''Nully'', and it is only after 1648 that the name was definitely set as ''Nully''. The name spelt ''Neuilly'' after the [[Académie française|French Academy]] standard of pronunciation of the ''ill'' as a ''y'' (See IPA at the top).

Various explanations and etymologies have been proposed to explain these discrepancies in the names of Neuilly recorded over the centuries. It seems most plausible to consider that the original name of Neuilly was ''Lulliacum'' or ''Lugniacum'', and that it was only later corrupted into ''Nulliacum'' / ''Nully''. Some interpret ''Lulliacum'' or ''Lugniacum'' as meaning &quot;estate of Lullius (or Lunius)&quot;, probably a [[Gallo-Roman]] landowner. This interpretation is based on the many placenames of France made up of the names of Gallo-Roman landowners and suffixed with the traditional placename suffix &quot;-acum&quot;. However, other researchers object that it is unlikely that Neuilly owes its name to a Gallo-Roman [[patronym]], because during the Roman occupation of [[Gaul]] the area of Neuilly was inside the large [[Forest of Rouvray]], of which the [[Bois de Boulogne]] is all that remains today, and was probably not settled yet.

These researchers contend that it is only after the fall of the Roman Empire and the Germanic invasions that the area of Neuilly was deforested and settled. Thus, they think that the name ''Lulliacum'' or ''Lugniacum'' comes from the ancient Germanic word ''lund'' meaning &quot;forest&quot;, akin to [[Old Norse]] ''lundr'' meaning &quot;grove&quot;, to which the placename suffix &quot;-acum&quot; was added. The Old Norse word ''lundr'' has indeed left many placenames across Europe, such as the city of [[Lund]] in Sweden, the Forest of the Londe in [[Normandy]], or the many English placenames containing &quot;lound&quot;, &quot;lownde&quot;, or &quot;lund&quot; in their name, or ending in &quot;-land&quot;. However, this interesting theory fails to explain why the &quot;d&quot; of ''lund'' is missing in ''Lulliacum'' or ''Lugniacum''.

Concerning the discrepancy in names over the centuries, the most probable explanation is that the original name ''Lulliacum'' or ''Lugniacum'' was later corrupted into ''Nulliacum'' / ''Nully'' by inversion of the consonants, perhaps under the influence of an old Celtic word meaning &quot;swampy land, boggy land&quot; (as was the land around Neuilly-sur-Seine in ancient times) which is found in the name of many French places  anciently covered with water, such as Noue, Noë, Nouan, Nohant, etc. Or perhaps the consonants were simply inverted under the influence of the many settlements of France called Neuilly (a frequent placename whose etymology is completely different from the special case of Neuilly-sur-Seine).

Until the [[French Revolution]], the settlement was often referred to as ''Port-Neuilly'', but at the creation of [[commune in France|French communes]] in 1790 the &quot;Port&quot; was dropped and the newly born commune was named simply ''Neuilly''.

On 1 January 1860, the city of Paris was enlarged by annexing neighboring communes. On that occasion, a part of the territory of Neuilly-sur-Seine was annexed by the city of Paris, and forms now the neighborhood of [[Ternes]], in the [[XVIIe arrondissement|17th arrondissement]] of Paris.

On 11 January 1867, part of the territory of Neuilly-sur-Seine was detached and merged with a part of the territory of [[Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine|Clichy]] to create the commune of [[Levallois-Perret]].

On 2 May 1897, the commune name officially became Neuilly-sur-Seine (meaning &quot;Neuilly upon [[Seine]]&quot;), in order to distinguish it from the many communes of France also called Neuilly. However, most people continue to refer to Neuilly-sur-Seine as simply &quot;Neuilly&quot;. During the [[1900 Summer Olympics]], it hosted the [[Basque pelota at the 1900 Summer Olympics|basque pelota]] events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1900/PEL/mens-two-man-teams-with-cesta.html Sports-reference.com Summer Olympics Paris 14 June 1900 men's basque pelota two-teams results.] Accessed 14 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Hospital of Paris]] was founded in 1906.

In 1919, the [[Treaty of Neuilly]] was signed with [[Bulgaria]] in Neuilly-sur-Seine to conclude its role in [[World War I]].

In 1929, the [[Bois de Boulogne]], which was hitherto divided between the communes of Neuilly-sur-Seine and [[Boulogne-Billancourt]], was annexed in its entirety by the city of Paris.

==Personal life==
===Family background===
{{Main|Family history of Nicolas Sarkozy}}
Sarkozy is the son of Pál István Ernő Sárközy de Nagy-Bócsa&lt;ref&gt;It is the &quot;westernised&quot;, or &quot;internationalised&quot;, version of his Hungarian name, in which the given name is put first (whereas in Hungarian given names come last), and the French aristocratic particle &quot;de&quot; is used instead of the Hungarian aristocratic ending &quot;-i&quot;. This &quot;westernisation&quot; of Hungarian names is frequent, particularly for people with an aristocratic name.  Check for example the leader of Hungary from 1920 to 1944, whose Hungarian name is nagybányai Horthy Miklós, but who is known in English as [[Miklós Horthy|Miklós Horthy de Nagybánya]]. The French name of Pál Sárközy de Nagy-Bócsa from 1948 is Paul Étienne Arnaud Sarközy de Nagy-Bocsa, where the given name Pál has been translated into Paul in French, and the acute accents on the &quot;a&quot; of Sarközy and the &quot;o&quot; of Bocsa were dropped as these letters never carry an acute accent (''accent aigu'') in French.  The [[diaeresis (diacritic)|trema]] on the &quot;o&quot; of Sárközy was kept, probably because French typewriters allow this combination, whereas it is impossible to write &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot; with an acute accent using a French typewriter.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-hu|&lt;!--Leave the lower case 'n' please, it's not an error!--&gt;nagybócsai Sárközy Pál}} {{IPA-hu|nɒɟ͡ʝboːt͡ʃɒi ʃaːrkøzi paːl||Pal_sarkozy.ogg}}; in some sources ''Nagy-Bócsay Sárközy Pál István Ernő''),&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/15/opinion/15tue4.html?_r=2&amp;th&amp;emc=th&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin | title = The New French President's Roots Are Worth Remembering | date =15 May 2007 | accessdate=28 September 2008 | work=The New York Times | first=Serge | last=Schmemann}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[aristocracy|aristocrat]], and Andrée Jeanne &quot;Dadu&quot; Mallah (b.

===Early life===
During Sarkozy's childhood, his father allegedly refused to give his wife's family any financial help, even though he had founded his own advertising agency and had become wealthy.  The family lived in a mansion owned by Sarkozy's grandfather, Benedict Mallah, in the [[17th Arrondissement]] of Paris. The family later moved to [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], one of the wealthiest [[Commune in France|communes]] of the [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]] ''[[Régions in France|région]]'' immediately west of the 17th Arrondissement just outside of Paris.  According to Sarkozy, his staunchly [[Gaullist]] grandfather was more of an influence on him than his father, whom he rarely saw.  Sarkozy was, accordingly, raised Catholic.&lt;ref name=BBCProf/&gt;

Sarkozy said that being abandoned by his father shaped much of who he is today. He also has said that, in his early years, he felt inferior in relation to his wealthier and taller classmates.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''see Catherine Nay's semi-official biography''&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;What made me who I am now is the sum of all the humiliations suffered during childhood&quot;, he said later.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Education===
Sarkozy was enrolled in the ''Lycée Chaptal'', a well regarded public middle and high school in Paris's [[8th arrondissement of Paris|8th arrondissement]], where he failed his ''[[Education in France#Secondary education|sixième]]''. His family then sent him to the ''Cours Saint-Louis de Monceau'', a private Catholic school in the 17th arrondissement, where he was reportedly a mediocre student,&lt;ref&gt;''Un pouvoir nommé désir'', Catherine Nay, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; but where he nonetheless obtained his ''[[baccalauréat]]'' in 1973. He enrolled at the ''[[University of Paris X: Nanterre|Université Paris X Nanterre]]'', where he graduated with an MA in [[Private law]], and later with a [[DEA (former French degree)|DEA]] degree in Business law. Paris X Nanterre had been the starting place for the [[May '68]] student movement and was still a stronghold of [[leftist]] students. Described as a quiet student, Sarkozy soon joined the right-wing student organization, in which he was very active. He completed his military service as a part time Air Force cleaner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsnours.com/2008/07/le-service-mili.html |title=Le service militaire de Sakozy|publisher=Nousnours |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating, he entered the ''[[Paris Institute of Political Studies|Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris]]'', better known as Sciences Po, (1979–1981) but failed to graduate&lt;ref&gt;Augustin Scalbert, [http://www.rue89.com/2007/09/18/un-soupcon-de-vantardise-sur-les-cv-ministeriels Un soupçon de vantardise sur les CV ministériels], ''[[Rue 89]]'', 18 September 2007 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to an insufficient command of the English language.&lt;ref name=&quot;cath_nay&quot;&gt;See Catherine Nay's semi-official biography&lt;/ref&gt; After passing the [[bar (law)|bar]], he became a lawyer specializing in [[business law|business]] and [[family law]],&lt;ref name=&quot;cath_nay&quot;/&gt; and was one of [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s top French advocates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualites/international/europe/20090629.OBS2316/berlusconi__le_bon_nicolas_sarkozy_a_ete_mon_avocat.html |title=Berlusconi : le &quot;bon Nicolas Sarkozy&quot; a été mon avocat |work=Le Nouvel Observateur |location=France |date=29 June 2009|accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2009/06/sezioni/politica/berlusconi-varie-2/berlusconi-russia/berlusconi-russia.html |title=Corfù, il vertice del disgelo &quot;Riparte collaborazione Nato-Russia&quot; Il Cavaliere: &quot;Mandai il mio avvocato Sarkozy da lui per la Georgia...&quot; |publisher=Repubblica |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unionesarda.ilsole24ore.com/Articoli/Articolo/131694 |title=Berlusconi al vertice Nato-Russia &quot;Quando mandai l'avvocato Sarkozy&quot; |publisher=L'UNIONE SARDA.it|date=20 November 1948 |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriages===
====Marie-Dominique Culioli====
Sarkozy married his first wife, Marie-Dominique Culioli, on 23 September 1982; her father was a [[pharmacist]] from [[Vico, Corse-du-Sud|Vico]] (a village north of [[Ajaccio]], Corsica). They had two sons, Pierre (born in 1985), now a hip-hop producer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Indrisek |first=Scott |url=http://blog.rhapsody.com/2008/01/pierre-sarkozy-hip-hop-producer.html |title=Pierre Sarkozy: Hip-Hop Producer|publisher=Rhapsody Blog|date=7 January 2008|accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jean Sarkozy|Jean]] (born in 1986) now a local politician in the city of Neuilly-sur-Seine where Sarkozy started his own political career. Sarkozy's best man was the prominent right-wing politician [[Charles Pasqua]], later to become a political opponent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,476255-2,00.html Sarkozy Closes in on his Goal: Ambition and Honesty on the French Campaign Trail] Spiegel.de, 4 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Sarkozy divorced Culioli in 1996, after they had been separated for several years.

====Cécilia Ciganer-Albéniz====
As mayor of [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], Sarkozy met former fashion model and public relations executive [[Cécilia Attias|Cécilia Ciganer-Albéniz]] (great-granddaughter of composer [[Isaac Albéniz]] and daughter of a Moldovan father), when he officiated at her wedding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cécilia Sarkozy: The First Lady vanishes|date=24 June 2007|work=The Independent |location=UK |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/europe/ccilia-sarkozy-the-first-lady-vanishes-454247.html | location=London | accessdate=31 March 2010 |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=December 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; to television host [[Jacques Martin (TV host)|Jacques Martin]]. In 1988, she left her husband for Sarkozy, and divorced Martin one year later. Sarkozy married her in October 1996, with witnesses [[Martin Bouygues]] and [[Bernard Arnault]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netglimse.com/celebs/pages/cecilia_sarkozy/index.shtml |title=Cecilia Sarkozy Biography|publisher=NetGlimse.com |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have one son, Louis, born 23 April 1997.

Between 2002 and 2005, the couple often appeared together on public occasions, with Cécilia Sarkozy acting as the chief aide for her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wyatt |first=Caroline |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6656717.stm |title=Sarkozy soap opera grips Paris |publisher=BBC News  |date=15 May 2007 |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 May 2005, however, the Swiss newspaper ''[[Le Matin (Switzerland)|Le Matin]]'' revealed that she had left Sarkozy for French-Moroccan national [[Richard Attias]], head of [[Publicis]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huliq.com/38585/nicolas-sarkozy-divorce-official |title=Nicolas Sarkozy divorce official|publisher=HULIQ|date=18 October 2007 |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were other accusations of a private nature in ''Le Matin'', which led to Sarkozy [[lawsuit|suing]] the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaljournalist.org/stories/2005/12/01/french-roast-served-up-american-style/ |title=Globaljournalist.org |publisher=Global Journalist |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, he was said to have had an affair with a journalist of ''[[Le Figaro]]'', [[Anne Fulda]].&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph3&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=The Daily Telegraph |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=SNKICWL0BRPGRQFIQMGCFFWAVCBQUIV0?xml=/news/2006/02/19/wsark19.xml&amp;page=2|title=The Sarkozy saga|accessdate=12 August 2007 | location=UK | first=Kim | last=Willsher | date=19 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarkozy and Cécilia ultimately divorced on 15 October 2007, soon after his election as President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.forbes.com/afxnewslimited/feeds/afx/2007/10/18/afx4234519.html |title=French president Sarkozy separation is 'divorce' – official UPDATE|author=AFX News Limited|work=Forbes magazine |date=18 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal wealth===
Sarkozy declared to the [[Constitutional Council (France)|Constitutional Council]] a [[net worth]] of €2&amp;nbsp;million, most of the assets being in the form of [[life insurance]] policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |coauthor=AFP |title=L'homme qui valait 2 millions |trans_title=The man worth 2 million |work=Libération |location=France |language=French |date=11 May 2007 |url=http://www.liberation.fr/politiques/010119057-l-homme-qui-valait-2-millions  |accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the French President, one of his first actions was to give himself a pay rise: his yearly salary went from €101,000 to €240,000 (to match his European/French peers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jon Boyle |title=Jokes and anger in France over Sarkozy pay rise |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKL3132522020071031 |agency=Reuters   UK |date=31 October 2007 |accessdate=12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also entitled to a mayoral pension as a former mayor of [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]].

==Member of National Assembly==
Sarkozy is recognised by both the right and left's French parties as a skilled politician and striking [[orator]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;French Populism&quot;, by Ignacio Ramonet, [[Le Monde Diplomatique]], June 2007 Edition, [http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2007/06/RAMONET/14842 French version] {{Fr icon}}, [http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/053107G.shtml English translation] {{En icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His supporters within France emphasize his [[charisma]], political innovation and willingness to &quot;make a dramatic break&quot; amid mounting disaffection against &quot;politics as usual&quot;. Overall, he is considered more pro-United States and pro-Israeli than most French politicians.

Since November 2004, Sarkozy has been president of the [[Union for a Popular Movement|Union pour un Mouvement Populaire]] (UMP), France's major right-wing political party, and he was [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]] in the government of [[Dominique de Villepin]], with the honorific title of [[Minister of State]], making him effectively the number three official in the French State after President [[Jacques Chirac]] and the prime minister. His ministerial responsibilities included law enforcement and working to co-ordinate relationships between the national and local governments, as well as [[Minister of Worship (France)|Minister of Worship]] (in this role he created the [[French Council of the Muslim Faith|CFCM]], French Council of Muslim Faith). Previously, he was a deputy to the [[French National Assembly]]. He was forced to resign this position in order to accept his ministerial appointment. He previously also held several ministerial posts, including [[Finance Minister]].

===In government===
Sarkozy's political career began when he was 23, when he became a city councillor in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]]. A member of the [[Neo-Gaullist]] party RPR, he went on to be elected mayor of that town, after the death of the incumbent mayor [[Achille Peretti]]. Sarkozy had been close to Peretti, as his mother was Peretti's secretary. The senior RPR politician at the time, [[Charles Pasqua]], wanted to become mayor, and asked Sarkozy to organize his campaign. Instead Sarkozy profited from Pasqua's short illness to propel himself into the office of mayor.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Le Parisien]]'', 11 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He was the youngest mayor of any town in France with a population of over 50,000. He served from 1983 to 2002. In 1988, he became a deputy in the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]].

In 1993, Sarkozy was in the national news for personally negotiating with the &quot;Human Bomb&quot;, a man who had taken small children hostage in a [[kindergarten]] in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine|Neuilly]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesWin&quot;&gt;{{cite news

|date = 7 May 2007
|accessdate=8 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Human Bomb&quot; was killed after two days of talks by [[French National Police|policemen]] of the [[Recherche Assistance Intervention Dissuasion|RAID]], who entered the school stealthily while the attacker was resting.

At the same time, from 1993 to 1995, he was Minister for the Budget and spokesman for the executive in the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Édouard Balladur]]. Throughout most of his early career, Sarkozy had been seen as a protégé of [[Jacques Chirac]]. During his tenure, he increased France's public debt more than any other French Budget Minister, by the equivalent of €200&amp;nbsp;billion (USD260&amp;nbsp;billion) (FY 1994–1996). The first two budgets he submitted to the parliament (budgets for FY1994 and FY1995) assumed a yearly budget deficit equivalent to six percent of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Dette publique de la France|Dette publique de la France]] {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Maastricht Treaty]], the French yearly budget deficit may not exceed three percent of France's GDP.

In 1995, he spurned Chirac and backed [[Édouard Balladur]] for [[President of France]]. After Chirac won the election, Sarkozy lost his position as Minister for the Budget, and found himself outside the circles of power.

However, he returned after the right-wing defeat at the [[French legislative election, 1997|1997 parliamentary election]], as the number two candidate of the RPR. When the party leader [[Philippe Séguin]] resigned, in 1999, he took the leadership of the Neo-Gaullist party. But it obtained its worst result at the [[European Parliament election, 1999 (France)|1999 European Parliament election]], winning 12.7% of the votes, less than the dissident [[Rally for France]] of Charles Pasqua. Sarkozy lost the RPR leadership.
[[Image:Sarkozy-congres-ump.jpg|thumb|Nicolas Sarkozy speaking at the congress of his party, 28 November 2004]]
In 2002, however, after his re-election as President of the French Republic (see [[French presidential election, 2002]]), Chirac appointed Sarkozy as French Minister of the Interior in the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]], despite Sarkozy's support of Edouard Balladur for French President in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouthindependent.com/archives/2007/10/french-presiden.html Sauced Sarkozy] Felice E. Baker, The Dartmouth Independent, 31 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Following Chirac's 14 July keynote speech on road safety, Sarkozy as interior minister pushed through new legislation leading to the mass purchase of speed cameras and a campaign to increase the awareness of dangers on the roads.

In the cabinet reshuffle of 30 April 2004, Sarkozy became Finance Minister. Tensions continued to build between Sarkozy and Chirac and within the UMP party, as Sarkozy's intentions of becoming head of the party after the resignation of [[Alain Juppé]] became clear.

In party elections of 10 November 2004, Sarkozy became leader of the UMP with 85% of the vote. In accordance with an agreement with Chirac, he resigned as Finance Minister. Sarkozy's ascent was marked by the division of UMP between ''sarkozystes'', such as Sarkozy's &quot;first lieutenant&quot;, [[Brice Hortefeux]], and Chirac loyalists, such as [[Jean-Louis Debré]].

Sarkozy was made Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur (Knight of the [[Legion of Honour]]) by President Chirac in February 2005. He was re-elected on 13 March 2005 to the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]] (as required by the constitution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/english/8ab.asp#TITLE%20III |title=French Constitution, article 23 |publisher=Assemblee Nationale|accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; he had to resign as a deputy when he became minister in 2002).

On 31 May 2005 the main French news radio station ''[[France Info]]'' reported a rumour that Sarkozy was to be reappointed Minister of the Interior in the government of [[Dominique de Villepin]] without resigning from the UMP leadership. This was confirmed on 2 June 2005, when the members of the government were officially announced.

===First term as Minister of the Interior===

Towards the end of his first term as Minister of the Interior, in 2004, Sarkozy was the most divisive conservative politician in France, according to polls conducted at the beginning of 2004.

Sarkozy has sought to ease the sometimes tense relationships between the general French population and the [[Islam in France|Muslim community]]. Unlike the Catholic Church in France with their official leaders or Protestants with their umbrella organisations, the French Muslim community had a lack of structure with no group that could legitimately deal with the French government on their behalf. Sarkozy supported the foundation in May 2003 of the private non-profit [[French Council of the Muslim Faith|Conseil français du culte musulman]] (&quot;French Council of the Muslim Faith&quot;), an organisation meant to be representative of French Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Journal Officiel de la République Française|JO associations]]'', 28 May 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Sarkozy has suggested amending the [[1905 French law on the separation of Church and State|1905 law on the separation of Church and State]], mostly in order to be able to finance mosques and other Muslim institutions with public funds&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=19272&amp;sec=59&amp;con=2 WorldWide Religious News]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that they are less reliant on money from outside of France. It was not followed by any concrete measure.

===Minister of Finance===
During his short appointment as [[Minister of Finance (France)|Minister of Finance]], Sarkozy was responsible for introducing a number of policies. The degree to which this reflected ''libéralisme'' (a hands-off approach to running the economy) or more traditional French state ''dirigisme'' (intervention) is controversial. He resigned the day following his election as president of the [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]].

* In September 2004, Sarkozy oversaw the reduction of the government ownership stake in [[France Télécom]] from 50.4 percent to 41 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Thorel |first=Jerome |title=Le gouvernement finalise la privatisation de France Télécom |language=French |publisher=ZDNet France |date=1 September 2004 |url=http://www.zdnet.fr/actualites/business/0,39020715,39169571,00.htm |accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sarkozy backed a partial [[nationalisation]] of the large engineering company [[Alstom]] decided by his predecessor when the company was exposed to bankruptcy in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bruxelles valide le sauvetage d'Alstom |work=[[L'Expansion]] |publisher=[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]] |location=France |language=French |date=22 September 2003 |url=http://www.lexpansion.com/art/17.363.70036.0.html |accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In June 2004, Sarkozy reached an agreement with the major retail chains in France to concertedly lower prices on household goods by an average of two percent; the success of this measure is disputed, with studies suggesting that the decrease was close to one percent in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Grande distribution&amp;nbsp;: l'accord Sarkozy à moitié appliqué |work=L'Expansion |publisher=L'Express |location=France |language=French |date=30 September 2004 |url=http://www.lexpansion.com/art/2576.78716.0.html |accessdate=18 March 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Taxes: Sarkozy avoided taking a position on the ISF ([[solidarity tax on wealth]]). This is considered an ideological symbol by many on the [[political left|left]] and [[political right|right]]. Some in the business world and on the liberal right, such as [[Alain Madelin]], wanted it abolished. For Sarkozy, that would have risked being categorised by the left as a gift to the richest classes of society at a time of economic difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Martine |first=Gilson |title=ISF, la tentation des députés |trans_title=press review |work=Le Nouvel Observateur |location=France |language=French |date=20 May 2004 |url=http://www.nouvelobs.com/articles/p2063/a241461.html |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20050208204557/http://www.nouvelobs.com/articles/p2063/a241461.html |archivedate=8 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Villepin government===
===Second term as Minister of the Interior===
[[Image:2006 09 12 sarkozy 600.jpg|thumb|Sarkozy as Minister of the Interior with then U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]], after their bilateral meeting in Washington, D.C., 12 September 2006]]
During his second term at the Ministry of the Interior, Sarkozy was initially more discreet about his ministerial activities: instead of focusing on his own topic of law and order, many of his declarations addressed wider issues, since he was expressing his opinions as head of the UMP party.

{{Main|Response to the 2005 civil unrest in France}}
However, the [[2005 civil unrest in France|civil unrest in autumn 2005]] put law enforcement in the spotlight again. Sarkozy was accused of having provoked the unrest by calling young delinquents from [[housing project]]s &quot;rabble&quot; ''(&quot;[[racaille]]&quot;)'' in [[Argenteuil]] near Paris, and controversially suggested [[ethnic cleansing|cleansing]] the minority suburbs with a [[Kärcher]]. After the accidental death of two youths, which sparked the riots, Sarkozy first blamed it on &quot;hoodlums&quot; and gangsters. These remarks were sharply criticised by many on the left wing and by a member of his own government, Delegate Minister for Equal Opportunities [[Azouz Begag]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=921072 Azouz Begag, principal opposant à Nicolas Sarkozy], ''[[Le Monde]]'', 2 November 2005 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the rioting, he made a number of announcements on future policy: selection of immigrants, &lt;!--better/worse--&gt; greater tracking of immigrants, and a reform on the 1945 ordinance government justice measures for young delinquents.

===UMP leader===
Before he was elected President of France, Sarkozy was president of [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]], the French conservative party, elected with 85 percent of the vote. During his presidency, the number of members has significantly increased. In 2005, he supported a &quot;yes&quot; vote in the [[French referendum on the European Constitution]], but the &quot;No&quot; vote won.

Throughout 2005, Sarkozy called for radical changes in France's economic and social policies. These calls culminated in an interview with ''[[Le Monde]]'' on 8 September 2005, during which he claimed that the French had been misled for 30 years by false promises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sarkozyblog.free.fr/index.php?2005/09/07/170-le-meilleur-pour-la-france |title=Interview with ',Le Monde',, 8 September 2005 |publisher=Sarkozy Blog|date=19 September 2004 |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other issues:
* he called for a simplified and &quot;fairer&quot; [[tax code|taxation system]], with fewer loopholes and a maximum taxation rate (all ''direct'' taxes combined) at 50 percent of revenue;
* he approved measures reducing or denying social support to [[unemployment|unemployed]] workers who refuse work offered to them;
* he pressed for a reduction in the [[budget deficit]], claiming that the French state has been living off [[credit (finance)|credit]] for some time.

Such policies are what are called in France ''libéral'' (that is, in favour of [[laissez-faire]] economic policies) or, with a pejorative undertone, ''ultra-libéral''. Sarkozy rejects this label of ''libéral'' and prefers to call himself a pragmatist.

Sarkozy opened another avenue of controversy by declaring that he wanted a reform of the immigration system, with [[:wikt:quota|quota]]s designed to admit the skilled workers needed by the French economy. He also wants to reform the current French system for foreign students, saying that it enables foreign students to take open-ended curricula in order to obtain residency in France; instead, he wants to select the best students to the best curricula in France.

In early 2006, the [[French parliament]] adopted a controversial bill known as [[DADVSI]], which reforms [[French copyright law]]. Since his party was divided on the issue, Sarkozy stepped in and organised meetings between various parties involved. Later, groups such as the Odebi League and EUCD.info alleged that Sarkozy personally and unofficially supported certain amendments to the law, which enacted strong penalties against designers of [[peer-to-peer]] systems.

[[Image:Segolene Royal Arcueil 18 septembre 2010 6.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Ségolène Royal]] was Sarkozy's opponent during the presidential election.]]
Sarkozy was a likely candidate for the presidency in 2007; in an often-repeated comment made on television channel [[France 2]], when asked by a journalist whether he thought about the presidential election when he shaved in the morning, Sarkozy commented, &quot;not just when I shave&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtl.fr/rtlinfo/article.asp?dicid=159060 Broadcast of &quot;France 2&quot;], 19 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 January 2007, Sarkozy was chosen by the [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] to be its candidate in the 2007 presidential election. Sarkozy, who was running unopposed, won 98 percent of the votes. Of the 327,000 UMP members who could vote, 69 percent participated in the online ballot.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6260275.stm Sarkozy nod for presidential run]&quot;, ''BBC News'', 14 January 2007. Retrieved 14 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, Sarkozy appeared on a televised debate on [[TF1]] where he expressed his support for [[affirmative action]] and the freedom to work overtime. Despite his opposition to [[same-sex marriage]], he advocated [[civil unions]] and the possibility for same-sex partners to inherit under the same regime as married couples. The law was voted in July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;It was included in the ''paquet fiscal'' that has been one of the first laws passed in Parliament&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 February, Sarkozy decided in favour of a projected second, non-[[nuclear power|nuclear]], [[Future French aircraft carrier|aircraft carrier]] for the national Navy (adding to the nuclear [[Charles de Gaulle (R 91)|''Charles de Gaulle'']]), during an official visit in [[Toulon]] with Defence Minister [[Michèle Alliot-Marie]]. &quot;This would allow permanently having an operational ship, taking into account the constraints of maintenance&quot;, he explained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marianne2007.info/index.php?id_plugin=266&amp;path=newsAFP/page2News.php&amp;ftpUrl=070207164849.bmmbl7vt.txt&amp;pos=1&amp;action=plugin Sarkozy pour un deuxième porte-avions français] (AFP)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 March, President Jacques Chirac announced his support for Sarkozy. Chirac pointed out that Sarkozy had been chosen as presidential candidate for the ruling UMP party, and said: &quot;So it is totally natural that I give him my vote and my support.&quot; To focus on his campaign, Sarkozy stepped down as interior minister on 26 March.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/3/21/92845.shtml?s=os France's Jacques Chirac Backs Nicolas Sarkozy]. 21 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the campaign, rival candidates had accused Sarkozy of being a &quot;candidate for brutality&quot; and of presenting hard-line views about France's future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6566649.stm French confused over the real Sarkozy]. 18 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents also accused him of courting conservative voters in policy-making in a bid to capitalise on right-wing sentiments among some communities. However, his popularity was sufficient to see him polling as the frontrunner throughout the later campaign period, consistently ahead of rival Socialist candidate, Ségolène Royal.

The first round of the presidential election was held on 22 April 2007. Sarkozy came in first with 31.18 percent of the votes, ahead of [[Ségolène Royal]] of the Socialists with 25.87 percent. In the second round, Sarkozy came out on top to win the election with 53.06 percent of the votes ahead of [[Ségolène Royal]] with 46.94 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Élection présidentielle de 2007—[http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/PR2007/FE.html résultats définitifs] French Ministry of the Interior&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech immediately following the announcement of the election results, Sarkozy stressed the need for France's modernisation, but also called for national unity, mentioning that Royal was in his thoughts. In that speech, he claimed &quot;The French have chosen to break with the ideas, habits and behaviour of the past. I will restore the value of work, authority, merit and respect for the nation.&quot;

==Presidency==
{{Main|Presidency of Nicolas Sarkozy}}

On 6 May 2007, Nicolas Sarkozy became the sixth person to be elected President of the Fifth Republic (which was established in 1958), and the 23rd president in French history. He is the first French president to have been born after World War II.

The official transfer of power from Jacques Chirac took place on 16 May at 11:00&amp;nbsp;am (9:00 UTC) at the [[Élysée Palace]], where he was given the authorization codes of the [[Force de Frappe|French nuclear arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Samuel |first=Henry |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/05/17/wfra17.xml |title=Radiant Cécilia puts Sarkozy in the shade |work=Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=17 May 2007 |accessdate=9 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the afternoon, the new President flew to Berlin to meet with German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]].

Under Sarkozy's government, [[François Fillon]] replaced [[Dominique de Villepin]] as Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais_attente/salle_de_presse/communique_concernant_la_nommination_du_premier_ministre.76689.html Communiqué de la Présidence de la République concernant la nomination du Premier ministre.] ''[[Élysée Palace]]'', 17 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Sarkozy appointed [[Bernard Kouchner]], the left-wing founder of [[Médecins Sans Frontières]], as his foreign minister, leading to Kouchner's expulsion from the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]]. In addition to Kouchner, three more Sarkozy ministers are from the left, including [[Eric Besson]], who served as [[Ségolène Royal]]'s economic adviser at the beginning of her campaign. Sarkozy also appointed seven women to form a total cabinet of 15; one, Justice Minister [[Rachida Dati]], is the first woman of Northern African origin to serve in a French cabinet. Of the 15, two attended the elite [[École nationale d'administration]] (ENA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9226982 France's New Government – A study in perpetual motion], ''[[The Economist]]'', 23 June 2007 {{En icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ministers were reorganised, with the controversial creation of a 'Ministry of Immigration, Integration, National Identity and Co-Development'—given to his right-hand man [[Brice Hortefeux]]—and of a 'Ministry of Budget, Public Accounts and Civil Administration'—handed out to [[Éric Wœrth]], supposed to prepare the replacement of only a third of all civil servants who retire. However, after the 17 June parliamentary elections, the Cabinet has been adjusted to 15 ministers and 16 deputy ministers, totalling 31 officials.

Shortly after taking office, Sarkozy began negotiations with Colombian president [[Álvaro Uribe]] and the left-wing [[guerrilla]] [[FARC]], regarding the release of hostages held by the rebel group, especially Franco-Colombian politician [[Ingrid Betancourt]]. According to some sources, Sarkozy himself asked for Uribe to release FARC's &quot;chancellor&quot; [[Rodrigo Granda]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacronica.com/EdicionEnLinea/Notas/Internacional/08062007/244942.aspx Llama G8 a FARC contribuir a liberación de rehenes], ''La Cronica'', 8 June 2007 {{Es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he announced on 24 July 2007, that French and European representatives had obtained the extradition of the [[HIV trial in Libya|Bulgarian nurses detained in Libya]] to their country. In exchange, he signed with [[Muammar Gaddafi]] security, health care and immigration pacts—and a $230&amp;nbsp;million (168&amp;nbsp;million euros) [[MILAN]] antitank missile sale.&lt;ref name=&quot;WP Moore&quot;&gt;Molly Moore, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/03/AR2007080301950.html France's Sarkozy Off to a Running Start], ''[[Washington Post]]'', 4 August 2007 {{En icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contract was the first made by Libya since 2004, and was negotiated with [[MBDA]], a subsidiary of [[EADS]].

On 8 June 2007, during the [[33rd G8 summit]] in [[Heiligendamm]], Sarkozy set a goal of reducing French [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] emissions by 50 percent by 2050 in order to prevent [[global warming]]. He then pushed forward Socialist [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]] as European nominee to the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/economie/20070710.WWW000000271_fmi_strauss_kahn_candidat_officiel_de_lunion_europeenne.html FMI: Strauss-Kahn candidat officiel de l'Union européenne], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 10 July 2007 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics alleged that Sarkozy proposed to nominate Strauss-Kahn as managing director of the IMF to deprive the Socialist Party of one of its more popular figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSPAB00331220070707 France's Sarkozy wants Strauss-Kahn as IMF head] [[Reuters]], 7 July 2007 {{En icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP), Sarkozy's party, won a majority at the [[French legislative election, 2007|June 2007 legislative election]], although by less than expected. In July, the UMP majority, seconded by the ''[[Nouveau Centre]]'', ratified one of Sarkozy's electoral promises, which was to partially revoke the [[inheritance tax]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/pratique-patrimoine/20070713.FIG000000211_les_deputes_votent_la_quasi_suppression_des_droits_de_succession.html Les députés votent la quasi-suppression des droits de succession], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 13 July 2007 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/actualite/politiques/266891.FR.php Les droits de succession (presque) supprimés], ''[[Libération]]'', 13 July 2007 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inheritance tax formerly brought eight billion euros into state coffers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanite.fr/2007-06-07_Politique_Droits-de-succession-pour-une-minorite-de-menages-aises Droits de succession: pour une minorité de ménages aisés], ''[[L'Humanité]]'', 7 June 2007 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:G8 summit in L'Aquila, family photo.jpg|thumb|Sarkozy (at left) attending the [[35th G8 summit|G-8 Summit]] in 2009]]
Sarkozy's UMP majority prepared a budget that reduced taxes, in particular for [[upper middle-class]] people, allegedly in an effort to [[Supply-side economics|boost GDP growth]], but did not reduce state expenditures.&lt;!-- The vote of the budget hasn't taken place yet !! --&gt; He was criticised by the European Commission for doing so.

Sarkozy broke with the custom of [[amnesty]]ing traffic tickets and of releasing thousands of prisoners from overcrowded jails on [[Bastille Day]], a tradition that [[Napoleon]] had started in 1802 to commemorate the [[storming of the Bastille]] during the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WP Moore&quot; /&gt;

Sarkozy's government issued a [[decree]] on 7 August 2007 to generalise a voluntary [[biometric]] profiling program of travellers in airports. The program, called 'Parafes', was to use fingerprints. The [[governmental databases|new database]] would be interconnected with the [[Schengen Information System]] (SIS) as well as with a national database of wanted persons ([[FPR]]). The Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés ([[CNIL]]) protested against this new decree, opposing itself to the recording of fingerprints and to the interconnection between the SIS and the FPR.&lt;ref name=Parafes&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-942808@51-931629,0.html Généralisation du fichage biométrique volontaire des voyageurs dans les aéroports français], ''[[Le Monde]]'', 8 August 2007 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 July 2008, the French parliament passed constitutional reforms which Sarkozy had made one of the key pledges of his presidential campaign. The vote was 539 to 357, one vote over the three-fifths majority required; the changes are not yet finalized. They would introduce a two-term limit for the presidency, and end the president's right of collective pardon. They would allow the president to address parliament in-session, and parliament, to set its own agenda. They would give parliament a veto over some presidential appointments, while ending government control over parliament's committee system. He has claimed that these reforms strengthen parliament, while some opposition socialist lawmakers have described it as a &quot;consolidation of a monocracy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;France backs constitution reform; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7517505.stm France backs constitution reform] BBC News, 21 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 July 2008, parliament voted the &quot;loi de modernisation de l'économie&quot; (Modernization of the Economy Law) which loosened restrictions on retail prices and reduced limitations on the creation of businesses. The Government has also made changes to long-standing French work-hour regulations, allowing employers to negotiate overtime with employees and making all hours worked past the traditional French 35-hour week tax-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displayStory.cfm?source=hptextfeature&amp;story_id=11792306|title=France—The reformist president|date=24 July 2008|accessdate=27 July 2008|work=The Economist }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as a result of the [[global financial crisis of 2008|global financial crisis]] that came to a head in September 2008, Sarkozy has returned to the [[state interventionism]] of his predecessors, declaring that &quot;laissez-faire capitalism is over&quot; and denouncing the &quot;[[dictatorship]] of the market&quot;.

France wielded special international power when Sarkozy held the rotating EU Presidency from July 2008 through December 2008. Sarkozy has publicly stated his intention to attain EU approval of a [[progressivism|progressive]] energy package before the end of his EU Presidency. This energy package would clearly define climate change objectives for the EU and hold members to specific reductions in emissions. In further support of his collaborative outlook on climate change, Sarkozy has led the EU into a partnership with China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eubusiness.com/China/climate-change.23 New chapter opens in EU-China Climate Change Partnership] EUbusiness.com, 29 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 December 2008, Nicolas Sarkozy, current Chairman of the European Union, met the [[Tenzin Gyatso|Dalai Lama]] in Poland and outraged China, which has announced that it would postpone the China-EU summit indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hm4uz6lCdhPdwJhNTl63SxPrkKhA |title=France's Sarkozy meets Dalai Lama as China fumes |publisher=Google |date=6 December 2008 |accessdate=9 March 2010|agency=AFP}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 April 2009, at the [[NATO]] Summit in [[Strasbourg]], Sarkozy announced that France would offer [[Right of asylum|asylum]] to a former [[Guantanamo captive]].&lt;ref name=HoustonChronicle2009-04-02&gt;

===Involvement in Libya===
[[File:Nicolas Sarkozy addresses the E-G8 Forum.jpg|thumb|Nicolas Sarkozy address the E-G8 Forum in Paris in 2011]]
In March 2011, after having been criticized for his unwillingness to support the Egyptian and Tunisian revolutions, and persuaded by the philosopher [[Bernard-Henri Levy]] to have France actively engage against the forces of the Libyan leader, [[Muammar Gaddafi]], Nicolas Sarkozy was amongst the first Heads of State to demand the resignation of Gaddafi and his government, which was then fighting a civil war in [[Libya]]. On 10 March 2011, Nicolas Sarkozy welcomed to the Elysee Palace, three emissaries from the Libyan Transitory Rebel Council (CNTT), brought to him by Bernard-Henri Levy who mediated at the meeting. Nicolas Sarkozy promised them a no-fly zone would be imposed on Gaddafi's aeroplanes. He also promised them France's military assistance. On 17 March 2011, at the behest of France, resolution 1973 was adopted by the Security Council of the United Nations, permitting the creation of a &quot;no fly&quot; zone over Libya, and for the undertaking of &quot;necessary measures&quot; for the protection of the country's civilian population. On 19 March 2011, Nicolas Sarkozy officially announced the beginning of a military intervention in Libya, with France's participation. These actions of Nicolas Sarkozy were favorably received by the majority of the French political class and public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lejdd.fr/International/Actualite/La-Libye-un-veritable-succes-diplomatique-pour-Sarkozy-285403/ |title=La Libye, un véritable succès diplomatique pour Sarkozy? |publisher=leJDD.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=2011-12-12#folio=CV1] &quot;No Exit&quot; by Philip Gourevitch, 12 December 2011, New Yorker&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/02/world/africa/02levy.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Steven | last=Erlanger | title=In His Telling, One Man Made Libya a French Cause | date=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' journalist Colin Randall has highlighted Sarkozy's tighter control of his image and frequent interventions in the media: &quot;he censors a book, or fires the chief editor of a weekly.&quot;&lt;ref name=Leprince/&gt; Sarkozy is reported by Reuters to be sensitive about his height (believed to be {{convert|165|cm|ftin|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Socialists say Sarkozy has &quot;small man syndrome&quot; | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL2186523220070921 |agency=Reuters   | date=21 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The French media have pointed out that [[Sarkosy#Carla Bruni|Carla Bruni]] frequently wears flats when in public with him. In 2009, this was the subject of a political row, when a worker at a factory where Sarkozy gave a speech said she was asked to stand next to him because she was of a similar height (this story was corroborated by some trade union officials). The president's office called the accusation &quot;completely absurd and grotesque&quot;, while the Socialist Party mocked his fastidious preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8243486.stm#graphic|title=Sarkozy height row grips France |publisher=BBC News |date=8 August 2009|accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarkozy lost a suit against a manufacturer of Sarkozy [[voodoo doll]]s, in which he claimed that he had a right to his own image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/10/30/europe/france.php &quot;France enjoys Sarkozy's voodoo doll setback&quot;] by Katrin Bennhold, [[International Herald Tribune]], 30 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
{{Criticism section|date=May 2011}}
Generally, Sarkozy is strongly disliked by the Left, and is also criticised by some on the Right, most vocally by supporters of [[Jacques Chirac]] and [[Dominique de Villepin]], such as [[Jean-Louis Debré]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marianne2007.info/Cette-droite-qui-dit-non-a-Sarkozy_a313.html|title=Cette droite qui dit &quot;non&quot; à Sarkozy|publisher=Marianne2007.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la-croix.com/article/index.jsp?docId=2288253&amp;rubId=4076|title=Boutin renonce à se présenter et soutient Sarkozy|work=La Croix |location=France}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine ''[[Marianne (magazine)|Marianne]]'' accused Sarkozy of changing opinion in an [[Airbus]] affair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:kUwVpYZ23QMJ:www.marianne2.fr/Le-retournement-de-Sarkozy-sur-Airbus_a884.html Marianne – Le retournement de Sarkozy sur la recapitulisation de la société Airbus], 5 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[French Communist Party|communist]]-leaning magazine ''[[L'Humanité]]'' accused Sarkozy of being a [[populism|populist]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[L'Humanité]]'', [http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/2005-06-11/2005-06-11-808328 Humanite.presse.fr], 11 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Anti Sarko 480342767 8b13c8532f o d.jpg|thumb|Many on the Left have a particular distrust for Nicolas Sarkozy; specific &quot;anti-Sarko&quot; movements have been started]]

In 2004 Sarkozy co-authored a book, ''La République, les religions, l'espérance'' (''The Republic, Religions, and Hope''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|coauthors=Thibaud Collin, Philippe Verdin|last=Sarkozy|first=Nicolas|title=La République, les religions, l'espérance|publisher=[[Les éditions du Cerf]]|year=2004|isbn=2204072834}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he argued that the young should not be brought up solely on secular or [[republicanism|republican]] values. He advocated reducing the [[separation of church and state]], arguing for the government [[subsidy]] of mosques in order to encourage Islamic integration into French society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=L'Etat Doit-Il Financer La Construction de Mosquées&amp;nbsp;?|publisher=Libres.org|language=French|date=2 July 2007|url=http://www.libres.org/francais/actualite/archives/actualit%E9_1004/mosquees_a5_4504.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opposes financing of religious institutions with funds from outside France. After meeting with [[Tom Cruise]], Sarkozy was criticised by some for meeting with a member of the [[Church of Scientology]], which is seen as a cult in France (see [[Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Worldwide Religious News'', 2 September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Sarkozy stated that &quot;the roots of France are essentially Christian&quot; at December 2007 speech in Rome. He called [[Islam]] &quot;one of the greatest and most beautiful civilizations the world has known&quot; at a speech in [[Riyadh]] in January 2008. Both comments drew criticism from Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=French President's religious mixing riles critics|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/french.presidents.religious.mixing.riles.critics/16423.htm|date=23 January 2008|work=Christianity Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the midst of a tense period and following the accidental death of an 11-year-old boy in the Paris suburb of [[La Courneuve]] in June 2005, Sarkozy quoted a local resident and vowed to clean the area out &quot;with a [[Kärcher]]&quot; (''nettoyer la cité au Kärcher'', referring to a well-known German brand of pressure-cleaning equipment), and two days before the [[2005 civil unrest in France|2005 Paris riots]] he referred to the criminal youth of the housing projects as ''voyous'' (thugs) and ''racaille'', a slang term which can be translated into English as ''rabble'', ''scum'' or ''riff-raff'';&lt;ref&gt;answering to a resident who addressed Sarkozy with &quot;''Quand nous débarrassez-vous de cette racaille ?''&quot; (When will you rid us of these dregs?) – {{cite news|title=Banlieues&amp;nbsp;: filmer et raconter avec Françoise Laborde, Claude Dilain, Nicolas Comte, Guillaume Biet (Les videos)|work=Arrêt sur images|language=French|publisher=[[France 5]]|date=6 November 2005|url=http://www.france5.fr/asi/007548/10/129836.cfm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070703031423/http://www.france5.fr/asi/007548/10/129836.cfm|archivedate=3 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[French Communist Party]]'s publication ''L'Humanité'' branded this language as inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nicolas Sarkozy pompier pyromane|work=L'Humanité |location=France|date=2 November 2005|url=http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/2005-11-02/2005-11-02-817109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005 Sarkozy was accused of pushing for a hasty inquiry into an arson attack on a police station in [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]], of which the alleged perpetrators were [[acquittal|acquitted]] for lack of proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Incendie de Pau&amp;nbsp;: les 8 accusés acquittés|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=Le Nouvel Observateur |location=France|language=French|date=1 October 2005|url=http://permanent.nouvelobs.com/societe/20051001.OBS0822.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080529212216rn_1/archquo.nouvelobs.com/cgi/articles?ad=societe/20051001.OBS0822.html&amp;host=http://permanent.nouvelobs.com/|archivedate=29 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 June 2005 Sarkozy told law enforcement officials that he had questioned the Minister of Justice about the future of &quot;the judge&quot; who had freed a man on [[parole]] who had later committed a murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicolas Sarkozy veut faire &quot;&amp;nbsp;payer&amp;nbsp;&quot; un juge pour &quot;&amp;nbsp;sa faute&amp;nbsp;&quot;|work=Le Monde|language=French|format=Fee required for full article|date=23 June 2005|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-665357@51-660372,0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarkozy opposed the U.S.-led [[Iraq War|invasion of Iraq]]. However, he was critical of the way Jacques Chirac and his foreign minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] expressed France's opposition to the war. Talking at the French-American Foundation in Washington, D.C. on 12 September 2006, he denounced what he called the &quot;French arrogance&quot; and said: &quot;It is bad manners to embarrass one's allies or sound like one is taking delight in their troubles.&quot;&lt;ref name=Iraq_speech&gt;{{Fr icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/actualite/politiques/205032.FR.php|title=Chirac juge &quot;lamentable&quot; l'atlantisme de Sarkozy|author=[[Libération]]|date=18 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added: &quot;We must never again turn our disagreements into a crisis.&quot; Jacques Chirac reportedly said in private that Sarkozy's speech was &quot;appalling&quot; and &quot;a shameful act&quot;.&lt;ref name=Iraq_speech/&gt;

Even though his former foreign minister [[Bernard Kouchner]] (excluded from the Socialist party after his inclusion in [[François Fillon]]'s government) had been one of the few supporters in France of removal of [[Saddam Hussein]] from power, Sarkozy's stance on the war has not changed.

A few weeks before the first round of the 2007 presidential elections, Sarkozy said during an interview with philosopher [[Michel Onfray]]&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophie Magazine'', nr 8, April 2007; [http://philomag.com/article,dialogue,nicolas-sarkozy-et-michel-onfray-confidences-entre-ennemis,288.php online extracts]&lt;/ref&gt; that he thinks disorders such as [[paedophilia]] and depression have a [[gene]]tic as well as social basis, saying &quot;I don't agree with you, I'd be inclined to think that one is born a paedophile, and it is actually a problem that we do not know how to cure this disease&quot;; he also claimed that suicides among youth were linked to genetic predispositions by stating, &quot;I don't want to give parents a complex. It's not exclusively the parents' fault every time a youngster commits suicide.&quot; These statements were criticised by some scientists, including controversial geneticist [[Axel Kahn]].&lt;ref&gt;[[L'Humanité]], 4 April 2007, ''[http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/2007-04-04/2007-04-04-848961 « Un gène ne commande jamais un destin humain »]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Le Monde]], 11 April 2007, ''[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-823448,36-894367@51-893376,0.html Tollé dans la communauté scientifique après les propos de Nicolas Sarkozy sur la génétique]''&lt;/ref&gt; Sarkozy later said, &quot;What part is innate and what part is acquired? At least let's debate it, let's not close the door to all debate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'', 10 April 2007, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/france/story/0,,2053956,00.html &quot;Row over Sarkozy's paedophilia comment refuses to go away&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 July 2007, Sarkozy delivered a speech in Senegal, written by Henri Guaino, in which he made reference to &quot;African [[peasant]]s&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;news24Africa&quot;&gt;''News24.com''; 28 July 2007; [http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_2154961,00.html Sarkozy's Africa vision under fire]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardianAfrica&quot;&gt;Chris McGreal;''The Guardian'' (UK) 27 August 2007 [http://www.guardian.co.uk/france/story/0,,2156809,00.html Mbeki criticised for praising 'racist' Sarkozy]&lt;/ref&gt;  The controversial remarks were widely condemned by Africans, who viewed them as racist.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardianAfrica&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Agier, [http://www.vacarme.eu.org/article1493.html l'Afrique en France après le discours de Dakar], ''Vacarme'' n°42 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mgAfrica&quot;&gt;[[Achille Mbembe]]; ''Mail and Guardian (South Africa)''; 27 August 2007; [http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=317571&amp;area=/insight/insight__comment_and_analysis/ Sacré bleu! Mbeki and Sarkozy?]&lt;/ref&gt; South African president [[Thabo Mbeki]] praised Sarkozy's speech, which raised criticism by some in the South African media.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardianAfrica&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mgAfrica&quot;/&gt;

On 23 February 2008, Sarkozy was filmed by a reporter for French newspaper ''[[Le Parisien]]'' having the following exchange while visiting the [[Paris International Agricultural Show]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Premiers pas mouvementés de Sarkozy au salon de l'agriculture|work=vidéos|work=Le Parisien |location=France|language=French|format=[[SWF]]|date=23 February 2008|url=http://videos.leparisien.fr/video/iLyROoaftL1D.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
While quickly crossing the hall Saturday morning, in the middle of the crowd, Sarkozy encounters a recalcitrant visitor who refuses to shake his hand. &quot;Ah no, don't touch me!&quot;, said the man. The president retorted immediately: &quot;Get lost, then.&quot; &quot;You're making me dirty&quot;, yelled the man. With a frozen smile, Sarkozy says, his teeth glistening, a refined &quot;Get lost, then, poor dumb-ass, go.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;In French: ''Lors de sa traversée éclair du salon samedi matin, en plein bain de foule, Sarkozy croise un visiteur récalcitrant qui refuse sa poignée de main. «Ah non, touche-moi pas», prévient-il. Le chef de l'État rétorque sans détour : «Casse-toi, alors.» «Tu me salis», embraye l'homme. Le sourire se crispe. Sarkozy lâche, desserrant à peine les dents, un raffiné «Casse-toi alors, pauv'con, va».''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This exchange has been cause for much humour and debate regarding its propriety in the French press. It should also be noted that a precise translation into English has many possible variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldhammer|first=Arthur|url=http://artgoldhammer.blogspot.com/2008/02/found-on-web.html|title=Found on the web|work=French Politics|publisher=An American observer comments on French politics|date=25 February 2008|accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=713778 &quot;French supporters defend Sarkozy&quot;] [[Agence France-Presse]], 25 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=334307|title=Sarkozy runs afoul of critics with rank reply|author=Crispian Balmer|agency=[[Reuters]]|location=[[Toronto]]|work=National Post |location=Canada |page=A2|date=26 February 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;br&gt;&amp;bull; Article noted at [http://www.fpinfomart.ca/news/ar_results.php?q=1136115&amp;sort=pubd&amp;page=1&amp;n%5Bdb%5D%5B%5D=ntnp&amp;n%5Bby%5D%5B%5D=Crispian+Balmer fpinfomart.ca], but is not available.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 August 2008, Hervé Eon, from [[Laval, Mayenne|Laval]] came to an anti-Sarkozy demonstration with a sign bearing the words ''Casse-toi pov' con'', the exact words Sarkozy had uttered. Eon was arrested for causing offence to the presidential function and the prosecutor, who in France indirectly reports to the president, requested a fine of 1000€.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Poignard |first=Anne-Claire|title=&quot;&amp;nbsp;Casse-toi, pauvre con&amp;nbsp;!&amp;nbsp;&quot;&amp;nbsp;: quatre mots à 1&amp;nbsp;000 euros|work=Le Monde|language=French|format=Fee required for full article|date=24 October 2008|url= http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2008/10/24/casse-toi-pauvre-con-quatre-mots-a-1-000-euros_1110685_823448.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Eon|title=&quot;&amp;nbsp;Casse-toi pov'con&amp;nbsp;&quot;&amp;nbsp;: au tribunal pour outrage au Président|language=French|publisher=[[Rue 89]]|date=4 September 2008|url=http://www.rue89.com/2008/09/04/casse-toi-povcon-au-tribunal-pour-outrage-au-president}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The court eventually imposed a symbolic 30€ suspended fine, which has generally been interpreted as a defeat for the prosecution side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rue89.com/2008/11/06/casse-toi-povcon-30-euros-avec-sursis-pour-herve-eon |title=&quot; Casse-toi pov'con &quot; : 30 euros avec sursis pour Hervé Eon |publisher=Rue89 |date=2008-11-14 |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident was widely reported on, in particular as Sarkozy, as president of the Republic, is [[Sovereign immunity|immune from prosecution]], notably restricting Eon's rights to sue Sarkozy for defamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Raphaëlle Besse Desmoulières|title=Le délit d'outrage est une infraction obsolète|work=Le Monde|language=French|date=23 October 2008|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2008/10/23/le-delit-d-outrage-est-une-infraction-obsolete_1110460_3224.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 November 2009, Sarkozy posted on his Facebook page a picture supposedly showing him chipping away at the [[Berlin Wall]] during its fall. However, the dates were inconsistent and the picture was proven to be fake – and later archived footage confirmed this. This news of forgery spread in France, and later evolved into a meme, &quot;Sarkozy Was There&quot;, where Sarkozy is photoshopped into historical events.

On 5 July 2010, following its investigations on the [[Bettencourt affair]], online newspaper [[Mediapart]] ran an article in which Claire Thibout, an ex-accountant working for [[Liliane Bettencourt]], accused Nicolas Sarkozy and [[Eric Woerth]] of receiving illegal campaign donations in 2007, in cash.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediapart.fr/ ''L'ex-comptable des Bettencourt accuse: des enveloppes d'argent à Woerth et à Sarkozy''], original report, in French&lt;!-- right now on the main page, no other URL --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e72598de-88d5-11df-8925-00144feab49a.html?ftcamp=rss|title=Financial Times article|work=Financial Times |date=6 July 2010|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 July 2010, Sarkozy suggested a new policy of security, and he proposed &quot;stripping foreign-born French citizens who opted to acquire their nationality at their majority of their citizenship if they are convicted of threatening the life of a police officer or other serious crimes&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Casting Out the Un-French&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/06/opinion/06fri2.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nicolas_sarkozy|work=The New York Times|title=Casting Out the Un-French|date=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy has been criticized for example by the US newspaper ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Casting Out the Un-French&quot;/&gt; by Sarkozy's political opponents, including the leader of the [[Socialist Party (France)|PS]], [[Martine Aubry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/politique/securite-aubry-denonce-la-derive-antirepublicaine-de-sarkozy-et-de-sa-majorite-01-08-2010-1221034_20.php |title=Réaction : SÉCURITÉ – Aubry dénonce la &quot;dérive antirépublicaine&quot; de Sarkozy et de sa majorité, actualité Politique : Le Point|work=Le Point |location=France|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by experts of French law, including the ex-member of the [[Constitutional Council of France]], [[Robert Badinter]], who said that such action would be unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2010/08/02/badinter-rappelle-a-sarkozy-l-egalite-de-tous-les-francais-devant-la-loi_1394701_823448.html|title=Badinter rappelle à Sarkozy l'égalité de tous les Français devant la loi|work=Le Monde |location=France|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paris West University Nanterre La Défense''' (''Université Paris Ouest Nanterre La Défense'') formerly called '''Paris X Nanterre''' is a French university in the [[List of public universities in France by academy#Academy of Versailles|Academy of Versailles]]. It is one of the 13 successor universities of the [[University of Paris]]. It is located in the western suburb of [[Nanterre]], near [[La Défense]], the business district of [[Paris]]. It is commonly referred to as '''Nanterre'''.

== History ==
[[File:Nanterre-250x188.jpg|left|thumb|Ths Social Sciences buildings]]
Nanterre was built in the 1960s on the outskirts of [[Paris]] as an extension of the Sorbonne. Based on the [[Anglosphere|American]] model, it was created as a [[campus]] (as opposed to the old French universities which were smaller and integrated to the city they were in). 

Nanterre became famous shortly after its opening by being at the center of the [[French May|May 68 student rebellion]]. The campus was nicknamed &quot;Nanterre, la folle&quot; (Mad Nanterre) or &quot;Nanterre la rouge&quot; (Red Nanterre, in reference to communism). To this day, the university remains traditionally a center of the left wing, as opposed to universities such as [[University of Paris II: Panthéon-Assas|Paris II-Assas]], traditionally inclined to the right.

== Size and scope ==
Nanterre is the second largest campus in France after [[Nantes]], with its own Olympic-sized swimming pool and a stadium. It welcomes 35 to 40,000 students every year in all fields of studies: [[Social Sciences]], [[Philosophy]], [[Literature]], [[History]], Languages and [[Linguistics]], [[Economics]], [[Law]] and [[Political Sciences]], as well as Teacher Training, [[Acting]], [[Film|Cinema]], [[Physiology]] and [[Sports]].

The university is renowned in the fields of Law and Economics. Even though French universities are required by law to admit anyone with a [[Baccalauréat]], strain is put on the students from the start and the first year drop-out rate consistently hovers in the 60% region. At postgraduate level, the university offers very competitive programs (highly selective Masters in Law and Business) and partnerships with some [[grandes écoles]] such as the [[Ecole Polytechnique]], [[ESSEC]], [[Ecole des Mines]] de Paris, [[ESCP Europe]] ...

The Rene Ginouves Institute for Archaeology and Anthropology (Maison de l'archeologie et de l'ethnologie Rene Ginouves) is another important institution on campus, merging the departments of the [[CNRS]], [[University of Paris I: Panthéon-Sorbonne|Paris I-Panthéon Sorbonne]] and  Paris X-Nanterre.

As in most Parisian universities, there is a large minority of foreign exchange students.
[[Image:Lavie.gif|right|thumb|Paris X-Nanterre in May 68]]

== Innovative programs ==
Over the years, Nanterre has developed innovative programs such as the double bilingual courses in French Law and Anglo-American, Spanish, Russian, German or Italian law, in Economics &amp; Management (with half of the courses in French and half of the courses in another foreign language), in History (with half of the courses in French and half of the courses in another foreign language). These programs have inspired many universities and grandes écoles throughout the country and are now renowned on the national level.

{{Politics of France}}

The '''President of the French Republic''' ({{lang-fr|Président de la République française}}) colloquially referred to in English as the '''President of France''', is France's elected [[Head of State]].

Four of France's five republics have had presidents as their [[heads of state]], making the French presidency the oldest presidency in Europe still to exist in some form.
In each of the republics' constitutions, the president's powers, functions and duties, and their relation with French governments differed.

For details about the French system of government see [[Government of France]].

The president of France is also the [[ex officio]] [[List of Co-Princes of Andorra|Co-Prince]] of [[Andorra]], Grand Master of the [[Légion d'honneur]] and the [[Ordre national du Mérite]] and honorary proto-canon of the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]] in Rome.

The current President of the Republic is [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], since 6 May 2007.

==Current presidential powers==
The [[French Fifth Republic]] is a [[semi-presidential system]]. Unlike many other European presidents, the office of the French President is quite powerful. Although it is the [[Prime Minister of France]] and parliament that oversee much of the nation's actual lawmaking, the French President wields significant influence. The president holds the nation's most senior office, and outranks all other politicians.

===Summary===
The president's greatest power is their ability to choose the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]]. However, since only the [[French National Assembly]] has the power to dismiss the Prime Minister's government, the president is forced to name a prime minister who can command the support of a majority in the assembly.
*When the majority of the Assembly has opposite political views to that of the president, this leads to political ''[[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]]''. In that case, the president's power is diminished, since much of the de facto power relies on a supportive prime minister and National Assembly, and is not directly attributed to the post of president.
*When the majority of the Assembly sides with him, the President can take a more active role and may, in effect, direct government policy. The prime minister is then the personal choice of the President, and can be easily replaced if the administration becomes unpopular. This device has been used in recent years by both [[François Mitterrand]] and [[Jacques Chirac]].
Since 2002, the mandate of the president and the Assembly are both 5 years and the two elections are close to each other. Therefore, the likelihood of a &quot;cohabitation&quot; is lower. 
Among the powers of the government:
*The president [[promulgation|promulgate]]s laws.
**The president has a very limited form of suspensive [[veto]]: when presented with a law, he or she can request another reading of it by Parliament, but only once per law.
**The president may also refer the law for review to the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] prior to promulgation.
*The president may dissolve the [[French National Assembly]]
*The president may refer treaties or certain types of laws to popular [[referendum]], within certain conditions, among them the agreement of the Prime minister or the parliament.
*The president is the [[Commander-in-Chief]] (CINC) of the armies.
*The president may order the use of nuclear weapons.
*The president names the Prime minister but he cannot dismiss him. He names and dismisses the other ministers, with the agreement of the Prime minister.
*The president names most officials (with the assent of the cabinet).
*The president names certain members of the Constitutional Council.
*The president receives foreign ambassadors.
*The president may grant a [[pardon]] (but not an [[amnesty]]) to convicted criminals; the president can also lessen or suppress criminal sentences. This was of crucial importance when France still operated the death penalty: criminals sentenced to death would generally request that the president commute their sentence to [[life imprisonment]].

All decisions of the president must be countersigned by the Prime minister, except dissolving the [[French National Assembly]].

===Detailed constitutional powers===
The [[constitutional]] attributions of the president are defined in Title II of the [[Constitution of France]].

'''Article 5'''
The President of the Republic shall see that the Constitution is observed. He shall ensure, by his arbitration, the proper functioning of the public authorities and the continuity of the State.
He shall be the guarantor of national independence, territorial integrity and observance of treaties.

'''Article 8'''
The President of the Republic shall appoint the Prime Minister. He shall terminate the appointment of the Prime Minister when the latter tenders the resignation of the Government.
On the proposal of the Prime Minister, he shall appoint the other members of the Government and terminate their appointments.

'''Article 9'''
The President of the Republic shall preside over the Council of Ministers.

'''Article 10'''
The President of the Republic shall promulgate Acts of Parliament within fifteen days following the final adoption of an Act and its transmission to the Government.
He may, before the expiry of this time limit, ask Parliament to reconsider the Act or sections of the Act. Reconsideration shall not be refused.

''While the president has to sign all acts adopted by parliament into law, he cannot refuse to do so and exercise a kind of right of [[veto]]; his only power in that matter is to ask for a single reconsideration of the law by parliament and this power is subject to countersigning by the Prime minister.''

'''Article 11''' The president may submit laws to the citizens in a referendum with advice and consent of the cabinet.

'''Article 12'''
The President of the Republic may, after consulting the Prime Minister and the Presidents of the assemblies, declare the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] dissolved.
A general election shall take place not less than twenty days and not more than forty days after the dissolution.
The National Assembly shall convene as of right on the second Thursday following its election. Should it so convene outside the period prescribed for the ordinary session, a session shall be called by right for a fifteen-day period.
No further dissolution shall take place within a year following this election.

'''Article 13'''
The President of the Republic shall sign the [[ordonnance (French constitutional law)|ordinance]]s and [[decree#France|decree]]s deliberated upon in the Council of Ministers.
He shall make appointments to the civil and military posts of the State. [...]

'''Article 14'''
The President of the Republic shall accredit [[Ambassador (diplomacy)|ambassador]]s and envoys extraordinary to foreign powers ; foreign ambassadors and envoys extraordinary shall be accredited to him.

'''Article 15'''
The President of the Republic shall be commander-in-chief of the [[Military of France|armed forces]]. He shall preside over the higher national defence councils and committees.

'''Article 16'''
Where the institutions of the Republic, the independence of the Nation, the integrity of its territory or the fulfilment of its international commitments are under serious and immediate threat, and where the proper functioning of the constitutional public authorities is interrupted, the President of the Republic shall take the measures required by these circumstances, after formally consulting the Prime Minister, the Presidents of the assemblies and the Constitutional Council.
He shall inform the Nation of these measures in a message.
The measures must stem from the desire to provide the constitutional public authorities, in the shortest possible time, with the means to carry out their duties. The [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] shall be consulted with regard to such measures. Parliament shall convene as of right.
The [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]] shall not be dissolved during the exercise of the emergency powers.

''Article 16, allowing the president a limited form of [[rule by decree]] for a limited period of time in exceptional circumstance, has been used only once, by [[Charles de Gaulle]] during the [[Algerian War]], from 23 April to 29 September 1961.''

'''Article 17'''
The President of the Republic has the right to grant [[pardon]].

'''Article 18'''
The President of the Republic shall communicate with the two assemblies of Parliament by means of messages, which he shall cause to be read and which shall not be the occasion for any debate. He can also give an address in front of the [[Congress of France]] in Versailles.
Outside sessions, Parliament shall be convened especially for this purpose.

''From 1875 to 2008, the President was prohibited from entering the houses of Parliament.''

'''Article 19'''
Acts of the President of the Republic, other than those provided for under articles 8 (first paragraph), 11, 12, 16, 18, 54, 56 and 61, shall be countersigned by the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] and, where required, by the appropriate ministers.

'''Article 49 Para 3''' allows the president to adopt a law on his authority. To this end, the prime minister goes before the lower and upper houses, reads out the bill to the legislators and closes with &quot;the administration engages its responsibility&quot; on the foregoing. Deprived of Gaullist party support halfway into his seven-year term spanning 1974 to 1981, Pres. Valéry Giscard d'Estaing relied heavily on this provision to stalemate Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac's attempt to bring him back under Gaullist control.

===Presidential amnesties===
There is a tradition of so-called &quot;presidential [[amnesty|amnesties]]&quot;, which are something of a misnomer: after the election of a president, and of a [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]] of the same party, parliament traditionally votes a law granting amnesty for some petty crimes. This practice has been increasingly criticized, particularly because it is believed to incite people to commit traffic offences in the months preceding the election. Such an amnesty law may also authorize the president to designate individuals who have committed certain categories of crimes to be offered amnesty, if certain conditions are met. Such individual measures have been criticized for the political [[patronage]] that they allow. Still, it is argued that such amnesty laws help reduce prison overpopulation. An amnesty law was passed in 2002; none have yet been passed as of January 2008.

The difference between an amnesty and a presidential pardon is that the former clears all subsequent effects of the sentencing, as though the crime had not been committed, while pardon simply relieves the sentenced individual from part or all of the remainder of the sentence.

==Criminal responsibility and impeachment==
Articles 67 and 68 organize the regime of criminal responsibility of the President. They were reformed by a 2007 constitutional act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000245803 |title=Loi constitutionnelle n° 2007-238 du 23 février 2007 portant modification du titre IX de la Constitution |language=French |publisher=Legifrance.gouv.fr |date= |accessdate=2011-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to clarify a situation that previously resulted in legal controversies.&lt;ref&gt;For all this section, see Articles 67 and 68 and ''[http://www.cairn.info/revue-francaise-de-droit-constitutionnel-2002-1.htm La responsabilité pénale du président de la République]'', Revue française de droit constitutionnel, n° 49 –2002/1, [[P.U.F.]], ISBN 9782130527893&lt;/ref&gt;

The President of the Republic enjoys [[Sovereign immunity|immunity]] during his term: he cannot be requested to testify before any jurisdiction, he cannot be prosecuted, etc. However, the [[statute of limitation]] is suspended during his term, and enquiries and prosecutions can be restarted, at the latest one month after he leaves office.

The President is [[irresponsibility|irresponsible]] for his actions in his official capacity, except for prosecution before the [[International Criminal Court]] and impeachment. [[Impeachment]] can be pronounced by the High Court, a special court convened from both houses of Parliament on the proposal of either House, should the president have failed to discharge his duties in a way that evidently precludes the continuation of his term.

==Election==
{{See|Elections in France}}

Since [[French presidential election referendum, 1962|a 1962 referendum]], the President of France has been directly elected by [[universal suffrage]]; it was previously elected by an [[electoral college]].
Following [[Referendum on the reduction of the mandate of the President of the French Republic, 2000|a 2000 referendum]], the length of the term was reduced from 7 to 5 years; the first election to a shorter term was held in 2002. President Chirac was first elected in 1995 and again in 2002. There was no term limit, so Chirac could have run again, but chose not to. He was succeeded by [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] on 16 May 2007.
Since the [[French constitutional law of 23 July 2008|constitutional law of 23 July 2008]], a president cannot serve more than two consecutive terms. [[François Mitterrand]] and [[Jacques Chirac]] are the only Presidents to date who have served a full two terms (14 years for the former, 12 years for the latter).

In order to be admitted as an official candidate, potential candidates must receive signed presentations (informally known as ''parrainages'', for &quot;godfathering&quot;) from more than 500 elected officials, mostly mayors. These officials must be from at least 30 ''[[département]]s'' or overseas collectivities, and no more than 10% of them should be from the same ''département'' or collectivity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/texteconsolide/PPEAG.htm Law 62-1292 of 6 November 1962], article 4&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, each official may present only one candidate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/texteconsolide/MEHFY.htm Decree 2001-213 of 8 November 2001], article 6&lt;/ref&gt;

There are approximately 45,000 elected officials that are on the list of such officials, including around 36,000 mayors.

Spending and financing of campaigns and political parties are highly regulated. There is a cap on spending, at approximately 20&amp;nbsp;million euros, and government public financing of 50% of spending if the candidate scores more than 5%. If the candidate receives less than 5% of the vote, the government funds €800,000 to the party (€150,000 paid in advance)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metrofrance.com/fr/article/afp/2007/04/24/070424142028_h2o7rf6h/index.xml Dépenses de campagne: énorme ardoise pour LO, la LCR s'en tire sans déficit], ''[[Metro International|Metro France]]'', 24 April 2007 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising on TV is forbidden but official time is given to candidates on public TV. An independent agency regulates election and party financing.

French presidential elections are conducted via [[Two-round system|run-off voting]] which ensures that the elected President always obtains a majority: if no candidate receives a majority of votes in the first round of voting, the two highest-scoring candidates arrive at a run-off. After the president is elected, he goes through a solemn [[investiture]] ceremony called a &quot;''passation des pouvoirs''&quot; (&quot;handing over of powers&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elysee.fr/junior/faq/faq.htm#5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Succession and incapacity==
Upon the death or resignation of the President, the President of the [[French Senate|Senate]] acts as interim president.&lt;ref&gt;The exact title is &quot;President of the Senate, exercising provisionally the functions of the President of the Republic&quot;; see how Alain Poher is referred to on signing statutes into law, e.g. [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jopdf/common/jo_pdf.jsp?numJO=0&amp;dateJO=19690510&amp;numTexte=&amp;pageDebut=04675&amp;pageFin= law 69-412]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alain Poher]] is the only person to have served this temporary position. The first time was in 1969 after [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s resignation and a second time in 1974 after [[Georges Pompidou]]'s death. It is important to note that, in this situation, the President of the Senate became an Interim President of the Republic; they do not become the new President of the Republic as elected and therefore do not have to resign from their position as President of the Senate. In spite of his title as Interim President of the Republic, Poher is regarded in France as a former President and is listed in the presidents' gallery on elysee.fr (the President's official site). This is in contrast to acting presidents from the Third Republic.

The first round of a new presidential election must be organized no sooner than twenty days and no later than thirty-five days following the vacancy of the presidency. Because fifteen days can separate the first and second rounds of a presidential election, this means that the President of the Senate can only act as President of the Republic for a maximum period of fifty days. During this period of Interim president is not allowed to dismiss the national assembly nor are they allowed to call for a referendum or initiate any constitutional changes.

If there is no acting president of the senate, the powers of the president of the republic are exercised by the &quot;Gouvernement&quot;, meaning the Cabinet. This has been interpreted by some constitutional academics as meaning first the Prime Minister and, if he is himself not able to act, the members of the cabinet in the order of the list of the decree that nominated them. This is in fact unlikely to happen, because if the president of the Senate is not able to act, the Senate will normally name a new president of the Senate, that will act as President of the Republic.

During the [[Third French Republic]] the President of the Council of Ministers acted as President whenever office was vacant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mjp.univ-perp.fr/france/co1875.htm#pp Loi du 25 février 1875 relative à l'organisation des pouvoirs publics], article 7: In case of a vacancy due to a decease or for any cause, the two houses of Parliament elect a new president. In the meantime, the executive power is vested in the council of ministers.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to article 7 of the Constitution, if the presidency becomes vacant for any reason, or if the president becomes incapacitated, upon the request of the ''gouvernement'', the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] may rule, by a majority vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006529987&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069199 Ordonnance n°58-1067 du 7 novembre 1958] portant loi organique sur le Conseil constitutionnel&lt;/ref&gt; that the presidency is to be temporarily assumed by the President of the Senate. If the Council rules that the incapacity is permanent, the same procedure as for the resignation is applied, as described above.

If the President cannot attend meetings, including meetings of the Council of Ministers, he can ask the Prime Minister to attend in his stead (Constitution, article 21). This clause has been applied by presidents travelling abroad, ill, or undergoing surgery.

==Pay and official residences==
The President of the Republic is paid a salary according to a pay grade defined in comparison to the pay grades of the most seniors members of the [[French Civil Service]] (&quot;out of scale&quot;, ''hors échelle'', those whose pay grades are known as letters and not as numeric indices). In addition he is paid a residence stipend of 3%, and a function stipend of 25% on top of the salary and residence indemnity. This gross salary and these indemnities are the same as those of the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]], and are 50% higher than the highest paid to other members of the government,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000774848&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000017924333&amp;dateTexte=20090729 Loi n°2002-1050 du 6 août 2002 de Finances rectificative pour 2002], as amended&lt;/ref&gt; which is itself defined as twice the average of the highest (pay grade G) and the lowest (pay grade A1) salaries in the &quot;out of scale&quot; pay grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006213505&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000005633245&amp;dateTexte=20090729 |title=Décret n°2002-1058 du 6 août 2002 relatif au traitement des membres du Gouvernement, art. 1 |language=French |publisher=Legifrance.gouv.fr |date=2002-08-06 |accessdate=2011-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the 2008 &quot;out of scale&quot; pay grades&lt;ref&gt;[http://costkiller.net/salaires/salaires-fonction-publique.htm Grille de salaires de la fonction publique],&lt;/ref&gt; this amounts to a monthly pay of €20,963, which fits the €19,000 quoted to the press in early 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politique.net/2008022801-le-salaire-du-premier-ministre-a-double-depuis-2002.htm Le salaire du Premier ministre a doublé depuis 2002], citing an interview given by [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] to ''[[Le Parisien]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Using the pay grades starting from 1 July 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000020815910 Décret n° 2009-824] du 3 juillet 2009 portant majoration à compter du 1er juillet 2009 de la rémunération des personnels civils et militaires de l'Etat, des personnels des collectivités territoriales et des établissements publics d'hospitalisation et portant attribution de points d'indice majoré&lt;/ref&gt; this amounts to a gross monthly pay of €21,131.

The salary and the residence stipend are taxable for [[income tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069577&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000018620290&amp;dateTexte=20090729 |title=General tax code, art. 80 undecies A |language=French|publisher=Legifrance.gouv.fr |date= |accessdate=2011-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official residence and office of the president is the [[Élysée Palace]] in Paris. Other presidential residences include:
*the ''[[Fort de Brégançon]]'', in southeastern France, is the current official presidential vacationing residence;
*the ''[[Hôtel de Marigny]]''; standing next to the Élysée Palace, houses foreign official guests;
*the ''[[Château de Rambouillet]]'' is normally open to visitors when not used for (rare) official meetings;
*the ''Domaine National de [[Château de Marly|Marly]]'' is normally open to visitors when not used for (rare) official meetings;
*the ''Domaine de Souzy-la-Briche'', not a historical monument, is a private residence.

==Former Presidents==
{{See|List of Presidents of France}}
As of 2011 there were two living former Presidents:
*[[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] (served 1974–1981)
*[[Jacques Chirac]] (served 1995–2007)

According to French law, Former Presidents have guaranteed lifetime pension defined according to the pay grade of the [[Council of State (France)|Councillors of State]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006272630 Loi n°55–366 du 3 avril 1955] relative au développement des crédits affectés aux dépenses du ministère des finances et des affaires économiques pour l'exercice 1955&lt;/ref&gt; a courtesy diplomatic passport,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000020278243 Arrêté du 11 février 2009 relatif au passeport diplomatique], article 1&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to the French Constitution (Article 56), membership of the Constitutional Council.

They also get personnel, an apartment and/or office, and other amenities, though the legal basis for these is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;The current system for providing personnel and other amenities to the former French presidents was devised in 1981 by [[Michel Charasse]], then advisor to president [[François Mitterrand]], in order to care for former president [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] and the widow of former president [[Georges Pompidou]]. See [[French Senate|Senate]], [http://www.senat.fr/seances/s200806/s20080619/s20080619005.html 19 June 2008 Proceedings]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, according to an answer by the services of the Prime Minister to a question from member of the National Assembly [[René Dosière]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://questions.assemblee-nationale.fr/q13/13-140QE.htm Question #140], answer published in the [[Journal Officiel de la République Française]] on 24 June 2008 page: 5368&lt;/ref&gt; these facilities comprised: a security detail, a car with a [[chauffeur]], office or housing space, maintained by the State. Two people service this space. In addition, the State funds 7 permanent collaborators.

==Presidential spouse==
{{See|Wife of the President of the French Republic}}
There is no official status or title such as '[[First Lady]]' for the spouse of the President under the French constitution. Charity work has traditionally been the main task of French presidential spouses under the Third, Fourth and Fifth Republics.

==History==
Under the [[French Third Republic|Third]] and [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]], which were [[parliamentary system]]s, the office of President of the Republic was a largely ceremonial and powerless one.

The constitution of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] greatly increased the President's powers. A [[French presidential election referendum, 1962|1962 referendum]] changed the constitution, so that the President would be directly elected by universal suffrage and not by the Parliament.

In 2000, a [[French constitutional referendum, 2000|referendum]] shortened the presidential term from seven years to five years.

A maximum of two consecutive terms was imposed after the [[French constitutional law of 23 July 2008|2008 constitutional reform]].

The '''Rally for the Republic''' ({{lang-fr|Rassemblement pour la République}}, '''RPR'''), was a French right-wing [[political party]]. Originating from the [[Union of Democrats for the Republic]] (''Union des Démocrates pour la République'', UDR), it was founded by [[Jacques Chirac]] in 1976 and presented itself as the heir of [[Gaullism]]. On 21 September 2002, the RPR was merged into the Union for the Presidential Majority (''Union pour la majorité présidentielle''), later renamed the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (''Union pour un mouvement populaire'', '''UMP''').

==History==
===The defense of the Gaullist identity against President Giscard d'Estaing (1976–1981)===

In 1974, the divisions in the Gaullist movement permitted the election of [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] to the Presidency of the French Republic. Representing the pro-European and [[Orleanist]] centre-right, he was the first non-Gaullist rising to the head of the state since the beginning of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] in 1958. However, the Gaullist Party remained the main force in parliament and [[Jacques Chirac]] was appointed Prime Minister. Chirac resigned in August 1976 and in December 1976 the RPR was created in order to restore the Gaullist domination over the republican institutions.

Though retaining its support for the president's government, the RPR criticized the executive duo composed of President Giscard d'Estaing and Prime Minister [[Raymond Barre]]. Its first master stroke was in March 1977 the election of Chirac as Mayor of Paris against [[Michel d'Ornano]], a close friend of President Giscard d'Estaing. Nevertheless, it was faced with the creation of the [[Union for French Democracy]] (UDF), a confederation of the parties supporting the presidential policies and which competed for the leadership over the right. Consequently, the stake of the [[French legislative election, 1978|1978 legislative election]] was not only the victory of the right over the left, but the domination of the RPR over the UDF in the parliamentary majority.

Given the increasing unpopularity of the executive duo, and with a view to the next presidential election, the RPR became more and more critical. In December 1978, six months before the European Parliament election, the ''Call of Cochin'' signed by Chirac denounced the appropriation of France by &quot;the foreign party,&quot; which sacrificed the national interests and the independence of the country in order to build a federal Europe. This accusation clearly targeted Giscard d'Estaing. RPR leaders contrasted this as coming from the social doctrine of Gaullism as opposed to a perceived liberalism on the part of the President.

As RPR candidate at the [[French presidential election, 1981|1981 presidential election]], Chirac formulated vigorous condemnations of President [[Giscard d'Estaing]], who ran for a second term. Eliminated in the first round, Chirac refused to give an endorsement for the second round, though he did say privately that he would vote for Giscard d'Estaing. In fact, the RPR was expected to work for the defeat of the incumbent president.

[[Image:RPR old logo.png|thumb|left|The first logo of the RPR recalls the Gaullist inheritance with the [[Cross of Lorraine]], symbol of the [[Free French]], drawn on top of the [[phrygian cap]] (normally worn by [[Marianne]]).]]

===The opposition to President Mitterrand and the abandonment of the Gaullist doctrine (1981–1995)===
After 1981, the RPR opposed with energy the policy of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] President [[François Mitterrand]] and the left-wing governments. The RPR denounced the plan of [[nationalization]]s as the setting up of a &quot;collectivist society&quot;. Impressed by the electoral success of [[New Right]] conservatives led by [[Ronald Reagan]] in the United States of America and by [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the United Kingdom, it gradually abandoned the Gaullist doctrine, claiming a less control of the state in economy. During its 1983 congress, it advocated a [[economic liberalism|liberal economic]] programme and the pursuit of the European construction, accepting the supranationality.

This new political line contributed to the reconciliation between the RPR and the UDF. In this, they presented a common list at the 1984 European Parliament election and a platform to prepare the winning [[French legislative election, 1986|1986 legislative election]]. However, a rivalry appeared between Jacques Chirac and Raymond Barre who competed for the right-wing leadership with a view to the next presidential election. Futhemore, if the right-wing coalition benefited from the failures of the Socialist power, it was confronted with the emergence of the [[National Front (France)|National Front]] in the far right. The RPR was divided about the possibility of alliance with this party.

In 1986, being the leader of the main party of the new parliamentary majority and accepting the principle of the &quot;[[Cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]]&quot; with President Mitterrand (contrary to Barre), Chirac became again Prime Minister. He led a liberal economic policy inspired by [[Anglosphere|Anglo-Saxon]] examples, selling a lot of public companies, abolishing the [[wealth tax]]. His Interior Minister [[Charles Pasqua]] led a policy of restriction of immigration. If Chirac acceded in the second round of the [[French presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]] despite Raymond Barre's candidacy, he was defeated by Mitterrand.

While the RPR returned in the opposition, the leadership of Chirac was challenged by younger politicians who wished to renew the right. Furthemore, the abandonment of the Gaullist doctrine was criticized by [[Charles Pasqua]] and [[Philippe Séguin]]. They tried to take him the RPR lead in 1990, in vain. However, the division re-appeared with the 1992 Maastricht referendum. Chirac voted &quot;yes&quot; whereas Séguin and Pasqua campaigned for &quot;no&quot;.

The &quot;[[Union for France]]&quot;, a RPR/UDF coalition, won the [[French legislative election, 1993|1993 legislative election]]. Chirac refused to re-cohabitate with Mitterrand, and [[Edouard Balladur]] became prime minister. Balladur promised that he would not be a candidate at the [[French presidential election, 1995|1995 presidential election]]. Nevertheless, polls indicated Balladur was the favorite in the presidential race and, furthermore, he was supported by the most part of the right-wing politicians. He decided finally to run against Chirac. However, they claimed that they remained friends for 30 years.

The Socialists being weakened after the 14 years of Mitterrand's presidency, the main competition was within the right, between Balladur and Chirac, two Neo-Gaullists. Balladur proposed a liberal program and took advantage of the &quot;positive results&quot; of his cabinet, whereas Chirac advocated [[Keynesian economics]] to reduce the &quot;social fracture&quot; and criticized the &quot;dominant ideas&quot;, targeting Balladur. Chirac won the [[French presidential election, 1995|1995 presidential election]].

===The RPR became the presidential party (1995–2002)===
After his election as [[President of France]], Jacques Chirac nominated [[Alain Juppé]], &quot;the best among us&quot; according to him, as Prime Minister. But the majority of the personalities who had supported Balladur during the presidential campaign were excluded from the government. The ''balladuriens'' (such as [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]) were completely isolated in the party too.

In November 1995, Prime Minister [[Alain Juppé]] announced a plan to reform the French [[welfare state]] which sparked wide social conflict. The executive duo became very unpopular and some months later President Chirac dissolved the National Assembly. His supporters lost the [[French legislative election, 1997|1997 legislative election]]. Consequently, he was forced to cohabitate with a left-wing cabinet led by [[Lionel Jospin]] until 2002.

Séguin succeeded to Juppé as RPR leader, but he criticized the ascendancy of President Chirac over the party. He resigned during the 1999 European campaign while Pasqua presented a dissident list to advocate the Gaullist idea of a &quot;Europe of nations&quot;. Pasqua founded the [[Rally for France]] (''Rassemblement pour la France'' or '''RPF''') and obtained more votes than the RPR official list led by [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]. [[Michèle Alliot-Marie]], former Minister of Youth and sports, was elected RPR leader, against the will of President Chirac who supported covertly an unfamous candidate [[Jean-Paul Delevoye]]. Besides, a lot of scandals appeared about the financing of the RPR. For instance, the party was suspected to pay its employees with the funds of Paris's municipality. The RPR lost the mayoralty of Paris in 2001, in aid of the left.

Before the [[French presidential election, 2002|2002 presidential election]], both RPR and non-RPR supporters of Chirac gathered in an association: the &quot;Union on the move&quot;. It became the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (''Union pour un mouvement populaire'' or '''UMP''') after the 21 April 2002 electoral shock. Chirac was re-elected and the new party won the [[French legislative election, 2002|legislative election]].

Prior to its replacement by the UMP, the RPR had been increasingly embroiled in judicial proceedings following from the [[corruption scandals in the Paris region]]. Its former secretary-general [[Alain Juppé]] was sentenced in 2004 for a related felony. In 2007, a formal judicial investigation was opened against Jacques Chirac himself.

The '''Union for a Popular Movement''' ({{lang-fr|Union pour un Mouvement Populaire}}, UMP) is a [[centre-right]]&lt;ref name=&quot;centreright&quot;/&gt; [[List of political parties in France|political party in France]], being one of the two [[major party|major]] contemporary political parties in the country along with the center-left [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (PS). The UMP was formed in 2002 as a merger of several centre-right parties under President [[Jacques Chirac]]. 

Its current leader [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] was elected [[President of France]] in 2007, and the party enjoys an [[absolute majority]] in the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]], while the plurality in the [[French Senate|Senate]] is held by the Socialists and their allies. [[Jean-François Copé]] is the party secretary-general. The UMP is a member of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP), the [[Centrist Democrat International]] (CDI) and the [[International Democrat Union]] (IDU).

==History==
===Background===
Since the 1980s, the political groups of the parliamentary right joined forces around the values of economic liberalism and the building of Europe. Their rivalries had contributed to their defeat in the [[French legislative election, 1981|1981]] and [[French legislative election, 1988|1988]] elections.

Before the [[French legislative election, 1993|1993 legislative election]], the Gaullist-conservative [[Rally for the Republic]] (RPR) and the centrist [[Union for French Democracy]] (UDF) formed an electoral alliance, the [[Union for France]]. However, at the [[French presidential election, 1995|1995 presidential campaign]] they were both divided between followers of [[Jacques Chirac]], who was eventually elected, and supporters of [[Edouard Balladur]]. After their defeat in the [[French legislative election, 1997|1997 legislative election]], RPR and UDF created the [[Alliance for France]] in order to coordinate the action of their parliamentary groups.

===Foundation and early years===
Before the [[French presidential election, 2002|2002 presidential campaign]], the supporters of President [[Jacques Chirac]] who were divided in three right-wing parliamentary parties founded an association named '''Union on the Move''' (''Union en mouvement'').&lt;ref name=&quot;ump-history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.france-politique.fr/histoire-ump.htm|publisher=France politique|title = chronologie UMP}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Chirac's re-election, in order to fight together the [[French legislative election, 2002|legislative election]], the '''Union for the Presidential Majority''' (''Union pour la majorité présidentielle'') was created. It was re-named &quot;Union for a Popular Movement&quot; some months later, establishing the UMP as a permanent organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;ump-history&quot;/&gt; 

The UMP was founded as a merger of the Gaullist-conservative [[Rally for the Republic]] (RPR), the conservative-liberal [[Liberal Democracy (France)|Liberal Democracy]] (DL), a sizeable portion of the centrist [[Union for French Democracy]] (UDF), more precisely the UDF's Christian Democrats (such as [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]] and [[Jacques Barrot]]), the social-liberal [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]] and the centrist [[Popular Party for French Democracy]] (both associate parties of the UDF until 2002). The UMP was thus the merger of four major French political families: [[Gaullism]], Liberalism (also known as ''Republicanism'' in France), [[Christian Democracy]] (''[[Popolarismo|Popularism]]'') and [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicalism]].

As indicated by its initial name, the UMP generally supported the policies of President Chirac. However, in 2004, the party showed increasing signs of independence. The unpopularity with the electorate of Jacques Chirac and [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]]'s government led most members of the UMP to support [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], a rival of Chirac. On the issues, the party under Sarkozy publicly disapproved of [[Turkey]]'s proposed membership in the European Union, which Chirac had previously endorsed several times publicly, and generally took a more right-wing position.

At the [[French regional elections, 2004|2004 regional elections]] the UMP suffered a heavy blow, winning the presidencies of only 2 out of 22 regions in metropolitan France ([[Alsace]] and [[Corsica]]) and only half of the departments (the right had previously won numerous departmental presidencies). At the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (France)|2004 European Parliament election]] in June the party also suffered a heavy blow, with only 16.6% of the vote, far behind the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]], and only 16 seats. This results remains the UMP's lowest point.

The first president of the UMP, [[Alain Juppé]], a close associate of Jacques Chirac, resigned on 15 July 2004 after being convicted of [[political corruption]] in January of the same year. On 29 November 2004, Nicolas Sarkozy announced that he would take over the presidency of the UMP and resign his position as [[Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industry (France)|finance minister]], ending months of speculation. The failure of the [[French European Constitution referendum, 2005|referendum on the European Constitution]] of 25 May 2005 led to the fall of the government of Jean-Pierre Raffarin and to the formation of a new cabinet, presided by another UMP politician, [[Dominique de Villepin]].

===Nicolas Sarkozy===
On 22 April 2007 [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] won the plurality of votes in the first round of the [[French presidential election, 2007|2007 presidential election]]. On 6 May he faced the Socialist candidate [[Ségolène Royal]] in the second round and won, garnering 53.1% of the vote. As a consequence, he resigned from the presidency of the UMP on 14 May 2007, two days before becoming President of the French Republic. [[François Fillon]] was appointed Prime Minister. On 17 June, at a [[French legislative election, 2007|legislative election]], the UMP gained a majority in the National Assembly with 313 out of 577 seats, though it was less than expected.

At the 2008 [[French municipal elections, 2008|municipal]] and [[French cantonal elections, 2008|cantonal]] elections the party suffered a big blow, losing numerous cities, such as [[Toulouse]] and [[Strasbourg]], as well as 8 departmental presidencies to the left. [[Xavier Bertrand]] was selected as secretary-general of the party in late 2008 to replace [[Patrick Devedjian]], who resigned to take up a cabinet position. At the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (France)|2009 European Parliament election]], the party ran a common &quot;Presidential Majority&quot; list with the smaller [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]] as well as [[New Centre]] and [[Modern Left]]. The UMP list won 27.9%, a remarkably good result for a governing party in off-year &quot;mid-term&quot; elections, and elected 29 MEPs, significantly improving on the UMP's poor result in the 2004 election – also an off-year election. However, in the [[French regional elections, 2010|2010 regional election]] the UMP obtained a very poor result with only 26.0% of votes, losing Corsica and retaining only Alsace.

In a cabinet reshuffle in November 2010, which disappointed centrists within and outside the UMP, François Fillon was confirmed Prime Minister and [[Alain Juppé]] re-joined the government after three years out of politics. Among those who quit the cabinet there were [[Bernard Kouchner]], [[Hervé Morin]] and, above all, [[Jean-Louis Borloo]]. Xavier Bertrand, who re-joined the government, was replaced as general-secretary of the UMP by [[Jean-François Copé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=lefigaro.fr |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2010/11/14/01002-20101114ARTFIG00213-remaniement-le-gouvernement-fillon-iii-ancre-a-droite-pour-2012.php |title=Le Figaro – Politique : Remaniement : le gouvernement Fillon III ancré à droite pour 2012 |work=Le Figaro |location=France |date= |accessdate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=lefigaro.fr |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2010/11/15/01002-20101115ARTFIG00554-borloo-et-morin-sonnent-la-revolte-des-centristes.php |title=Le Figaro – Politique : Borloo et Morin sonnent la révolte des centristes |work=Le Figaro |location=France |date=16 November 2010 |accessdate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, during a party congress, the Radical Party, led by Borloo, decided to leave the UMP and launch [[The Alliance (France)|The Alliance]], a new centrist coalition.&lt;ref&gt;http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualite/politique/20110514.OBS3117/le-parti-radical-vote-son-independance-vis-a-vis-de-l-ump.html/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.91secondes.fr/alliance-republicaine-ecologique-et-sociale-ares&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.germain-isern.com/2011/05/maurice-leroy-croit-en-une-grande.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.partiradical.net/images/stories/evenement/invitationlancementdelalliance.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular support==
The UMP's electoral base reflects that of the old [[Rally for the Republic]] and, in some cases, that of the [[Union for French Democracy]]. In the 2007 presidential election, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] performed best in the east of France – particularly [[Alsace]] (36.2%); [[Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur]] (37.0%) – the wealthy coastal [[Departments of France|department]] of the [[Alpes-Maritimes]] (43.6%) was his best department in France; [[Champagne-Ardenne]] (32.7%) and [[Rhône-Alpes]] (32.7%). These areas were among far-right candidate [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]'s best regions in 2002 and are conservative on issues such as immigration. Sarkozy obviously received a lot of votes from voters who had supported the far-right in April 2002. For example, in the [[Alpes-Maritimes]], Sarkozy performed 21.6% better than Chirac did in 2002 while Le Pen lost 12.6% in five years.&lt;ref name=&quot;ifop&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ifop.com/?option=com_publication&amp;type=publication&amp;id=31|title= IFOP analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarkozy also appealed more than average to [[blue-collar]] workers in regions such as northern [[Meurthe-et-Moselle]] and the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]], although most of these regions, despite his gains, remain reliably left-wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://cdsp.sciences-po.fr/AE.php|title= Results |publisher=CDSP website}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party is also strong in every election in very wealthy suburban or coastal (and, in some cases, urban) areas such as [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] (72.6% for Sarkozy in the first round),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/PR2007/053/035/5335.html|title= Ministry of the Interior results page}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint-Tropez]] (54.79%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/PR2007/093/083/83119.html|title= Ministry of the Interior results page}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cannes]] (48.19%)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/PR2007/093/006/06029.html|title= Ministry of the Interior results page}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Marcq-en-Barœul]] (47.35%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/PR2007/031/059/59378.html|title= Ministry of the Interior results page}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is strong in most rural areas, like most conservative parties in the world, but this does not extend to the rural areas of the south of France, areas which are old strongholds of [[republicanism|republican]] and secular ideals. However, in old &quot;clerical&quot; Catholic rural areas, such as parts of [[Lozère]] or [[Cantal]], it is very strong, as was the [[Union for French Democracy]] (UDF) in its hey day.

However, the UMP does poorly in one of the UDF's best regions, [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]], where the decline of religious practice, a moderate electorate and urbanization has hurt the UMP and also the UDF. Nicolas Sarkozy performed relatively poorly in departments with a large share of moderate Christian democratic (often centrist or centre-right) voters, such as [[Lozère]] where the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] candidate [[Ségolène Royal]] performed better (44.3%) than [[François Mitterrand]] had in his 1988 left-wing landslide (43.1%). While former President [[Jacques Chirac]], the right's strongman in normally left-wing [[Corrèze]] had always done very well in Corrèze and the surrounding departments, Sarkozy did much poorly and actually lost the department in the 2007 runoff. However, in the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (France)|2009 European election]], the UMP's results in those departments were superior to Sarkozy's first round result (nationally, they were 4% lower).&lt;ref name=&quot;ifop&quot; /&gt;

===Presidents===
*[[Alain Juppé]] (2002–2004)
*[[Nicolas Sarkozy]] (2004–2007)
*collegial leadership (2007–present)

When Nicolas Sarkozy became [[President of France]] in 2007, the office of president of the party was replaced by a collegial leadership composed of the secretary-general and the vice presidents of the party. In July 2007 Jean-Claude Gaudin, the party's acting president, explained that &quot;Nicolas Sarkozy remains, morally, president of the UMP&quot; and the party endorsed this statement by not choosing a successor to Sarkozy. As the post of president of the UMP is, for the moment, abolished, the secretary-general is the ''de facto'' leader of the UMP.

'''Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba''' ({{IPA-es|alˈfɾeðo ˈpeɾeθ ruβalˈkaβa}}; born 28 July 1951) is a Spanish politician who is Secretary General of the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) and leader of the opposition in the Spanish Parliament. He served in the government of Spain as Minister of Education from 1992 to 1993 and as Minister of the Interior from 2006 to 2011; in addition, he was First Deputy Prime Minister from 2010 to 2011.

He was born in [[Solares]] village, municipality of [[Medio Cudeyo]], in [[Cantabria]] region. He obtained a [[doctorate]] in chemistry at [[Complutense University]] in [[Madrid]], where he went on to become a professor of chemistry, specialising in reaction mechanisms in [[organic chemistry]]. He represented [[Toledo (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Toledo]] in Congress from 1993 to 1996, [[Madrid (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Madrid]] from 1996 until 2004, [[Cantabria (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Cantabria]] from 2004 to 2008 and, despite not being [[Andalusian people|Andalusian]], was put forward for the [[safe seat|safe parliamentary seat]] of [[Cádiz (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Cádiz]] in the 2008 election, which he won. 

Rubalcaba was appointed Minister of Education and Science in 1992 by President [[Felipe González]]. The following year he was made Minister of the President's office and Relationships with Congress, an office he had to abandon in 1996 when his party lost the elections. In the successful campaign of 2004 he worked as chief strategist. When [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] formed the new government, Rubalcaba was appointed Majority leader until 2006 when he succeeded [[José Antonio Alonso]] as Interior Minister. On October 2010 he added to his functions the position of First Deputy Prime Minister and Spokesperson of the government. As it became assumed that President Zapatero was not going to seek reelection he became favorite to succeed him with [[Carme Chacón]] as his only rival in the primaries. Nevertheless, in May 2011, Chacón announced that she was withdrawing from the race and in June the Party announced that no other candidate had filed and Rubalcaba became the PSOE's Prime Ministerial candidate for the [[Spanish general election, 2011|2011 general elections]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/18530051?story_id=18530051 Exit plan:The Socialists contemplate who would be their best new leader] The Economist 7 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 July 2011, he resigned from his duties in the government in order to focus on the [[Spanish general election, 2011|general election campaign]], which he lost getting the worst results in PSOE's history.

He filed to succeed José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero as PSOE's General Secretary and won the vote, held in February 2012. He received 487 votes against 465 for Carme Chacón.&lt;ref&gt;elperiodicodeaqui.com http://www.elperiodicodeaqui.com/noticia/alfredo-perez-rubalcaba-gana-carme-chacon-por-22-votos-diferencia/15251&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Spanish '''Congress of Deputies''' ({{lang-es|Congreso de los Diputados|links=no}}) is the lower house of the [[Cortes Generales]], Spain's [[legislative branch]]. It has 350 members, elected by popular vote on block lists by [[proportional representation]] in [[constituency|constituencies]] matching the Spanish [[Provinces of Spain|province]]s using the [[D'Hondt method]]. Deputies serve four-year terms. The ''[[President of the Congress of Deputies]]'' is the analogue to a Speaker and presides over debates in Spain's lower chamber of parliament.

In the Congress, members of the Parliament from the political parties, or groups of parties, form parliamentary groups. Groups must be formed by, at least, 15 MPs, but a group can also be formed with only five MPs if the parties in it got, at least, 5% of the nationwide vote, or 15% of the votes in the constituencies they run for seats.

The MPs belonging to parties who can't create their own parliamentary group shall form the Mixed Group.&lt;ref&gt;`[http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/GruPar/InfoGruPar Information about Parliamentary Groups] - Congress of Deputies of Spain&lt;/ref&gt; The composition of the 10th term Congress is:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/GruPar Parliamentary Groups] - Congress of Deputies of Spain&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francoist Spain''' refers to a period of [[history of Spain|Spanish history]] between 1936 and 1975 when [[Spain]] was under the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[dictatorship]] of [[Francisco Franco]]. 

The regime was formed on 1 October 1936{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} by Francisco Franco and the National Defense Committee (a faction of the Spanish army rebelling against the Republic). The regime was entrenched upon the victory in the [[Spanish Civil War]], which the regime called the ''Guerra de Liberación Nacional'', of the rebel ''Nacionales'' coalition. Besides the internal support, Franco's rebellion had been backed from abroad by [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]], while the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was  backed by the Stalinist [[Soviet Union]]. 

At the end of the  Spanish Civil War, according to the calculations of the regime, there were more than 270,000 men and women held in the regime's prisons and some 500,000 fled into exile. Large numbers of those captured were returned to Spain or interned in Nazi concentration camps as ''stateless enemies''. Between six and seven thousand exiles from Spain died in [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]].  It has been estimated that more than 200,000 Spaniards died in the first years of the dictatorship, from 1940–42, as a result of political repression, hunger and disease related to the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;The Splintering of Spain, p2-3 ISBN , Cambridge University Press, 9-780521-821780&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Nacionales''  established a [[single-party state|single party]] authoritarian state under the undisputed leadership of Franco. Though Spain was officially neutral through World War Two, it did send a special Division of troops to Russia to aid the Germans, and its pro-Axis stance led to it being isolated after the collapse of the Axis powers. This changed with the new [[Cold War]] that quickly followed the end of hostilities in 1945, in the face of which Franco's strong [[anti-communism]] naturally tilted its régime to ally with the [[United States]], and provided ideal ground for the continuation of Franco's anti-communist regime. Independent political parties and trade unions were banned throughout the duration of the dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;The Splintering of Spain,  Cambridge University Press, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

A decree of Economic Stabilisation was introduced in 1959, opening the way for massive foreign investment - &quot; a watershed in post-war economic, social and ideological ''normalisation'' leading to extraordinarily rapid economic growth&quot;, that marked Spain's &quot;participation in the Europe-wide post-war economic normality centred on mass consumption and consensus, in contrast to the concurrent reality of the Soviet bloc.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The Splintering of Spain, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; Official discourse on the Civil War had shifted also in this time, from the ''crusade'' for the nation against a foreign invasion, an anti-Spain, towards a more conciliatory construction of the conflict as a fratricidal war, the mutual killing of brothers.

Spain was declared a [[monarchy|kingdom]] in 1947, but no monarch was designated. Franco reserved for himself the right to name the person to be king, and deliberately delayed the selection due to political considerations. The selection finally came in 1969, with the designation of [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos de Borbón]] as Franco's official successor.

With the death of Franco on 20 November 1975, Juan Carlos became the [[King of Spain]]. He immediately began the process of a [[Spanish transition to democracy|transition to democracy]], ending with Spain becoming a [[constitutional monarchy]] articulated by a [[parliamentary democracy]].

==Etymology and usage==
The formal name of Spain during the Franco era was the '''Spanish State''' ({{lang|es|''Estado Español''}}). In 1947, the state was formally proclaimed to be a monarchy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Shneidman |first=Jerome Lee |title=Spain &amp; Franco, 1949-59 |publisher= Facts on File, Inc |year=1973 |page=32 |isbn=0871961806}}&lt;/ref&gt; but international treaties continued after that date to refer to it as the ''Spanish State'' rather than as the ''Kingdom of Spain''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%202331/v2331.pdf United Nations, treaties], volume 2331&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20536/v536.pdf United Nations, treaties], volume 536&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Spanish Civil War broke out, the Nationalist forces immediately began using the form the ''Spanish State'' rather than the ''[[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]]'' or the ''Kingdom of Spain'', out of deference to the differing political sensibilities of the members of the Nationalist coalition, which included, amongst others, the anti-monarchic fascist [[Falangist]]s, and the rival conservative-monarchist [[Carlism|Carlist]]s and Legitimist parties.

Following the Second World War, both the Falangist and Carlist movements declined, while Franco's rule was consolidated. This allowed Franco to nominally restore the Spanish monarchy without any significant opposition.

==History==
{{History of Spain}}

===Establishment===
The Nationalist senior generals held an informal meeting in September 1936, where they elected [[Francisco Franco]] as leader of the Nationalists, with the rank of ''[[Generalissimo|Generalísimo]]'' (sometimes written in English as ''Generalissimo'', after the [[Fascist Italian]] fashion).  He was originally supposed to be only commander-in-chief, but after the death of [[Emilio Mola|General Emilio Mola]] (the initial leader of the movement) became head of state as well with nearly unlimited and absolute powers.

This provisional government ruled over the territories controlled by the Nationalists during the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]]. Its main political action during the war was the consolidation of the heterogeneous political forces that joined the rebellion into a [[single party]], the authoritarian [[Falange]].&lt;ref&gt;In full, the ''Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, the Nationalist government repressed Republican militants and sympathizers, as retaliation for the repression of clergy and Nationalist militants on the opposite side. Extrajudicial killings were widespread on both sides during the whole war. The retaliation continued right after the war, in part to punish war crimes committed under the Republican government, under a trial called ''Causa General''. Franco's government executed, jailed, or subjected to forced labor thousands of Republicans, but many of them were entirely innocent of anything other than the flimsiest support for the Republican cause, or merely being related to known Republicans. As a result thousands chose to go into exile, mostly in France and Mexico. Of those who fled to metropolitan France, many joined the [[French resistance]] against the Nazis. One such exile in metropolitan France was [[Lluís Companys]], President of the [[Generalitat de Catalunya|Catalan Government]]; he was subsequently arrested and extradited to Spain in September 1940 by [[Vichy France|the Pétain regime]], then executed after a military trial.

Many of those who had supported the Republic fled into exile. Spain lost thousands of doctors, nurses, teachers, lawyers, judges, professors, businessmen, artists, etc.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Many of those who had to stay lost their jobs or lost their rank. Sometimes those jobs were given to unskilled and even untrained personnel. This deprived the country of many of its brightest minds, and also of a very capable workforce. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}. However, this was done to keep Spain's citizens consistent with the ideals sought by the FET y de las JONS and Franco.

===World War II years (1939–1945)===
{{Main|Spain in World War II}}

In September 1939, [[World War II]] broke out in Europe. After the collapse of France in June 1940, Spain adopted a pro-Axis non-belligerency stance (for example, it offered Spanish naval facilities to German ships), and returned escaping Allied servicemen and fleeing resistance fighters to the Nazis, returning the favour paid by the Nazis when they had contributed forces including the Stuka dive bombers to support Franco and the Nationalists during the Civil War.

[[Adolf Hitler]] met Franco in [[Hendaye]], France (23 October 1940), to discuss the Spanish entry in the war joining the [[Axis Powers|Axis]]. Franco's demands (food, military equipment, [[Gibraltar]], [[French North Africa]], etc.) proved too much and no agreement was reached.

Contributing to the disagreement was an ongoing dispute over German mining rights in Spain. Some historians argue that Franco made demands that he knew Hitler would not accede to in order to stay out of the war. Other historians argue that he simply had nothing to offer the Germans. Franco did send volunteer troops to fight communism joining the Axis armies on the [[Eastern Front (WWII)|Eastern Front]] against the [[Soviet Union]]. The unit name was the [[División Azul]], or Blue Division, after the [[Falange]]'s party color, whose members were known as 'blueshirts'.  Franco returned to complete neutrality in 1943, when the tide of the war had turned decisively against Germany. However, [[Fulgencio Batista]] of [[Cuba]], despite the Cuban armed forces not being greatly involved in World War II, had suggested a joint [[United States|U.S.]]-[[Latin America]]n assault on Spain in order to overthrow the Franco regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,802544,00.html &quot;Batista's Boost&quot;], ''Time'', {{Nowrap|January 18}}, 1943. Retrieved {{Nowrap|March 2}}, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isolation (1945–1953)===
After the war, the Allies used Spain's ties to the Axis powers to keep it from joining the [[United Nations]]. Franco's government was seen, especially by Soviet countries but also by the Western allies, to be a remnant of the central European fascist regimes.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Under these circumstances, a UN resolution condemning Franco's government followed. The resolution encouraged countries to remove their ambassadors in Spain, and established the basis for measures against Spain if the government remained authoritarian. Only neighbouring Portugal, Ireland and a few Latin American, Arabian and Asian countries, refused to comply with this advice.

The consequence of all of this was the establishment of an [[embargo]] against the Francoist regime in 1946&amp;nbsp;— including the closure of the French border&amp;nbsp;— with very little success, as it boosted support for the regime. The isolation was represented by Franco's regime as a modern version of the [[Black Legend]], with the most fanatical partisans claiming it was a [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|machination]] of [[Jews]] and [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] against Catholic Spain. (Historian Vicente Carcel Orti asserts that [[Anticlericalism and Freemasonry|anticlerical Freemasons]] had in fact played a large part in the anti-Catholic acts of the prior Republican government since they held key government positions, including at least 183 deputies in the Cortes (the Spanish parliament), and thus were instrumental in the making of [[anti-Catholic]] laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Martyrs of Spain's Civil War&quot;&gt;Redzioch, Wlodzimierz (interviewing historian Vicente Carcel Orti) [http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=7999&amp;CFID=23811582&amp;CFTOKEN=60559071 The Martyrs of Spain's Civil War], Catholic Culture&lt;/ref&gt;) This impression of machination helped to rally significant popular support for the regime such as the large scale 1946 demonstration held in Madrid. In 1947, the president of Argentina, Juan Perón, ignored the UN embargo and sent his wife [[Eva Perón]] (Evita) with much needed food supplies.
After World War II, the Spanish economy was still in disarray. [[Rationing]] cards were still used as late as 1952. War and economic isolation prompted the regime to move towards [[autarky]], a movement warmly welcomed by Falangists. The tenets of the economy were: reduction of imports, self-sufficiency, state-controlled production and commercialization of first order goods, state-funded industry and construction of infrastructure&amp;nbsp;— heavily damaged during the Civil War&amp;nbsp;— through the use of improvised means.

In other aspects the regime continued showing its heavy-handedness when it withdrew the press credentials of six U.S. reporters in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,814792,00.html &quot;Censorship in Spain&quot; ''TIME'' April 30, 1951]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The end of isolation (1953–1959)===
[[Image:Franco eisenhower 1959 madrid.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Eisenhower and Franco in Spain in 1959]]
The increased tensions between the U.S. and the [[USSR]] in the 1950s led the American government to search for new allies in Europe. Franco's strong anti-Communist stance as well as the strategic location of Spain made the Spanish State a potential ally in the [[Cold War]].  This was demonstrated by the offer of the [[Blue Division]] to the U.S. in 1950, for service in the [[Korean War]], which was turned down.

Spain's international ostracism was finally broken in 1953 when Spain and the United States signed the [[Pact of Madrid]] in a series of agreements under which Spain received some financial benefits in the form of grants and loans in return for hosting American military bases (such as [[Naval Station Rota, Spain|Naval Station Rota]], opened in 1955). The same year, the Spanish government signed the ''[[Concordat of 1953|Concordat]]'' with the [[Holy See|Vatican]].

In 1955, Spanish wealth approached the pre-Civil War levels of 1935, leaving behind the disasters of the war and the struggle of isolation.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Helen and Labanyi, Jo (Eds.)

Spain. History]&lt;/ref&gt; Other Western European countries, including Italy, were from that point eager to restore good contacts with Francoist Spain.

Spain's gradual readmission to the international fold was given visible form with the visit of U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in December 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/trvl/pres/12794.htm Dwight D. Eisenhower&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Desarrollo'', the Spanish Miracle (1959–1973)===
[[Image:Seat 600 Granada.jpg|thumb|A SEAT 600.]]
{{Main|Spanish Miracle}}

The Spanish Miracle (''Desarrollo'') was the name given to the Spanish economic boom between 1959 and 1973. It is seen by some as the most remarkable positive legacy of the regime. During this period, Spain largely surpassed the per capita income that differentiates [[developed country|developed]] from [[underdeveloped countries]] and induced the development of a dominant [[middle class]].

The boom was bolstered by economic reforms promoted by the so-called &quot;[[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrat]]s&quot;, appointed by Franco, who pushed for public investment in infrastructure development, as recommended by the [[International Monetary Fund]]. The technocrats were a new breed of economists who replaced the old, prone to isolationism, [[Falangist]] guard.

The implementation of these policies took the form of development plans (''planes de Desarrollo'') and it was largely a success: Spain enjoyed the second highest growth rate in the world, just after Japan, and became the ninth [[List of largest economies in the world|largest economy in the world]], just after Canada.  Spain joined the industrialized world, leaving behind the poverty and endemic underdevelopment it had experienced since the loss of the [[Spanish Empire]] in the 19th century.
[[File:Spain After Franco.ogv|thumb|left|1971 newsreel film about Spain under Franco]] 
Although the economic growth produced noticeable improvements in Spanish living standards and the development of a middle class, Spain remained less economically advanced relative to the rest of Western Europe (with the exception of Portugal, Greece and Ireland). At the heyday of the Miracle, 1974, Spanish income per capita peaked at 79 percent of the Western European average, only to be reached again 25 years later, in 1999.

The 14 years of recovery led to an increase in (often unplanned) building on the periphery of the main Spanish cities to accommodate the new class of industrial workers brought by [[rural exodus]].

The icon of the ''Desarrollo'' was the [[SEAT 600]] (a license-built Italian [[Fiat]] [[Fiat 600|600]]) the first car for many Spanish working class families, produced by the Spanish factory [[SEAT]] or Sociedad Española de Automóviles de Turismo.

1969 also saw the Spanish government close the border with Gibraltar. Aircraft from Gibraltar were stopped from travelling to Spain or banned from using Spanish airspace. The border remained closed until the 1980s and air restrictions were only lifted in 2006.

===Franco's last years (1973–1975)===
The [[1973 oil crisis]] severely affected Spain, and brought the economic growth to a halt. This caused a new wave of strikes (nominally illegal at the time).

Franco's declining health during the early 1970s gave more power to Admiral [[Luis Carrero Blanco]], allegedly his caretaker and guardian of young Juan Carlos, the future king. Nevertheless, [[ETA]] was planning to assassinate Blanco, and finally, the commando led by [[Argala]], after two years of work, exploded a bomb which was located in a tunnel dig under the road he used to drive every morning. The operation was named [[Operación Ogro]] and it was highly celebrated especially in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and in the dissident areas of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Julen Agirre, translated by Barbara Probst Solomon (1975). Operation Ogro: The Execution of Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carlos Arias Navarro]] took over as [[President of the Spanish Government]], and tried to introduce some reforms to the decaying regime, but he struggled between the two factions of the regime, the conservative ''[[búnker]]'' and the ''aperturistas'', who promoted transition towards democracy.

But there was no way back to the old regime: Spain was not the same as in post-Civil War times and the model for the now wealthy Spaniards was the prosperous Western Europe, not the impoverished post-war Falangist Spain. Additionally, a considerable number of Spanish men had worked in [[Western Europe]] in the previous years as cheap labour forces, thereby encountering the economic growth and wealth of other western Europeans.

Meanwhile, in [[Western Sahara]] the situation became increasingly difficult, with the [[Polisario Front]] fighting for the independence against colonial troops in one hand, and the Moroccan regime wishing to annex the territory to [[Morocco]].

Led by [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Vicente Enrique y Tarancón|Tarancón]] and hand in hand with the reforms of the [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican Council II]], the Spanish [[Roman Catholic]] church had changed deeply by the last years of the Franco regime and could not be counted as supporting it anymore.

In July 1974 Franco fell ill, and [[Juan Carlos]] took over as Head of State. Franco soon recovered, but one year later he fell ill once again, and by late October 1975, he fell into a coma and was put on life support. After a long illness, Franco died on November 20, 1975, at the age of 82—the same date as the death of [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]], founder of the [[Falange]]. It is suspected that his doctors were ordered to keep him barely alive by artificial means until this symbolic date of the far-right.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The historian [[Ricardo de la Cierva]] says that on the 19th around 6 p.m. he was told that Franco had already died. After Franco's death, the interim government decided to bury him at [[Valle de los Caídos]], a colossal memorial to all the casualties of the [[Spanish Civil War]], although it was conceived by Franco and has a distinctly nationalist tone.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Upon Franco's death, Juan Carlos became the King of Spain and immediately used his absolute power to transition to a democratic and constitutional monarchy. The Spanish State ceased to exist in 1975 ''de facto'' during the [[Spanish transition to democracy]], and was officially over ''de jure'' after the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]].

==Government==
After Franco's victory in 1939, the FET y de las JONS (formed in 1937 by the FE de las JONS, the [[Carlists]], and several conservative groups) was declared the sole legal party in Spain, and asserted itself as the main component of the ''[[Movimiento Nacional]]''. In a [[state of emergency]]-like status, the 100 member [[central committee|national council]] (central committee) of the FET worked as makeshift legislature of Spain until the passing of the [[Organic law|Organic law of 1942]] (''Ley Organica'') and the Constituting of the Cortes Act (''Ley Constitutiva de las Cortes'') the same year, which saw the grand reopening of the [[Cortes Generales]] on July 18, 1942.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e02yoA0vFwI&amp;feature=related&lt;/ref&gt;

The Organic law stipulated the government to be ultimately responsible for all legislation of the country,&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies.us&quot;&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/spain/22.htm Spain - The Franco Years&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; while defining the Cortes of Spain as a purely advisory body elected by neither direct or universal suffrage. As all ministers were appointed on the grace of Franco as the &quot;Chief&quot; of state and government, he was monopolized as the one source of legislation. The law of national referendums (''Ley del Referendum Nacional''), passed in 1945 approved for all &quot;fundamental law&quot; to be approved by a popular referendum, in which only the family heads could vote. Local [[municipal council]]s were appointed similarly by family heads and local [[corporatism|corporations]] through elections, while the government exercised the exclusive right to appoint mayors. It was thus one of the most centralized countries in Europe, and certainly the most centralized in Western Europe following the fall of Portuguese dictator [[Marcelo Caetano]] in the [[Carnation Revolution]].

The law of referendums was exercised twice; in 1947, when a law [[Law of succession referendum, 1947|approved through a referendum]] revived the Spanish [[monarchy]] with Franco as interim regent [[president for life|for life]] with sole right to appoint his successor, secondly in 1966, [[Spanish organic law referendum, 1966|to approve of a new &quot;organic law&quot;]], or [[constitution]], supposedly limiting and clearly defining Franco's powers as well as formally creating the modern office of [[Prime Minister of Spain|President of the Government of Spain]]. By delaying the issue of republic versus monarchy for his 36-year dictatorship, and by refusing to take up the throne himself in 1947, Franco sought to antagonize neither the monarchical Carlists (who preferred the restoration of a Bourbon), nor the republican &quot;old shirts&quot;, i.e. the original Falangists. In 1961, Franco offered [[Otto von Habsburg]] the throne, but was refused, and ultimately followed Otto's recommendation by selecting the young [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos of Bourbon]] in 1969, shortly after his 30th birthday (the minimum age required under the Law of Succession).

==Colonial empire and decolonization==
{{See|Spanish Empire}}
Spain attempted to retain control the last remnants of its colonial empire throughout Franco's rule. During the [[Algerian War]] (1954–62), Madrid became the base of the ''[[Organisation de l'armée secrète]]'' (OAS) right-wing French Army group which sought to preserve [[French rule in Algeria|French Algeria]]. Despite this, Franco was forced to make some concessions. Henceforth, when [[French Morocco]] became independent in 1956, he surrendered [[Spanish Morocco]] to [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Mohammed V]], retaining only a few enclaves (the ''[[Plazas de soberanía]]''). The year after, Mohammed V invaded [[Spanish Sahara]] during the [[Ifni War]] (known as the &quot;Forgotten War&quot; in Spain). Only in 1975, with the [[Green March]] and the military occupation, did Morocco take control of all of the former Spanish territories in the Sahara.

In 1968, under United Nations pressure, Franco granted Spain's colony of [[Equatorial Guinea]] its independence, and the next year, ceded the [[exclave]] of [[Ifni]] to [[Morocco]]. Under Franco, Spain also pursued a campaign to gain sovereignty of the [[British overseas territory]] of [[Gibraltar]], and [[Disputed status of Gibraltar|closed its border with Gibraltar]] in 1969. The border would not be fully reopened until 1985.

==Francoism==
[[File:Franco0001.PNG|thumb|200px|Franco in 1969.]]
{{Falangism sidebar}}
The consistent points in Francoism included above all [[authoritarianism]], [[nationalism]] and anti-[[Anticlericalism and Freemasonry|Freemasonry]]; some authors also quote [[integralism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FBVCgetqZAAC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=franco+integralism&amp;source=web&amp;ots=kxe52hpW6n&amp;sig=5jM6bkwiTRB035W8R4ZuA4d5ByE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result Fundamentalism in comparative ... - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; All in all, Francoism showed a frontal rejection of [[Communism]], [[Socialism]] and [[Anarchism]]. Although Franco and Spain under his rule adopted some trappings of fascism, he, and Spain under his rule, are not generally considered to be fascist by scholars of fascism; among the distinctions, fascism entails a revolutionary aim to transform society, where Franco and Franco's Spain did not seek to do so, and, to the contrary, although authoritarian, were conservative and traditional.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franco and the Spanish Civil War&quot;&gt;De Menses, Filipe Ribeiro [http://books.google.com/books?id=InPG_1wKfCIC&amp;dq Franco and the Spanish Civil War], p. 87, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;Gilmour, David, [http://books.google.com/books?id=O-SEAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=&amp;pgis=1 The Transformation of Spain: From Franco to the Constitutional Monarchy], p. 7 1985 Quartet Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Payne, Stanley [http://books.google.com/books?id=NiD3UeOCSGsC&amp;dq Fascism in Spain, 1923–1977], p. 476 1999 Univ. of Wisconsin Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fascism in Spain, 1923–1977&quot;&gt;Payne, Stanley [http://books.google.com/books?id=NiD3UeOCSGsC&amp;dq Fascism in Spain, 1923–1977], p. 347, 476 1999 Univ. of Wisconsin Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fascism: Past, Present, Future&quot;/&gt;

[[Stanley Payne]], the preeminent scholar on fascism and Spain notes: &quot;scarcely any of the serious historians and analysts of Franco consider the generalissimo to be a core fascist.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter [http://books.google.com/books?id=fWggQTqioXcC&amp;dq Fascism: Past, Present, Future], p. 13, 1997 Oxford University Press US&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Walter Laqueur]] &quot;during the civil war, Spanish fascists were forced to subordinate their activities to the nationalist cause. At the helm were military leaders such as General Francisco Franco, who were conservatives in all essential respects. When the civil war ended, Franco was so deeply entrenched that the Falange stood no chance; in this strongly authoritarian  regime, there was no room for political opposition. The fascists became junior partners in the government and, as such, they had to accept responsibility for the regime's policy without being able to shape it substantially&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?hl=es&amp;id=fWggQTqioXcC&amp;q=spanish+fascism#v=snippet&amp;q=spanish%20fascism&amp;f=false Fascism: Past, Present, Future - Google Libros&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
Unlike [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]] (founder of the Falange and executed by the Republicans during the course of the war) Franco lacked any consistent political ideology other than fierce anti-communism.

Franco initially sought support from various groups, such as [[National syndicalism]] (''nacionalsindicalismo'') and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (''[[nacionalcatolicismo]]''). The [[Falange]], a fringe fascist inspired party during the Republic, soon transformed itself into the frame of reference{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} in the ''Movimiento Nacional''. In April 1937, the ''[[Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista]]'' (&quot;Spanish Traditionalist Phalanx of the Assemblies of National-Syndicalist Offensive&quot;, FET y de las JONS) was created from a merger of the [[Carlism|Carlist traditionalists]] with the ''[[Falange Española de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista]]'', which itself was issued of a merger of [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]]'s ''[[Falange Española]]'' with the national-syndicalist ''[[Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista]]'' (JONS).

===Authoritarianism===
Unlike other ideological-based regimes' parties, such as the Italian [[National Fascist Party]] and the German [[Nazi Party]], the FET-JONS were relatively heterogeneous instead of being an ideological monolith. Because of this, the Spanish State is generally considered to be authoritarian rather than fascist; among the distinctions, fascism entails a revolutionary aim to transform society, where Franco did not seek to do so, and, to the contrary, although authoritarian, were conservative and traditional.
&lt;ref name=&quot;Franco and the Spanish Civil War&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fascism in Spain, 1923–1977&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fascism: Past, Present, Future&quot;&gt;Laqueur, Walter [http://books.google.com/books?id=fWggQTqioXcC&amp;dq Fascism: Past, Present, Future] p. 13 1996 Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, the Falange opposed freer capital markets, but the ultimately prevailing [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]], many of whom were linked with [[Opus Dei]], eschewed syndicalist economics and favoured increased competition as a means of achieving rapid economic growth and integration with wider Europe which meant greater democracy.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Franco Years: Policies, Programs, and Growing Popular Unrest.&quot; ''A Country Study: Spain'' &lt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html#es0034&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

While it included fascist trappings, the Spanish State was very authoritarian: non-government [[trade union]]s and all political opponents across the [[political spectrum]] were either suppressed or tightly controlled by all means, including violent police repression. Most country towns and rural areas were patrolled by pairs of ''[[Guardia Civil (Spain)|Guardia Civil]]'', a military police for civilians, which functioned as his chief means of social control. Larger cities, and capitals, were mostly under the heavily-armed ''[[Cuerpo Nacional de Policía (Spain)|Policía Armada]]'', commonly called ''grises''.

Members of the oppressed ranged from trade unions to [[communism|communist]] and [[anarchism|anarchist]] organisations to [[liberal democracy|liberal democrats]] and [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan]] or [[Basque nationalism|Basque]] separatists. The ''[[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]]'' (CNT) and the ''[[Unión General de Trabajadores]]'' (UGT) trade-unions were outlawed, and replaced in 1940 by the corporatist ''[[Sindicato Vertical]]''. The [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) party and the ''[[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya]]'' (ERC) were banned in 1939, while the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] (PCE) went underground. University students seeking democracy revolted in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which was repressed by the ''grises''. The [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV) went into exile, and in 1959, the [[ETA]] armed group was created to wage a [[low-intensity warfare|low-intensity war]] against Franco. Franco, like others at the time{{Who|date=July 2007}}, evinced a concern about a possible [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] conspiracy against his regime. Some non-Spanish authors{{Who|date=July 2007}} have described it as being an &quot;obsession&quot;{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}.

Franco continued to personally sign all death warrants until just months before he died despite international campaigns requesting him to desist.

===Nationalism===
Franco's Spanish nationalism promoted a unitary national identity by repressing Spain's cultural diversity. [[Bullfighting]] and [[flamenco]]&lt;ref&gt;Roman, Mar. &quot;Spain frets over future of flamenco.&quot; 27 October 2007. Associated Press. [http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071027/ap_en_mu/flamenco_for_foreigners]&lt;/ref&gt; were promoted as national traditions while those traditions not considered &quot;Spanish&quot; were suppressed. Franco's view of Spanish tradition was somewhat artificial and arbitrary: while some regional traditions were suppressed, Flamenco, an [[Andalusia]]n tradition, was considered part of a larger, national identity. All cultural activities were subject to [[censorship]], and many were plainly forbidden (often in an erratic manner). This cultural policy relaxed with time, most notably in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Franco was reluctant to enact any form of administrative and legislative decentralisation and kept a fully centralised form of government with a similar administrative structure to that established by the [[House of Bourbon]] and General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera y Orbaneja]]. Such structures were both based in the model of the French centralised State. The main drawback of this kind of management is that government attention and initiatives were irregular, and often depended on the goodwill of regional Government representatives than on regional needs. Thus, inequalities in schooling, health care or transport facilities among regions were patent: classically affluent regions like Madrid, Catalonia, or the Basque Country fared much better than Extremadura, Galicia or Andalusia. Some regions, like Extremadura or La Mancha didn't have a university.

Franco dissolved the autonomy granted by the [[Second Spanish Republic]] to these two regions and to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. Franco abolished the centuries-old fiscal privileges and autonomy (the ''[[fueros]]'') in two of the three Basque provinces: [[Guipuzcoa]] and [[Biscay]], but kept them for [[Alava]]. Among Franco's greatest area of support during the civil war was [[Navarre]], also a Basque speaking region in its north half. Navarre remained a separated region from the Basque Country and Franco decided to preserve its also centuries' old fiscal privileges and autonomy, the so-called [[Fueros of Navarre]].

Franco also used [[Language politics in Spain under Franco|language politics]] in an attempt to establish national homogeneity. Despite Franco being Galician, in accordance with his nationalist principles, he abolished the official statute and recognition for the [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Galician language|Galician]], and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] languages that the [[Second Spanish Republic]] had granted for the first time in the history of Spain. He returned to [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as the only official language of the State and education, although millions of the country's citizens spoke other languages. The legal usage of languages other than Spanish was forbidden. All government, notarial, legal and commercial documents were to be drawn up exclusively in Spanish and any written in other languages were deemed null and void. The usage of any other language was forbidden in schools, in advertising, and on road and shop signs. Publications in other languages were generally forbidden, though citizens continued to speak other languages in private.

This was the situation throughout the 1940s and, to a lesser extent, during the 1950s, but after 1960 the non-Castilian Spanish languages were freely spoken and written and reached books, plays, and films. Even so, non-Castilian languages continued to be discouraged and never received official status: all government, notarial, legal and commercial documents were still drawn up exclusively in Spanish and any written in other languages were deemed null and void.

Additionally, the popularisation of the compulsory national educational system and the development of modern mass media, both controlled by the State and in Spanish language, and heavily reduced the number of speakers of Basque, Catalan and Galician, as happened during the second half of the 20th century with other European minority languages which were not officially protected like [[Scottish Gaelic]] or French [[Breton language|Breton]]. By the 1970s, the majority of the population in the urban areas could not speak in the [[minority language]] or, as in some Catalan towns, their use had been abandoned. The most endangered case was the Basque language. By the 1970s Basque had reached the point where any further reduction in the number of Basque speakers would have not guaranteed the necessary generational renewal and it is now recognised that the language would have disappeared in only a few more decades. This was the main reason that drove the Francoist provincial government of [[Alava]] to create a network of Basque medium schools ([[Ikastola]]) in 1973 which were State financed.

===Conservatism===
[[Catholicism]] was made the official religion of the Spanish State, which enforced Catholic social [[mores]]. The [[Catholic Church]] was established as the one religion of the Spanish State. The remaining nomads of Spain ([[Gitano]]s and [[Merchero]]s like [[Eleuterio Sánchez|El Lute]]) were especially affected. The Spanish State enforced Catholic behavior mainly by using a law (the ''Ley de Vagos y Maleantes'', Vagrancy Act) enacted by [[Manuel Azaña|Azaña]].&lt;ref&gt;http://search.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/tifs.php?coleccion=gazeta&amp;anyo=1933&amp;nbo=217&amp;lim=A&amp;pub=BOE&amp;pco=874&amp;pfi=877&lt;/ref&gt; Civil servants had to be Catholic, and some official jobs even required a &quot;good behavior&quot; statement by a priest. Civil marriages which had taken place under Republican Spain were declared null and void and had to be convalidated by the [[Catholic Church]] of Spain. Civil marriages were only possible after the couple made a public renunciation to the Catholic Church. Divorce, contraceptives and abortion were forbidden. From 1954 onwards, [[homosexuality]], [[pedophilia]], and [[prostitution]] were criminal offenses,&lt;ref&gt;http://search.boe.es/datos/imagenes/BOE/1954/198/A04862.tif&lt;/ref&gt; although the enforcement of this was seldom consistent.

Francoism professed a devotion to the traditional role of women in society, that is: loving child to her parents and brothers, faithful to her husband, residing with her family. Official propaganda confined her role to family care and motherhood. Most progressive laws passed by the Republic were made void, correspondingly. Women could not become judges, or testify in trial.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} They could not become university professors.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  In the 1960s and 1970s the situation became increasingly liberalized, finally reaching full liberalization after Franco's death.

Although a self-proclaimed monarchist, Franco had no particular desire for a king, due to his strained relations with the legitimate heir of the Crown, [[Don Juan de Borbón]]. Therefore, he left the throne vacant, with himself as de facto [[regent]]. In 1947 Franco proclaimed Spain a [[monarchy]], through the ''Ley de Sucesión en la Jefatura del Estado'' act, but did not designate a monarch.  Instead, he set the basis for his succession. This gesture was largely done to appease monarchist factions within the Movimiento. He wore the uniform of a captain general (a rank traditionally reserved for the King), resided in the royal [[Pardo Palace]], appropriated the kingly privilege of walking beneath a [[baldachin|canopy]], and his portrait appeared on most Spanish coins. Indeed, although his formal titles were Jefe del Estado (Head of State) and ''Generalísimo de los Ejércitos Españoles'' ([[Generalissimo]] of the Spanish Armed Forces), he was referred to as ''Caudillo de España por la gracia de Dios,'' ([[by the Grace of God]], the Leader of Spain). ''Por la Gracia de Dios'' is a technical, legal formulation which states sovereign dignity in [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]], and had only been used by monarchs before Franco used it himself. The long-delayed selection of Juan Carlos de Borbón as Franco's official successor in 1969 was an unpleasant surprise for many interested parties, as Juan Carlos was the rightful heir for neither the Carlists nor the Legitimists{{Citation needed|reason=21-9-2009|date=September 2009}}.

== Economic policy ==
{{See also|Economic history of Spain#The Franco Era.2C 1939-75|l1=Economic history of Spain: Economy under Franco}}
[[File:Spanish peseta coin with Franco 1963.gif|thumb|left|200px|1963 [[Spanish peseta]] coin with the image of Franco, saying ''Caudillo de España, por la gracia de Dios'' (''Francisco Franco, Leader of Spain, by the grace of God'').]]
The Civil War had ravaged the Spanish economy.  Infrastructure had been damaged, workers killed, and daily business severely hampered.  For more than a decade after Franco's victory, the economy improved little. Franco initially pursued a policy of [[autarky]], cutting off almost all international trade.  The policy had devastating effects, and the economy stagnated. Only black marketeers could enjoy an evident affluence.

In 1940, the [[Sindicato Vertical|&quot;Vertical Trade Union&quot;]] was created; it was inspired by the ideas of [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}, who thought that [[class struggle]] would be ended by grouping together workers and owners according to [[corporate state|corporative]] principles. It was the only legal trade union, and was under government control. Other trade unions were forbidden and strongly repressed along with political parties outside the FET-JONS.

On one occasion, a Czech engineer and con-man managed to convince the general that with the waters of the River Jarama and certain herbs and secret powders, Spain could get all the petroleum it needed. On another, he was convinced of a plan to solve the country’s terrible hunger of the 1940s by feeding the population of 30 million with dolphin sandwiches. (La Memoria Insumisa, Nicolás Sartorius y Javier Alfaya, 1999). Indeed in the background of these economic policies some 200,000 people died of hunger{{Dubious|date=July 2009}} in the early years of Francoism, a period known as ''Los Años de Hambre'' (the Years of Hunger).

On the brink of bankruptcy, a combination of pressure from the USA, the IMF and technocrats from Opus Dei managed to “convince” the regime to adopt a free market economy in 1959 in what amounted to a mini coup d’etat which removed the old guard in charge of the economy, despite the opposition of Franco. This economic liberalisation was not, however, accompanied by political reforms and repression continued unabated, though these very reforms would lead to socio-economic changes in Spanish society which would make the regime’s continuation 16 years later untenable.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Economic growth picked up after 1959 after Franco took authority away from these ideologues and gave more power to the [[Economic liberalism|liberal]] technocrats.  The country implemented several development policies and growth took off creating the &quot;[[Spanish Miracle]]&quot;. Concurrent with the absence of social reforms, and the economic power shift, a tide of mass emigration commenced: to European countries, and to lesser extent, to South America. Emigration helped the Régime in two ways:  the country got rid of surplus population, and the emigrants supplied the country with much needed monetary remittances.

During the 1960s, the population, mainly the wealthier segments, experienced further increases in wealth, particularly those who remained politically faithful. International firms established their factories in Spain: salaries were low, taxes nearly non existent, strikes were forbidden, labour health or real state regulations were unheard of, and Spain was virtually a virgin market. Spain became the second-fastest growing economy in the world, just behind [[Japan]]). The rapid development of this period became known as the Spanish Miracle. At the time of Franco's death, Spain still lagged behind most of Western Europe, but the gap between its GDP per capita and that of the major Western European economies had greatly narrowed; in world terms, Spain was already enjoying a fairly high material standard of living with basic but comprehensive services. However, the period between the mid 1970s and mid 1980s was to prove difficult as, in addition to the [[oil shocks]] to which Spain was highly exposed, the settling of the new political order took priority over the modernising of the economy.

== Legacy ==
[[File:Santa Cruz del Valle de los Caídos.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Franco is entombed in the monument of [[Valle de los Caídos|Santa Cruz del Valle de los Caídos]].]]
[[File:Francoayto.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Equestrian statue of ''Generalissimo'' Franco in the ''Plaza del Ayuntamiento'' (City Hall Plaza) of [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]]. It was retired in late 2008.]]
In Spain and abroad, the legacy of Franco remains controversial. In Germany a squadron named after [[Werner Mölders]] has been renamed, because as a pilot he led the escorting units in the [[bombing of Guernica]]. As recently as 2006, the BBC reported that [[Maciej Giertych]], an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] of the right-wing [[League of Polish Families]], had expressed admiration for Franco's stature who allegedly &quot;guaranteed the maintenance of traditional values in Europe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5151504.stm Europe diary: Franco and Finland], [[BBC News]], 6 July 2006 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But this is not the most shared opinion. Several statues of Franco and other public Francoist symbols have been removed, with the last statue in Madrid coming down in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4357373.stm Madrid removes last Franco statue], [[BBC News]], 17 March 2005 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Permanent Commission of the [[European Parliament]] &quot;firmly&quot; condemned in a resolution unanimously adopted in March 2006 the &quot;multiple and serious violations&quot; of [[human rights]] committed in Spain under the Francoist regime from 1939 to 1975.&lt;ref name=EP&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/03/17/espana/1142617936.html Primera condena al régimen de Franco en un recinto internacional], [[EFE]], ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'', 17 March 2006 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Martyna Czarnowska, [http://www.wienerzeitung.at/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabID=4399&amp;Alias=Dossiers&amp;cob=189475&amp;DosCob=164869 Almunia, Joaquin: EU-Kommission (4): Ein halbes Jahr Vorsprung], ''Weiner Zeitung'', 17 February 2005 (article in German language). Accessed 26 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution was at the initiative of the MEP Leo Brincat and of the historian Luis María de Puig, and is the first international official condemnation of the repression enacted by Franco's regime.&lt;ref name=EP/&gt; The resolution also urged to provide public access to historians (professional and amateurs) to the various [[archive]]s of the Francoist regime, including those of the ''Fundación Francisco Franco'' which, as well as other Francoist archives, remain as of 2006 inaccessible to the public.&lt;ref name=EP/&gt; Furthermore, it urged the Spanish authorities to set up an underground [[art exhibition|exhibition]] in the [[Valle de los Caídos]] monument, in order to explain the &quot;terrible&quot; conditions in which it was built.&lt;ref name=EP/&gt; Finally, it proposes the construction of monuments to commemorate Franco's victims in Madrid and other important cities.&lt;ref name=EP/&gt;

In Spain, a commission to repair the dignity and restitute the memory of the victims of Francoism (''Comisión para reparar la dignidad y restituir la memoria de las víctimas del franquismo'') was approved in the summer of 2004, and is directed by the vice-president [[María Teresa Fernández de la Vega]].&lt;ref name=EP/&gt;

The late Franco was a prominent and frequent subject of jokes on early episodes of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', see &quot;[[Generalissimo Francisco Franco is still dead]]&quot;.

Because of his language policies, Franco's legacy is still particularly poorly perceived in [[Catalonia]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]. The Basque Country and Catalonia were among the regions that offered the strongest resistance to Franco in the Civil War, as well as during his regime.

Recently the [[Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory]] (ARHM) initiated a systematic search for mass graves of people executed during Franco's regime, which has been supported since the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]]'s victory during the [[Spanish general election, 2004|2004 elections]] by [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]]'s government. A ''Ley de la memoria histórica de España'' (Law on the Historical Memory of Spain) was passed in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12304721 |title=Bones of Contention |accessdate=2008-10-06 |date=2008-09-27 |work=The Economist |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5bLyvad0B |archivedate=2008-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law is supposed to enforce an official recognition of the crimes committed against civilians during the Francoist rule and organize under state supervision the search for mass graves.

== Flags and heraldry ==
=== Flags ===
At the conclusion of the Spanish Civil War, and in spite of the army's reorganisation, several sections of the army continued with their bi-colour flags improvised in 1936, but since 1940 new ensigns began to be distributed, whose main innovation was the addition of the [[eagle (heraldry)|eagle]] of [[John the Evangelist]] to the shield. The new arms were allegedly inspired in the coat of arms the [[Catholic Monarchs]] adopted after the taking of [[Granada]] from the [[Moors]], but replacing the arms of [[Sicily]] with those of [[Navarre]] and adding the [[Pillars of Hercules]] on either side of the coat of arms. In 1938 the columns were placed outside the wings. On July 26, 1945 the commander's ensigns were suppressed by decree, and on October 11, a detailed regulation of flags was published that fixed the model of the bi-colour flag in use, but better defined its details, emphasising a greater{{clarify|date=September 2011}} style of the Saint John's eagle. The models established by this decree remained in force until 1977.

During this period two more flags were usually displayed along with the national flag: the flag of [[Falange|Spanish Falange]] (three vertical strips, red, black and red, with the black stripe wider than the red, and the ''[[yoke]] and arrows'' emblem in red in the centre of the black stripe) and the [[Carlist]] flag (the Saint Andrew [[saltire]] or [[Cross of Burgundy Flag|Cross of Burgundy]] red on white), representing the [[Movimiento Nacional|National Movement]] which had unified Falange and the [[Requetés]] under the name ''Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS''.

From the death of Franco in 1975 until 1977, the national flag followed the 1945 regulations. On 21 January 1977 a new regulation was approved that stipulated an eagle with more open wings, (&quot;pasmada&quot; eagle), with the restored Pillars of Hercules placed within the wings, and the tape with the motto UNA, GRANDE Y LIBRE (ONE, GREAT and FREE) moved over the eagle's head from its previous position around the neck.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Standards===
From 1940 to 1975, Franco used the Castilian Bend (like the version of Charles I) as Head of State’s Standard and [[Colours, standards and guidons|Guidon]]: The Bend between the Pillars of Hercules, crowned with an imperial crown and open (old) royal crown.

Juan Carlos I, as Prince of Spain from 1969 to 1975, used a royal standard which was virtually identical to the one later adopted when he was became King in 1975. The earlier standard differed only that it featured the royal crown of a Crown Prince, the King's royal crown has 8 arches of which 5 are visible, while the Prince's one has only 4 arches of which 3 are visible. The Royal Standard of Spain consists of a dark blue square with the Coat of arms of the King in the center. The King's Guidon is identical to the standard, differing it in that it incorporates a fringe.

File:Estandarte del infante Juan Carlos de Borbón como Príncipe de España.svg|[[Royal Standard of Spain|Standard Juan Carlos I, as Prince of Spain]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Coat of arms===
In 1938, Franco adopted a variant of the Coat of Arms reinstating some elements originally used by the [[House of Trastámara]] such as Saint John's eagle and the yoke and bundle, as follows: Quarterly, 1 and 4. quarterly Castile and León, 2 and 3. per pale Aragon and Navarra, enté en point of Granada. The arms are crowned with an open royal crown, placed on eagle displayed sable, surrounded with the pillars of Hercules, the yoke and the bundle of arrows of the Catholic Monarchs.

'''Joaquín Almunia Amann''' (born 17 June 1948) is a [[politics of Spain|Spanish politician]] and prominent member of the [[European Commission]], currently responsible for Competition under the second mandate of President Barroso. He was previously responsible for Economic and Monetary Affairs in Barroso's previous mandate. The president of the Commission, [[José Manuel Barroso]], had announced on 27 November 2009 that Almunia would be a Vice-President and the responsible for [[European Commissioner for Competition|Competition]] in the second college of the [[Barroso Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.net/2009/11/27/barroso-names-new-eu-commission-team/ Barroso names new EU commission team. Euronews]. Retrieved 27 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Bilbao]], he is married and has two children. He graduated in Law and Economics at the [[University of Deusto]], and completed follow-up studies at the [[École Pratique des Hautes Études]] in Paris and the “Senior managers in Government” program at the [[Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]]. He was an associate lecturer on Employment and Social Security Law at the [[University of Alcalá de Henares]].

Almunia was chief economist of the [[Unión General de Trabajadores]], the Spanish [[trade union]] affiliated to the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE), from 1976 to 1979. He was economist at the Council Bureau of the Spanish Chambers of Commerce in [[Brussels]] from 1972 to 1975.

Almunia was a PSOE Member of the [[Cortes Generales]] from [[Spanish general election, 1979|1979]] to 2004, representing [[Madrid (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Madrid]]. He was Minister of Employment and Social Security from 1982 to 1986 and Minister of Public Administration from 1986 to 1991, and was PSOE spokesperson from 1994 to 1997. Upon the resignation of [[Felipe González]] after being defeated in the [[Spanish general election, 1996|1996 elections]], Almunia became the party leader from 1997 to 2000. In [[Spanish general election, 2000|2000]], he was the PSOE candidate for [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]], and the party was again defeated by incumbent Prime Minister, [[José María Aznar]]. The PSOE suffered its worst result in a General Election since the [[Spanish transition to democracy|Transition]] times and Almunia resigned as party leader.

Almunia was director of the research program on ''Equality and redistribution of income'' at the [[Fundación Argentaria]] from 1991 to 1994. In 2002, he founded and was director of the progressive think tank ''[[Laboratorio de Alternativas]]''.

He first joined the Prodi Commission on 26 April 2004 as a successor to [[Pedro Solbes]] (who had resigned to join the new [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero|Zapatero Government]]) and was re-appointed by Barroso in November 2004.

[[Don (honorific)|Don]] '''José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero''' ({{IPA-es|xoseˈlwiz roˈðɾiɣeθ θapaˈteɾo|-|Es-zapatero.ogg}};&lt;ref&gt;In ''Diccionario panhispánico de dudas'', [http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/SrvltGUIBusDPD?lema=acento#11b acento], it is said explicitly that José Luis is pronounced [joseluís], i.e. [[IPA]] [xose'lwis] or [xose'lwiz]. The provided audio file confirms this.&lt;/ref&gt; born 4 August 1960) is a member of the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE). He was elected for two terms as [[Prime Minister of Spain]], in the [[Spanish legislative election, 2004|2004]] and [[Spanish legislative election, 2008|2008]] general elections. On 2 April 2011 he announced he would not stand for re-election in the [[Spanish general election, 2011|2011 general election]]. After the crushing defeat his party suffered in the elections, he left office on 21 December 2011.

Among the main actions taken by the Zapatero administration, were [[Multi-National Force - Iraq#2004 withdrawals|the withdrawal of Spanish troops from the Iraq war]], which allegedly resulted in long term diplomatic tensions with the [[George W. Bush administration]]; the increase of Spanish troops in [[Afghanistan]]; the idea of an [[Alliance of Civilizations]], co-sponsored by Turkish Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]; the legalisation of [[same-sex marriage]]; reform of abortion law; a controversial attempt at [[ETA's 2006 &quot;permanent ceasefire&quot;|peace negotiation]] with [[ETA]]; the increase of [[tobacco smoking|tobacco]] restrictions; and the reform of various [[Autonomous Community|Autonomous statutes]], particularly the [[Statute of Catalonia]].

==Personal life==
===Family background===
José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero was born in [[Valladolid]], [[Castile and León]], to Juan Rodríguez y García-Lozano (b. 1928), a [[lawyer]], and María de la Purificación Zapatero y Valero ([[Valladolid]], 1927 – [[Madrid]], 30 October 2000). He grew up in [[León, Spain|León]], where his family originated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His paternal grandfather, Juan Rodríguez y Lozano (28 July 1893 – [[Puente Castro]], [[León (province)|León]], 18 August 1936), was a [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] [[Captain (land and air)|captain]], executed by Franco's National army a month into the [[Spanish Civil War]], for refusing to fight with them.&lt;ref name=&quot;cidob&quot;&gt;[http://www.cidob.org/es/documentacion/biografias_lideres_politicos/europa/espana/jose_luis_rodriguez_zapatero Center for International Relations and Development Studies](text in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; He was betrayed and his whereabouts were revealed by certain PSOE people in Valladolid, before Rodriguez Zapatero was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|es|''Zapatero. Presidente a la Primera''}}. 1st ed. updated. ({{lang|es|La Esfera de los Libros}}, Spain, April 2004). ISBN 84-9734-193-7. p.  54&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, his maternal grandfather supported the coup d'état of Franco. 

His maternal grandfather, Faustino Zapatero y Coronel, was a [[paediatrics|paediatrician]] and [[middle class]] [[Liberalism|liberal]] who died in 1978. His maternal grandmother María de la Natividad Valero y Asensio ([[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]], 9 December 1902 – Valladolid, 28 June 2006) was a [[right-wing]] [[conservative]] and died at age 103.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OCAM|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zapatero was born in Valladolid not only because of his mother's attachment to her family, who lived there, but also because of the medical profession of her father.

Zapatero has said that, as a youngster, &quot;as I remember it, I used to participate in late night conversations with my father and brother about politics, law or literature&quot;. However, he did not get on very well with his father at times. Sources say that his father refused to let him work or take any part in his buffet,{{clarify|date=November 2011}} and this scarred him for life.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{cite OCAM|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says that his family taught him to be tolerant, thoughtful, prudent and austere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page= 294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The memory of Republican Captain Rodríguez y Lozano was also kept alive by his last [[will (law)|will]], handwritten 24 hours before facing the firing squad, and which can be considered a final declaration of principles. The will comprised six parts, the first three bestowing his possessions on his heirs; the fourth, in which he asked for a civil burial and, the fifth, in which he requested his family to forgive those who had tried and executed him and proclaiming his belief in the [[Supreme Being]]. In the sixth, Zapatero's grandfather asked his family to clear his name in the future as his creed consisted only in his &quot;love for peace, for good and for improving the living conditions of the lower classes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages= 51 fol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zapatero is a supporter of [[FC Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/377088531.html?dids=377088531:377088531&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+29%2C+2003&amp;author=Steven+Goff&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=Barça+Isn%27t+Lounging+Around%3B+Storied+Catalonian+Club+Plots+Its+Return+to+the+Top|title=Barça Isn't Lounging Around; Storied Catalonian Club Plots Its Return to the Top|first=Steven|last=Goff|work=The Washington Post | date=29 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nation.ittefaq.com/issues/2008/07/02/news0376.htm|agency=Associated Press|title=Spain's football team welcomed by royals|work=The New Nation|accessdate=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies and teaching===
He studied Law at the [[University of León]], graduating in 1982. His performance as a student was above average before his pre-University year. His grades later in the year and in the University were essentially mediocre. According to his brother Juan: &quot;He didn't study much but it made no difference, he continued successfully&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page= 71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating, Zapatero worked as a teaching assistant in constitutional law at the University of León until 1986 (he continued working some hours a week without pay until 1991). It was subsequently found that he had been appointed by his department without the usual selection process involving interviews and competitive examinations, which if true, constitutes a case of political favouritism.&lt;ref name=&quot;cidob&quot;/&gt; He has declared that the only activity that attracts him besides politics is teaching or, at most, academic research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodríguez Zapatero met [[Sonsoles Espinosa]] in León in 1981. They married on 27 January 1990 and have two daughters named Laura (b. 1993) and Alba (b. 1995).

In October 1991, his contract was cancelled by the new rector of the University of León, Julio César Santoyo, after the University's legal advisers considered Zapatero's posts as a teaching assistant and an MP to be incompatible (he had been elected in 1986). The [[Cortes Generales|Spanish Parliament]]'s counselors, however, had considered the contract valid.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Zapatero did not do the military service which was compulsory in Spain: he received successive deferments because of his conditions as a university student and a teaching assistant. As an [[Member of Parliament|MP]] he was finally exempted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zapatero enters politics===
Zapatero attended his first political rally, organized by the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) in [[Gijón]] in 1976. Some political parties had been legal since 21 July 1976, but the PSOE was not legalized until February 1977. The speech of [[Felipe González]], the PSOE leader and future [[Prime Minister of Spain]], who took part in the rally, exerted an important influence on Zapatero. He said, among other things, that &quot;the Socialists' goal was the seizure of power by the [[working class]] to transform the ownership of the [[means of production]]&quot; and that &quot;the PSOE was a revolutionary party but not ''revolutionarist'' or ''aventurist'' [...], as it defended the use of elections to come to power&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages= 29 fol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zapatero and his family had been traditionally attracted to the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party]] as it was the only party really organized before [[Francisco Franco]]'s death in 1975.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} But, after the famous political rally in Gijón, they, and especially Zapatero, started to believe that the Socialist Party was the most probable future for the Spanish [[political left|left]].&lt;ref name=&quot;p111&quot;&gt;{{cite OCAM| page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the Socialist Party was rebuilding its infrastructure in the province of León after having been outlawed following the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page= 110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the year of the first democratic elections after Franco's death, Zapatero supported both the Communist and Socialist parties. He pasted posters of both parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;p111&quot;/&gt;

He eventually joined the PSOE on 23 February 1979. The impression Felipe González had caused on him in 1976 played a fundamental role in his decision to join the party. In 1979, during the [[Congreso Extraordinario del PSOE (1979)]], the PSOE had renounced [[Marxism]] as its ideological base. He said nothing about joining the party at home, because he was afraid his parents would discourage him, considering him too young to join a political party.

In 1982, Zapatero became head of the socialist youth organization in the province of [[León (province)|León]]. In July 1982, he met Felipe González at the summer school &quot;Jaime Vera&quot; and suggested that he make a &quot;left turn&quot; in the PSOE political program for the General Election of October 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page= 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; González answered advising him to abandon his conservative [leftist] viewpoint.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

In 1986, he was elected to represent the province of León in the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] (Parliament), becoming its youngest member after the election held on 20 June. He was number two on the PSOE list for [[León (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|León]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page= 130}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following elections (those held in 1989, 1993, 1996 and 2000) he was number one on the list. In the elections of 2004 he ran for [[Madrid (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Madrid]] as number one.

Zapatero defined himself as a &quot;left-wing conservative&quot; at the time. He explained that he meant that, for sentimental reasons linked to his family, he came from the left that lost the Spanish Civil War and that what had happened between 1936–1939 (the duration of the war) and 1939–1975 ([[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s regime) had a very important significance for him. He further explained that the Spanish left needed to modernize and that &quot;we are finding it difficult to accept the need for the Socialist Party to change many of its ideological parameters and overcome our own conservatism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page= 141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 he became Secretary General in León after a complex internal fight for power that ended a long period of division. In fact, before the provincial conference held that year, [[Ramón Rubial]], then national president of the PSOE, had asked the party in León to foster unity. Zapatero was elected as Secretary General at that conference, leading to a period of stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s and 1990s, the PSOE consisted of two factions: the ''Guerristas'' (supporters of [[Alfonso Guerra]], former vice-president under Felipe González) and the reformers (led by Felipe González). The first group had a stronger left-wing ideology whereas the second was more pragmatic. The division became wider after the General Election of 1993, the last election won by the PSOE before [[José María Aznar]]'s victory in 1996, when the bad results exacerbated the internal conflicts. Zapatero never formally joined either of those two groups.

In 1993, the Socialist Federation of León (FSL – Federación Socialista de León) suffered an important scandal. Some towns experienced unusually sharp increases in PSOE membership in a very short period of time. When some of the supposed new members were questioned by the press, they stated that they were unaware of their membership and that they did not live in the places where they were being registered by the party. It seems that some opponents of Zapatero in León, perhaps with the support of powerful ''Guerristas'' at the top of the Spanish Socialist Party wanted to increase their influence within it by increasing the number of members in the towns of León favorable to them. Their main aim would have been to take control of the Regional Socialist Section of [[Castilla y León]] in the conference to be held in 1994. Zapatero's support for the then Regional Secretary General, Jesús Quijano transformed him into the enemy of the ''Guerristas'' in the region as the FSL is the most important Provincial Section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=169 fol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1994 two papers, ''[[El País]]'' and ''[[Diario de León]]'', published several articles that suggested irregularities in his appointment as a Professor by the [[University of León]] and in his keeping the job until 1991. The suspicions of political favoritism were favored by his having been directly appointed without a prior selection process open to other candidates. On 20 May 1994, he held a press conference where he rejected these accusations. Zapatero attributed to &quot;ignorance&quot; or &quot;bad faith&quot; the content of the articles and linked them to the internal fight for the job of Secretary General of the Regional Chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=102 fol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, three regional conferences were going to be held: two to elect the representatives of the party in León for the Regional and National Conferences to take place that year, and the 7th Provincial conference where the Secretary General was going to be elected.

Before they began, an agreement between the parties involved was drawn up. The new members who did not confirm they had joined the party voluntarily and who did not live in the areas where they were registered would be expelled from the party. Initially 775, and finally 577, new memberships were canceled out of 1160 suspicious memberships.

When the three conferences were held, the tension was very high and, sometimes it was even necessary to call the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of them were finally won by Zapatero or his supporters.

The National Conference (held after most of the representatives elected in the first León Conference were Zapatero's supporters) was won by the ''reformers'', at that time strongly opposed to the ''Guerristas''. That was positive for Zapatero as the list of bogus party members was revised again. Their number grew from 577 to almost 900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zapatero was finally reelected secretary general with 68 percent of the ballots in the 7th Regional Conference held in July 1994, following the removal of the false memberships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=100 &amp; 192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, new regional and local elections were held. The results were bad for the PSOE in León as they lost four seats in the mayoralty of León and two seats in the regional parliament of Castilla-León. The results were influenced by the bad economic situation and the cases of corruption assailing the party. Zapatero had personally directed the electoral campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, after the General Election, Zapatero kept his seat at the Congress of Deputies. The following year, Zapatero was elected again Secretary General of León and after the national conference held by the party that year he entered the National Executive (the party governing body).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the first and only primaries held within the PSOE took place. There were two candidates: [[Joaquín Almunia]] and [[José Borrell]]. The regional party of León declared itself to be neutral. It seems that, unofficially, its leaders including Zapatero, worked harder in favor of Almunia, who was the representative of the reformers and opposed the ''Guerristas''. Zapatero himself phoned personally (as other leaders did) as many party members as possible to request their votes for Almunia.

On 24 April 1998, Borrell won with 9.6% more votes than Almunia in Spain and 4.6% more in León. It seems that Borrell's image of reform played an important role in his victory. Borrell's attitude towards Zapatero seems to have been a little colder after Zapatero's support for his rival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=210 fol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of two leaders Joaquín Almunia, Secretary General, and Josep Borrell, official candidate, caused problems within the PSOE, used to being directed only by the Secretary General. Finally, two former close associates of Borrell were accused of having been corrupt when they worked for him in the Spanish Government, and he resigned, alleging that he did not want to damage his party with the scandal. Almunia replaced him and ran for the Spanish Premiership in the General Elections held in 2000.

The Association of Parliamentary Journalists awarded to Zapatero the &quot;Diputado Revelación&quot; prize (something like ''Most promising MP of the year'') in December 1999 for his activities as a member of the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]]. From 1996 until 2000, his most conspicuous contributions as an MP were his vigorous opposition to the electrical protocol proposed by the government (initially negative for the important coal sector of León), being the PSOE spokesman in the Commission of Public Administration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; and probably his most important success as an MP: the passing of an amendment to the national budget of 2000 in November 1999 that increased the pensions of the non-professional soldiers who fought for the Republic during the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939. They were made equal to those of the professional military. The initiative was defended by him in the name of the Parliamentary Socialist Group, proponent of the amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appointment as Secretary General of the Socialist Party===
On 12 March 2000, the PSOE had lost its second successive election to José María Aznar's [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]]. Zapatero held his seat, but the Socialist Party obtained only 125 seats, 16 fewer than in 1996. The defeat was especially bitter as the People's Party unexpectedly obtained an absolute majority for the first time and the socialist result was worse than in the previous election. Almunia announced his resignation on the very day the General Election took place.

Zapatero decided to run for the leadership of the Socialist Party in its 35th Conference to be held in June that year. Together with other socialist members, he founded a new faction within the party called ''Nueva Vía'' (New Way) in April 2000, to serve him as a platform to become Secretary General. The name of ''Nueva Vía'' is a mix of [[Tony Blair]]'s ''[[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]]'' (''tercera vía'' in Spanish) and [[Gerhard Schröder]]'s ''[[Neue Mitte]]'' (''new center'' or ''nuevo centro'' in Spanish).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 June 2000 Zapatero officially announced his intention to run for the federal Secretaryship General at an Extraordinary Conference of the Socialist Party of León.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech, he stated what can be considered his declaration of principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# To build a society that would accept all foreigners notwithstanding their color or cultural background.
# To give priority to education and to create good jobs for youngsters.
# To provide parents with more time to spend with their children and in taking care of their elders.
# To promote culture and its creators, making it possible for them to grab the spotlight from those aiming only at economic interests.
# To convert Spain into a country admired for helping those with more needs.
# To force the government to help those with initiative and enterprising qualities.
# To foster democracy, to lend distinction to politics and to promote values over temporary interests.

[[Pasqual Maragall]] was the only regional leader of the Socialist Party who officially supported him before the Conference was held. José Borrell also decided to support him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zapatero ran against three other opponents ([[José Bono]], [[Rosa Díez]] and [[Matilde Fernández]]). Matilde Fernández was the candidate of the ''guerristas'' while José Bono was the candidate of the ''reformers''. Rosa Díez is a Basque politician who was a kind of intermediate option.

Zapatero was a ''dark horse'' who had against him his inexperience and in favour his image of reform and being the only MP among the candidates. (All the Spanish opposition leaders had been MPs before winning the elections. A very important factor in Spanish politics where electoral campaigns last for only 15 days and to be widely known long before they begin is essential.) Bono was deeply disliked by the ''guerristas'', who also favoured Zapatero.

Zapatero finally won by a relatively small margin (he obtained 414 votes out of 995 and José Bono obtained 405) on 22 July 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/noticias/2000/7/23/espana/964312046.html XXXV CONGRESO: José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, nuevo secretario general del PSOE]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The margin was relatively small because Bono had no likelihood of winning since the supporters of the other two candidates preferred Zapatero as their second choice. Zapatero accepted the cancellation of a run-off between himself and Bono because he was sure of his victory after only one ballot and he apparently did not want to humiliate his adversary.

After being elected Secretary General, he was congratulated by [[Lionel Jospin]] (then the [[Prime Minister of France]]), [[Gerhard Schröder]] ([[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor of Germany]]) and José María Aznar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to [[Madrid]] with his family that year. As a Congressman he had lived from Monday to Thursday in Madrid and the rest of the time in León.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition leader==
This was the period when Zapatero was appointed as Secretary General  of the PSOE in 2000 until he became [[Prime Minister of Spain]] on 14 March 2004.

===Style of opposition===
Zapatero has always claimed to base his political activity on his love of dialogue. When he was an opposition leader, he liked to contrast his behaviour with the &quot;arrogant&quot;, &quot;[[authoritarianism|authoritarian]]&quot; approach of the People's Party and, especially, that of its leader José María Aznar.

As a result, after being appointed Secretary General, he coined the term ''Calm Opposition'' (''{{lang|es|Oposición Tranquila}}'') to refer to his opposition strategy. The ''Calm Opposition'' was supposedly based on an &quot;open to dialogue&quot;, &quot;soft&quot;, &quot;constructive&quot; attitude (''talante constructivo'', coined as ''talante'') aimed not at damaging the government but at achieving the &quot;best&quot; for the people. (Zapatero has insisted on this point so many times that the term ''talante'' has become very popular in Spain.) Because of this supposed tactic, Zapatero received nicknames like &quot;[[Bambi]]&quot; or &quot;Sosoman&quot; (where &quot;Soso&quot;—meaning dull, insipid, bore—replaces &quot;Super&quot; in &quot;[[Superman]]&quot;), especially in the first months after being appointed General Secretary.

During Zapatero's years as an opposition leader (and later as Prime Minister), the tension between left-wing and right-wing supporters increased and, according to some opinions, a real radicalization of the society took (and is taking) place {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}. Zapatero's supporters blame his opponents for that and the People's Party blames him stating facts such as the increase in the acts of violence committed against them, especially in the months before and during the [[war in Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertaddigital.com/php3/noticia.php3?cpn=1275756079 Libertad Digital: Nacional :: Triple ataque con cócteles molotov contra dos sedes del PP en Galicia y una oficina de la Xunta]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a new term has become popular: ''guerracivilismo''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.es/search?q=guerracivilismo |title=guerracivilismo – Buscar con Google |publisher=Google.es |date=2010-05-15 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (made up of a combination of the Spanish for Civil War and the -ismo [[suffix]], equivalent to the [[English language|English]] -ism), which would refer to the growing enmity of right and left-wing factions.

===2000 and 2001===
Zapatero's criticisms of the government were very active from the beginning. His first attack against the government was based on its inability to control the rise in the price of [[fossil fuel]]. He asked for a reduction in the taxes affecting it.

In 2000, the [[Great Britain|British]] [[nuclear submarine]] ''[[HMS Tireless (S88)|HMS Tireless]]'' arrived at [[Gibraltar]] harbour to have its [[nuclear reactor]] repaired. Aznar affirmed that there was no risk for the population but Zapatero criticized him for his inability to force the British government to take the submarine to another harbour. After almost one year, the Tireless was repaired and left Gibraltar without having caused any known problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2001/05/04/espana/988995858.html |title=El 'Tireless' abandona Gibraltar, después de permanecer un año varado en el puerto del Peñón |publisher=Elmundo.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2001/05/10/espana/989488163.html |title=El Tribunal Supremo archiva la querella criminal contra Aznar y Blair por el 'caso Tireless' |publisher=Elmundo.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another point of friction came from the scheme to transfer water from the River Ebro to other areas especially the irrigated areas in the South East of Spain, one of the richest agricultural regions in the world. That scheme received support from, among others, 80% of the affected farmers and the Socialist regional governments of regions such as [[Extremadura]], [[Andalusia]] or [[Castilla-La Mancha]]. Some Socialist politicians also supported it when they were members of the former Socialist government back in the 90s (e.g. [[José Borrell]], the current leader of the European Spanish Socialist Group and former president of the European Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertaddigital.com:83/php3/noticia.php3?fecha_edi_on=2004-08-26&amp;num_edi_on=1436&amp;cpn=1276231106&amp;seccion=SOC_D Libertad Digital: Sociedad :: '''INFORME:''' Los argumentos de Borrell contra las desaladoras]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was mainly opposed by Zapatero, [[environmentalist]] groups, the Socialist regional government of [[Aragon, Spain|Aragon]] and some of the citizens of the areas from which water was to be transferred. The main criticisms of the scheme were the supposed damage to the environment and an argued real lack of sufficient water for all of the affected parties (the proponents of the scheme answered back that there was no risk of a serious environmental damage and that in 2003, 14 times more water reached the sea than what was needed annually). (The scheme, finally approved by the Government, was canceled by Zapatero soon after becoming Prime Minister.)

Zapatero was the main proponent of the &quot;Pacto de las Libertades contra el Terrorismo&quot; (&quot;Anti Terrorist Freedom pact) which was signed on 8 December 2000. In the first moment this pact was disliked and rejected but later was considered a cornerstone of the strategy against Basque terrorism in Spain not only by the Socialist Party but by the People's Party (currently, it is considered broken by the People's Party). Zapatero's harsher critics have argued that the Pact was originated by the wish of the People's Party and the Socialist Party in order to bury the Socialist ambiguity towards nationalist parties caused by the Socialist Party's reliance on their votes.

At the end of the year, the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|Mad Cow disease]] came back into the spotlight after its outbreak in 1996. Zapatero repeatedly criticized the Government's management of the crisis arguing that it was out of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2001/01/09/sociedad/979051673.html |title=Zapatero propone 10 medidas para combatir el mal de las 'vacas locas' |publisher=Elmundo.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2005, that disease has caused dozens of deaths all over [[Europe]], though none in Spain.

In 2001 one of the biggest points of friction between the government and the opposition were the proposed reforms affecting the education system. The People's Party introduced the so-called LOU first, a law to change the University System, and later the LOCE (''Organic Act for Education Quality''), which affected Secondary Education. Zapatero strongly opposed both. The People's Party used its absolute majority in the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] to pass its reforms but after it had taken place an important number of protests by Student's Unions took place, which were featured prominently in the public media although their protests had usually passed unnoticed until Zapatero's arrival.

A regional election was held in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] on 13 May 2001. The socialists received 17.8 percent of the vote (against 17.6 percent in the previous 1998 elections) but lost one seat. Both, the Socialist Party and the People's Party had formed an alliance against the then ruling nationalist Basque political movements but the latter won again. The results were considered a failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicolás Redondo Terreros]], the Basque Socialist leader during the election who was strongly opposed to Basque nationalism and to [[ETA]], resigned after some internal clashes, resigning his seat in the Basque parliament and in the Federal Executive. He was replaced by [[Patxi López]], elected on 24 March 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patxi López]] had actively supported Zapatero during his campaign to become Secretary General. [OCAM p.&amp;nbsp;257]

On 21 October 2001 a new regional election took place, this time in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. The People's Party (led by [[Manuel Fraga Iribarne]]) obtained a new absolute majority. The Socialist party increased its number of seats from 15 to 17, but, after several years of opposition the results were also considered bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=321}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two negative results seemed to confirm that Zapatero's approach was not working.

On 19 December 2001 Zapatero travelled to [[Morocco]], after the Moroccan government expelled the Spanish ambassador [[sine die]]. [[Javier Arenas (Spanish politician)|Javier Arenas]], a prominent member of the People's Party, accusing him of not being loyal to Spanish interests. Zapatero denied it and claimed that one of his purposes was to help solve the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===From 2002 to 2003===
In 2002, Zapatero was chosen as the Socialist candidate for the next General Election. He was appointed directly, without a prior primary election {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}.

In 2002, the People's Party Government decided to reform the system of [[unemployment benefits]], as it thought that there were too many workers who being able to find a job preferred to continue receiving public money. This led to a redefinition of those who were eligible for unemployment benefits. Left-wing parties and [[trade union]]s considered that redefinition an unacceptable reduction of rights. Zapatero became the political leader of the opposition against the reform (dubbed the ''Decretazo'', because it was passed using a decree-law), which served him as his first important clash with Aznar's government.

A General Strike was announced for 20 June 2002 (the first since Aznar won the election in 1996). According to official data (including the electrical power consumption and the number of worked man-days calculated by the Social Security) the turnout was lower than 15 percent, the lowest since the restoration of democracy (there were four General Strikes during Felipe González' premiership). The unions and Zapatero disbelieved the data and considered the strike a resounding success, with more than &quot;10 million&quot; workers. Whatever the result, both the People's Party government and the trade unions signed an agreement that satisfied both parties in November.

In May 2002, Felipe González declared in reference to the change in the Socialist Party that &quot;My state of mind tells me that a change has taken place, that perhaps a second Suresnes {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} has happened, but it has yet to be proved that a new project with content and ideas really exists&quot;, thus doubting Zapatero's leadership. That declaration was expressed in a public event also attended by Zapatero, who calmly expressed his disagreement. González ended his intervention by remembering that his candidate for Secretary General was [[José Bono]], not Zapatero. González backtracked the next day, declaring that either his words had been incorrectly construed or he had expressed his ideas erroneously. José Bono himself confirmed his total support for Zapatero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=310–311}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident seemed to confirm that Zapatero's strategy was not working.

On 22 October 2002 Zapatero spoke in the name of the Socialist Party during the debate about the National Budget. Initially, [[Jordi Sevilla]] was to have been the Socialist spokesman but, at the last moment, he was replaced in a surprise move. When Jordi Sevilla, after being called by the speaker, had already descended to the floor of the Congress of Deputies, Zapatero said to him &quot;let me do it&quot; and climbed to the orator platform. José María Aznar and other members of the People's Party had previously criticized him for not representing his party in the debate, suggesting a lack of the necessary political skills. Zapatero tried to prove it was false, and it seems that his action had quite a positive effect on his supporters; although the People's Party considered his action too theatrical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2002, the oil tanker ''[[Prestige oil spill|Prestige]]'' suffered an accident in international waters{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} near [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] (a region in the Northwestern tip of Spain) that caused a grave oil slick which mainly affected Galicia, but also, to a lesser degree all the northern coast of Spain, and even the coast of France. The tanker was ordered by the governmental authorities to be moved away from the coast because it seems that the oil is easier to recover from the water than from the sand – for example, special ships already prepared for that exist – and increasing the distance increases the affected area but decreases the number of irremediably affected places. The ''Prestige'' finally split and sank.

Zapatero blamed the PP Government management during and after the accident&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2002/12/28/ciencia/1041089253.html |title=ciencia |publisher=elmundo.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the accident. The decision to take the tanker away was especially criticized as Zapatero expressed it to be unnecessary. Zapatero thought that it should have been allowed to enter a harbour.

The accident and its consequences became the main source of Socialist criticisms and the biggest point of friction, together with Iraq, until the election of 2004. A Socialist MP in the Regional Assembly of Madrid, Antonio Carmona, declared soon after the catastrophe: &quot;We have more than enough votes, if not, we will sink another boat&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plus.es/codigo/noticias/especiales/fichanoticia.asp?id=201242&amp;noti=202359 |title=cnn+ – La Tragedia del Prestige |publisher=Plus.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned because of this statement. [[Jesús Caldera]], who became a minister after the victory in 2004, was heavily criticized by the People's Party for using a manipulated document relative to the route of the ''Prestige'' in a parliamentary debate about the catastrophe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; These events were used by the People Party's &quot;to demonstrate&quot; the &quot;demagogical strategy&quot; of the Socialist Party.

Probably, the main point of friction between Aznar and Zapatero was the war in Iraq. Opinion polls showed that a clear majority of Spanish voters (around 90 percent) were against the U.S.-led attack against [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime. Among them, Zapatero who considered any action against Saddam's regime to be illegal and who was opposed to the very concept of [[preemptive war]].

On 26 May 2003 a [[Yakovlev Yak-42]] plane carrying Spanish soldiers coming home from [[Afghanistan]] crashed in [[Turkey]]. The plane had been hired by an agency of [[NATO]] and any other country could have used it. In Zapatero's view it presented clear dangers and he blamed Aznar and his government for neglecting aspects like the plane insurance or safety. Further, Aznar had rejected calls for a full inquiry into the crash.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsws&quot;&gt;[http://www.wsws.org/articles/2003/nov2003/crsh-n25.shtml Spain: &quot;Relatives of military plane crash victims met with official indifference&quot; by Keith Lee. 25 November 2003. World Socialist Web Site]. Retrieved 26 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2004 March elections it was proven that there had been serious irregularities when recognizing the bodies with an important number of mistakes in the identifications.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsws&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.el-mundo.es/documentos/2003/05/espana/accidente_ejercito/ |title=Documentos |publisher=Elmundo.Es |date=2003-05-26 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the [[European Constitution]], Zapatero criticized the People's Party Government for fighting to preserve the distribution of power agreed by the [[Nice]] treaty (December 2000) in the new European Constitution. Zapatero thought that Spain should accept a lesser share of power.

====2003 local elections====
{{BLP sources section|date=January 2009}}
On 25 May 2003, the first local and regional elections since Zapatero's appointment as leader of the Socialist party took place. The Socialist Party received a larger popular vote (which prompted Zapatero to claim his party had been the winner) but the People's Party obtained more posts in councils and regional governments. In general, there were not many changes in the results compared to those of the previous Elections held in 1999. The Socialists lost the [[Balearic Islands]] but got enough votes in [[Madrid]] to govern through a coalition with the communists of the [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]]. The last &quot;victory&quot; was welcomed by Zapatero as the winner in Madrid had always won the next general election. However, an unexpected scandal, the so-called Madrid Assembly Scandal, negatively affected the socialist expectations of a victory in 2004.

After the Madrid election, the People's Party lacked two seats to obtain an absolute majority. This seemed to allow an alliance of Socialists and the United Left to seize power. But an unexpected event happened. Eduardo Tamayo and María Teresa Sáez, two Socialist MPs angry at the distribution of power in the future regional government between the United Left and the Socialist Party started a crisis that led to a re-run of the Election in Madrid in October 2003 with the subsequent victory of the People's Party.

Zapatero did not accept the account of the Socialist MPs and tried to explain it as a conspiratorial plot caused by speculative interests of the house building industry that would have bribed the MPs to prevent a left-wing government.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The People's Party, on the other hand, defended the theory that the anger of the two Socialist MPs was caused by Zapatero's broken promise about the referred distribution of power within the Madrid section of the Socialist Party. That promise would have been made some months before the crisis in exchange of support for one of his more immediate collaborators ([[Trinidad Jiménez]]), who wanted to become the Socialist candidate for mayor of Madrid (the Spanish capital).

It was known that Eduardo Tamayo had played an active role in Zapatero's appointment as Secretary General of the party (See [[Zapatero's years as an opposition leader#Appointment as Secretary General]]), together with José Luis Balbás, the leader of the internal faction to which Eduardo Tamayo belonged, who was also expelled from the party because of the scandal.

Zapatero's team had entered into contact with José Luis Balbás through Enrique Martínez and [[Jesús Caldera]] (current Minister of Labor), who already knew him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2000, Zapatero, Caldera and José Blanco had had lunch with Eduardo Tamayo in a restaurant in Madrid. Tamayo would become later a representative of Zapatero in the 35th party national conference. At the end of the month &quot;Renovadores de la Base&quot; (the faction of Tamayo and Balbás) decided to support Zapatero and the later agreed to be part of Zapatero's team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=238–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played an important role during Zapatero's promotion. For example, Balbás together with [[José Blanco]] controlled the list of delegates. It was a fundamental job, as the different tasks of promotion needed that list, at least, to contact the delegates for the conference.

This was used by Zapatero's rivals to introduce doubts over Zapatero's leadership of the Socialist Party and over his honesty.

During the Debate over the State of the Nation, an annual debate that takes place every year in the [[Spanish Congress of Deputies]], Zapatero was harshly criticised by José María Aznar on account of the scandal. For the first time, the opinion polls showed that most Spaniards believed that the then Spanish Prime Minister had been the winner (Zapatero had always been considered the winner since his first debate in 2001).

The scandal was especially damaging for the Socialists because they had to overcome their reputation of being a corrupt party to again become the government of Spain. The two MP's rebellion seemed to prove they were unable to solve their old problems.

Later, in October, a regional election took place in Catalonia, whose results were worse than expected for the Socialist Party. All the [[Autonomous communities of Spain]] hold the elections to their assemblies the same day, with the exception of [[Andalusia]], [[Catalonia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]. That day coincides with the municipal elections all over Spain. Therefore, the results are hugely significant.

On 16 November 2003, the regional election for the [[Parliament of Catalonia|Assembly of Catalonia]] was held. Two days before, Zapatero had predicted a historic victory for the [[Socialists' Party of Catalonia]] and the beginning of the People's Party defeat. The Socialist Party won the election in popular vote but CiU obtained more MPs due to the electoral law. The final results were 46 seats for [[Convergence and Union]] (CiU) (ten fewer than in 1999, the year of the previous election), 42 for the Socialist Party (ten fewer), 15 for the People's Party (three more), 9 for [[Iniciativa per Catalunya-Verds]] and 23 (nine more) for the [[Republican Left of Catalonia]]. Zapatero attributed the bad results to the consequences of the crisis of Madrid. However, Maragall became the President of the Regional Government after a Pact with Republican Left of Catalonia and Iniciativa per Catalunya-Verds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That alliance resulted in another setback for the Socialist Party when the Spanish newspaper [[Diario ABC|ABC]] published an article stating that Josep-Lluís [[Carod-Rovira]], leader of Republican Left of Catalonia, had met some [[ETA]] members secretly in January 2004. According to ABC, Carod-Rovira had promised to provide ETA with political support if the group did not act in Catalonia, which seemed to have been confirmed by the ETA announcement of a truce affecting only that region some months later, before the general election of 2004. Carod-Rovira resigned as vice president of the Catalan government, but continued to be the leader of his party. The scandal damaged Zapatero's image, as ETA and political violence are controversial issues in Spain and Carod-Rovira's party was seen as a possible ally if Zapatero won the election.

At end of 2003 and the beginning of 2004 the Spanish political parties started to prepare themselves for the [[Spanish legislative election, 2004|general election of 2004]]. All of the opinion polls elaborated at the time foreseen a defeat for Zapatero, as they always predicted a new victory for the People's Party. (''See [[Zapatero and the 2004 General Election]]'')

==The 2004 general election==
===Election campaign===
The campaign for the General Election started a fortnight before 14 March 2004. Polls favoured the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]], with some polls predicting a possible repeat of their absolute majority.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

Previously, on 8 January 2004, Zapatero had created a Committee of Notables composed of 10 highly qualified experts with  considerable political weight. Its mission was to help him to become prime minister. Among its members: [[José Bono]] (his ex-rival for the Secretaryship of the party and later appointed Minister of Defence), [[Juan Carlos Rodríguez Ibarra]] (president of the regional government of [[Extremadura]] and one of the most important socialist leaders), [[Miguel Ángel Moratinos]] (his minister of Foreign affairs 2004–2010), [[Gregorio Peces-Barba]] (later appointed by him High Commissioner for the Victims of Terrorism, although he has already made public his resignation), [[Carmen Calvo]] (later appointed Minister of Culture), etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten days later, on 18 January 2004, Zapatero announced that he would only become prime minister if the Spanish Socialist Workers Party received a plurality, renouncing possible parliamentary alliances in advance if that situation did not happen after the election. Minority parties (especially [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]], a communist party) criticized the decision, for they considered it an attempt to attract their own voters, who would rather ensure a defeat of the People's Party even at the expense of voting for an unfavorable party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zapatero's slogan became &quot;we deserve a better Spain&quot;, which was coupled with &quot;Zapatero Presidente&quot;, or &quot;(ZP)&quot;, which itself has become a popular nickname of the current Spanish Prime Minister.

====Campaign promises====
* 180,000 new houses every year to buy or to rent
* Preservation of a balanced budget with no deficit but with a more flexible approach than that of the People's Party
* [[Bilingual education]] (English and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], together with the official regional language in the areas where it existed)
* A computer for every two students
* A two year maximum for legal processes or financial compensation
* Further investment in research and development
* Make the [[Televisión Española|state-owned television company]] more independent from the government by making its director answerable to parliament, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OCAM|pages=312}}&lt;/ref&gt;).{{Verify source|date=April 2007}}

During the campaign, Zapatero harshly criticized the People's Party for its management of the ''[[Prestige oil spill|Prestige]]'' crisis, its attitude towards the invasion of [[Iraq]] and the high cost of housing. [[Mariano Rajoy]], the new leader of the People's Party after [[José María Aznar|Aznar's]] voluntary retirement, on his part, attacked Zapatero's foreseeable future alliances with parties like United Left or Republican Left of Catalonia (a pro-Independence Catalan party).

One of the most important points of friction was the absence of televised debates between the candidates. Zapatero was the first to propose a debate to Mariano Rajoy. Rajoy accepted on the condition that Zapatero could not be alone but accompanied at least by two of his potential allies after the election: [[Gaspar Llamazares]] (the leader of United Left) and [[Josep-Lluís Carod-Rovira]] (leader of [[Republican Left of Catalonia]]). Rajoy justified his decision on the grounds that, in his opinion, he was not running against the Socialist Party but against a &quot;coalition&quot; of forces opposed to the People's Party's policies. Zapatero never formally responded to this proposal and throughout the campaign he continued criticizing what he always defined as Rajoy's reluctance to defend his political program face-to-face. (Zapatero has promised to change electoral law to make televised debates compulsory.)

===Madrid Bombings===
On 11 March 2004 the most deadly peacetime [[11 March 2004 Madrid attacks|attacks]] in Spanish history took place. Several commuter trains were bombed, causing 191 deaths and outrage all over Spain. The attacks took place three days before the General Election and all electoral activities were suspended. The common sorrow, instead of promoting unity among Spaniards, increased the already bitter tone of the campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Matthews |first=Owen |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6733216/site/newsweek/ |title=Reliving the Past - Newsweek: International Editions - MSNBC.com |publisher=MSNBC |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The People's Party government and Zapatero (who accused ETA in a radio statement broadcast at 8:50 a.m.), initially claimed the attacks to be the work of ETA, an armed [[Basque nationalism|Basque nationalist]] separatist organization. Later, after an audiotape in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] was found in a van near a railway station where the perpetrators boarded one of the trains, Aznar declared that all of the possibilities were being investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3504950.stm | work=BBC News | title=Spain casts wide net for bombers | date=12 March 2004 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government was accused of manipulating information about who was responsible for the attacks to avoid the consequences of public anger at a bombing motivated by its foreign policy – Aznar personally phoned the editors of the four national daily newspapers to tell them that ETA were responsible, whilst Minister of the Interior [[Ángel Acebes]] attacked those who believed that responsibility lay elsewhere, despite not offering any evidence for ETA's culpability,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2004/mar/15/comment.spain |title=Spun out of office |accessdate=4 August 2008|last=Mathieson |first=David|date=15 March 2004|publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the state broadcaster [[Televisión Española|TVE]] initially failed to report the protest outside the Popular Party's headquarters which ran through the night before the day of the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/mar/15/spain.angeliquechrisafis |title=Angry voters demand to know the truth behind carnage |accessdate=4 August 2008|last=Chrisafis |first=Angelique|date=15 March 2004|publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zapatero himself has repeatedly accused the Popular Party of lying about those who were responsible for the attacks. On the other hand, the book ''11-M. La venganza'' by Casimiro Abadillo, a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] journalist who works for the newspaper ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'', claims that, before the General Election, Zapatero had told that newspaper's director, Pedro J. Ramirez, that two [[suicide bombing|suicide bombers]] had been found among the victims (although the specialists that examined the bodies said they found no such evidence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.periodistadigital.com/object.php?o=31156 |title=Blogs |publisher=Periodista Digital |date=2008-10-22 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was asked in December 2004 about the issue by the Parliamentary Investigative Committee created to find the truth about the attacks, he declared that he did not remember what he had said.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

===Election day===

The campaign had ended abruptly two days before it was expected to convene as a result of the bombings. The day before the elections — in this case 13 March 2004 — is considered to be a &quot;Day of Reflection&quot; under Spanish electoral law, with candidates and their parties legally barred from political campaigning. Despite this prohibition, numerous demonstrations took place against the government of José María Aznar in front of the premises of the People's Party all over Spain. There were some claims that most of these demonstrations were instigated or orchestrated by the Socialist Party, through the use of SMS text messaging from mobile phones belonging to the Socialist Party. The Socialist Party publicly denied these accusations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

As the demonstrations escalated, Mariano Rajoy himself appeared on national TV to denounce the illegal demonstrations. In reply, both José Blanco and Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba broke the silence from the Socialist Party's side, in separate appearances. In the end both sides accused each other of breaking the electoral law on reflection day.

In this climate of social unrest and post-attack shock, the [[Spanish general election, 2004|elections]] were held on 14 March 2004. Zapatero's Socialist Party won the elections, with 164 seats in the Cortes, while the People's Party obtained 148. It seems likely that the election result was influenced to a greater or lesser extent by the Spanish public's response to the attacks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3506370.stm |title=Spain bombs 'to drive poll turnout' |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-03-14 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the informative coverage by the different media and political parties. He took office on 17 April.

===Influence of the attacks on the election outcome===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2010}}

An important point of controversy is if the purpose of the Madrid attacks were to force a Socialist victory; at issue as well was that, if that was the case, whether they succeeded in altering the final result. This has been called the &quot;4 March theory&quot; (that is, if the election had been scheduled for 7 March, the attacks would have taken place on 4 March) by Aznar, among others. No definitive data exists in favour of that possibility but some facts have been used to support it. Thus, the first question Jamal Zougam (one of the first arrested suspects) made when he arrived at the Courthouse on 15 March 2004 was: 'Who won the election?'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matthews |first=Owen |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4571262/site/newsweek/ |title=International Periscope &amp; Perspectives - Newsweek: International Editions - MSNBC.com |publisher=MSNBC |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How the bombing influenced the results is widely debated. The three schools of thought are:

* The attacks themselves might have changed the electoral winner. A sufficient number of voters suddenly decided to vote for the Socialist party because they thought that if it won, Islamist terrorism would be placated.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

* The handling of the attacks by the government, rather than the attacks themselves, might have changed the electoral winner. People who had the perception that the information about the attacks was being manipulated decided to vote the Socialist party as a response.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

* The attacks might have changed the result but not the winner. The Socialist Party was going to win but with fewer votes. (Despite this claim, most polls before the attacks gave a victory to [[Mariano Rajoy]].)

At least some of these controversies put a blemish on Zapatero's victory, as the shadow of what had happened the three previous days did not allow the Socialist Party to fully enjoy its triumph.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

The electoral result was considered by some foreign media,{{Which?|date=February 2009}} especially in the US, an example of weakness that would encourage further terrorist attacks,{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} as Zapatero had opposed [[George W. Bush]]'s policy in the [[Middle East]] and had promised to withdraw the Spanish troops from Iraq.

The theory that the bombing affected the result is a [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] that cannot be verified. As elections in European states hinge on social and economic policies mainly, it is equally possible the terrorist events had no notable effect. In this regard, a majority of 74%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup-international.com/ContentFiles/survey.asp?id=10 |title=Iraq Survey 2003 Results PDF (to download) |publisher=Gallup-international.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Spanish people were against Spanish involvement in the war.

On 13 June 2004 (three months after the General Election) the Election for the [[European Parliament]] took place. The Socialist Party tied with 25 seats vs 25 for the People's Party (out of 54), but narrowly won in popular vote. Although [[José Borrell]] was the official candidate, Zapatero played an important role in that campaign (as is usual in Spain).

His style's defining word is ''(buen) talante'', roughly &quot;pleasantness&quot;, &quot;niceness&quot; or &quot;good disposition&quot;, which is in brisk and carefully chosen contrast with the more confrontational and brusque premiership style of previous Prime Minister [[José María Aznar]]. Similarly, Zapatero has been quoted to shy away from adopting unpopular measures, having a &quot;habit of showering public money on any problem&quot; and, in all, being &quot;averse to tough decisions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14130653 |title=Premium content |publisher=Economist.com |date=2009-07-30 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Withdrawal from Iraq===
One of the first measures he carried out as soon as he took office was to withdraw every Spanish soldier fighting in Iraq, which he did in less than a month. This drew criticism from the right, who held the view that he was ceding to the pressure of the terrorists who attacked Spain. However, it was a measure announced by him before the general elections and supported by the majority of Spanish population.

===Domestic policy===
Much of Zapatero's work has been on social issues, including [[gender]]-motivated violence and discrimination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universia.es/portada/actualidad/noticia_actualidad.jsp?noticia=73446 |title=Hoy-Aprueba-Ley-Violencia-Genero |publisher=Universia.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[divorce]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/07/09/espana/1120903826.html |title=La ley del divorcio entra en vigor hoy tras ser publicada ayer en el BOE – españa |publisher=elmundo.es |date=2005-06-30 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/04/21/espana/1114087944.html |title=El Congreso aprueba el matrimonio entre personas del mismo sexo |publisher=elmundo.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent social issue tackled has been the Dependency Law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=20minutos.es. 20.04.2006 – 11.21 h |url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/111088/0/ministros/ley/dependencia/ |title=Unos 12.000 millones de euros en ayudas para más de un millón de personas dependientes |publisher=20minutos.es |date=2006-04-20 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; a plan to regulate help and resources for people in dire need of them, and who cannot provide for themselves and must rely on others on a daily basis. Zapatero has also made it clear that he values funding of research and development and higher education and believes them to be essential for Spain's economic competitiveness. At the same time, he has increased the [[minimum wage]] and pursued other classically socialist policies. He has also announced his intention to undertake limited reforms to the [[Spanish Constitution]], though no specifics have been made available.

===Economic problems===
Facing a recession and rising unemployment, ZP pledged to cut government spending by 4.5% and raise taxes, but not income taxes.  The Popular Party contends that ZP lacked a coherent economic plan and stated &quot;There is no tax increase capable of filling the hole that you have created,&quot;. On June 23, 2008 Zapatero announced 21 reforms designed to aid economic recovery in a speech pointedly avoiding popular terms of the period such as 'crisis'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wikileaks.ch/cable/2008/06/08MADRID707.html |title=ZAPATERO ANNOUNCES MEASURES TO ADDRESS ECONOMIC SITUATION, REACTION SKEPTICAL |date=2008-06-25 |accessdate=2010-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although government deficits are projected to increase to 10% of GDP, ZP promises to reduce it to 3% required by EU policy by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Catan |first=Thomas |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125249000052995119.html |title=Spain Raises Taxes as Budget Crisis Deepens - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2009-09-10 |accessdate=2010-06-04}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011 Spain's Unemployment Rate had risen to 20.33% exceeding Prime Minister Zapatero's target rate of 19.4 percent.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110128/bs_afp/spaineconomyunemployment_20110128120624&lt;/ref&gt;

===LGBT rights===

The legalization of [[same-sex marriage in Spain]] on 1 July 2005 includes [[LGBT adoption|adoption rights]] as well as other rights that were previously only available to [[heterosexual]] couples. This caused a stir within the [[Catholic Church]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4473001.stm | work=BBC News | title=Vatican condemns Spain gay bill | date=22 April 2005 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which opposed the measures and supported a demonstration attended by some 166,000 (according to official figures) and one million people (according to the organisers) in [[Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=20 minutos.es. 19.06.2005 – 01.17 h |url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/32519/0/manifestacion/matrimonio/homosexual |title=manifestación contra matrimonio gay |publisher=20minutos.es |date=2005-06-19 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Zapatero's government was also responsible for a Gender Identity Law that allows [[transsexual]] persons the right to have their identity legally recognised, the criteria being one clinical evaluation and two years of treatment (generally hormone replacement therapy), and without demanding mandatory genital surgery or irreversible sterility.  The law is, alongside with the legislation of some US states, one of the most simple and non-bureaucratic that currently exist in the world.  Transsexual persons also have the right to marry persons of the opposite or same sex they have transitioned into, and to biologically parent children either before or after transitioning.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Regional territorial tensions===

Zapatero has often declared that his government will not be &quot;soft on terrorism&quot; and will not allow regional nationalists to endanger Spanish unity. Some say{{Who|date=March 2009}} that this comment was probably made for his party alliances with parties like [[Republican Left of Catalonia]].

On 13 November 2003 in a rally in [[Barcelona]] during the election campaign that took [[Pasqual Maragall]] to power in the [[Generalitat]], Rodríguez Zapatero gave a famous promise to approve the [[Statute of Catalonia]]:
:''I will support the reform of the Statute of Catalonia that the Parliament of Catalonia approves.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquerra.org/nouestatut/videozp.php?s=2 |title=L'Estatut Sencer. Cap Retallada A Madrid! |publisher=Esquerra.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2005, a controversial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barcelonareporter.com/index.php?/comments/erc_form_roadblock_on_path_to_catalan_statute_reform/ |title=ERC form roadblock on path to Catalan statute reform |accessdate=4 August 2008|date=21 March 2006|publisher=[[El País]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposal to reform the Catalan statute arrived at the Spanish parliament after being passed in Catalonia. Zapatero, who had often expressed his support for a change of the statute (although he did not entirely support the draft passed by the Catalan Parliament), supported the reform.

===Spanish Civil War remnants===

In October 2004 Zapatero's government undertook the task of morally and legally rehabilitating those who were suppressed during and after the [[Spanish Civil War]], by instituting a Memorial Commission chaired by Vice-Prime Minister [[María Teresa Fernández de la Vega]].

On 17 March 2005, Zapatero's government ordered the removal of the last remaining statue of former [[dictator]] [[Francisco Franco]] that remained in Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/03/17/madrid/1111018865.html |title=El Gobierno retira la estatua de Franco en Nuevos Ministerios |publisher=elmundo.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reform of the education system===
{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}
Just after he took office, Zapatero repealed the law reforming the Education System passed by the previous government and, in November 2005, introduced his own reform bill. The bill was opposed by the People's Party, the Catholic Church, the [[Muslim]] community, The Catholic Confederation of [[Parent]]s' Associations and an important part of the educational community, often for disparate reasons. Complaints against the reform include the limits it imposes upon parents' freedom to choose a school, the decrease in academic status of voluntary religious education, the introduction of a compulsory course (&quot;[[Education for Citizenship (Spain)|Education for Citizenship]]&quot;) and a perceived ineffectiveness of the reform in terms of combating poor educational results. The last complaint would be reinforced by the opinion that Spain has ranked poorly amongst the developed countries in the quality and results of its education.

After a major demonstration took place against this education reform, the government held a series of meetings with many of the organizations that opposed the reform, reaching agreements with some of them (especially parents' associations and teachers' unions). Some others, most prominently the People's Party and the Catholic Church remain staunchly opposed to it.

===ETA===

{{Main|ETA's 2006 &quot;permanent ceasefire&quot;}}

[[ETA]] declared what it described at the time as a &quot;permanent [[ceasefire]]&quot; that began on midnight 23 March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/ETA/declara/alto/fuego/permanente/elpporesp/20060322elpepunac_3/Tes |title=ETA declara un alto el fuego permanente · ELPAÍS.com |publisher=Elpais.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 5 June 2007 ETA declared this ceasefire over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jason Webb |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSL0526292220070605 |title=Basque rebels ETA say ending Spanish ceasefire &amp;#124; U.S. |publisher=Reuters |date= 5 June 2007|accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the initial ceasefire declaration Zapatero informed the Congress that steps would be taken to negotiate with ETA in order to end its terrorist campaign while denying that there would be any political price paid to put an end to ETA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/06/29/espana/1151579293.html |title=Zapatero anuncia el inicio del diálogo con ETA |publisher=elmundo.es |date=2006-06-29 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PP grew concerned about the possibility of political concessions being made to the group to stop their ways, and actively opposed anything other than the possibility of an organized surrender and dismantling of ETA, refusing to support any kind of negotiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/06/29/espana/1151583675.html |title=Unos contactos sin el respaldo del PP |publisher=elmundo.es |date=2006-06-29 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 December 2006 the ceasefire was broken when a car bomb exploded in [[2006 Madrid Barajas International Airport bombing|Madrid's International Airport, Barajas]] and ETA claimed authorship. Following this, Zapatero gave orders to halt initiatives leading to negotiations with ETA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Zapatero/He/ordenado/suspender/todas/iniciativas/desarrollar/dialogo/ETA/elpepuesp/20061230elpepunac_4/Tes |title=Zapatero: &quot;He ordenado suspender todas las iniciativas para desarrollar el diálogo con ETA&quot; · ELPAÍS.com |publisher=Elpais.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrations across Spain followed the next day, most condemning the attack, others condemning the Government's policies and a minority even questioning the authorship of the Madrid bombings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/12/30/espana/1167494632.html |title=Miles de ciudadanos muestran su rechazo a ETA y a la política del Gobierno |publisher=elmundo.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A massive rally in Madrid followed on 25 February 2007 promoted by the Victims of Terrorism Association (AVT in Spanish acronym), rejecting what are perceived to be concessions from the government to the separatists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5068616.stm | work=BBC News | title=Don't surrender to Eta, protesters say | date=11 June 2006 | accessdate=7 May 2010 | first=Danny | last=Wood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 March 2007 a new massive rally was held in Madrid gathering -depending on the source's relationships to the government-  between 342,000 and over two million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2007/03/10/espana/1173524078.html?a=6f03dc6c2fb364817ee69020399bc9f2&amp;t=1173591131 |title=Rajoy llama a 'defender España' ante cientos de miles de personas en Madrid |publisher=elmundo.es |date=2006-11-22 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstration was organized by the opposition party PP and backed by the AVT and several other associations of victims, to not allow [[Iñaki de Juana Chaos]] out of prison and accusing Zapatero's government of surrendering to terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6438623.stm | work=BBC News | title=Madrid rally over ETA man release | date=10 March 2007 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration===

During the meeting of the European Union Justice and Home Affairs Ministers held in [[Tampere]] on 22 September 2006, some of the European ministers reprimanded the Spanish authorities for the aforementioned massive regularisation of undocumented immigrants which was regarded as too loose and opposed to the policies of other State members (on 2 September and 3 alone, during the height of the last illegal immigration wave, 2,283 people arrived illegally in the [[Canary Islands]] having shipped from [[Senegal]] aboard 27 [[pirogue]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/09/21/espana/1158825738.html |title='España no se va a hundir por 25.000 inmigrantes; en Alemania lo solucionamos nosotros mismos' |publisher=elmundo.es |date=2006-09-21 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.es/articulo/espana/Alonso/opuso/Gobierno/Armada/interceptara/barcas/inmigrantes/elpporesp/20061009elpepinac_4/Tes/ |title=El País, 9 October 2006, in Spanish |publisher=Elpais.es |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once they reach Spanish territory, the undocumented immigrants can travel freely -for the internal frontiers are basically open within the [[European Union]] (with the exception of the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]] who maintain full border controls); thus, it is not unknown for some of them have other European countries as their final destinations. This started a short lived polemic between France's [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] and the Spanish premier Rodríguez Zapatero.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertaddigital.com:83/php3/opi_desa.php3?fecha_edi_on=2006-10-01&amp;num_edi_on=1457&amp;cpn=33602&amp;tipo=&amp;seccion=OPI_D Libertad Digital – EDITORIAL – Zapatero, Sarkozy y la inmigración]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadenaser.com/articulo/espana/Zapatero/Sarkozy/dan/superada/polemica/politica/inmigracion/csrcsrpor/20060930csrcsrnac_1/Tes/ |title=Zapatero y Sarkozy dan por superada su polémica sobre política de inmigración en |publisher=Cadenaser.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lavanguardia.es/gen/20060929/51285375563/noticias/sarkozy-replica-a-zapatero-no-doy-lecciones-a-nadie-ni-tampoco-me-gusta-que-me-las-den-francia-madrid-miguel-angel-moratinos-teresa-fernandez-waldner.html ]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of foreign policy action==
===Iraq===
Before being elected, Zapatero opposed the American policy in regard to [[Iraq]] pursued by former Spanish Prime Minister Aznar. During the electoral campaign Zapatero had promised to withdraw the troops if control in Iraq was not passed to the [[United Nations]] after 30 June (the ending date of the initial Spanish military agreement with the multinational coalition that had overthrown Saddam Hussein). Zapatero declared that he did not intend to withdraw the Spanish troops before that date after being questioned about the issue by the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party's]] leader [[Mariano Rajoy]] in his inauguration parliamentary debate as Prime Minister.

On 19 April 2004 Zapatero announced the withdrawal of the 1,300 Spanish troops in [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2004/04/18/espana/1082303152.html |title=Zapatero anuncia la retirada inmediata de las tropas de Irak |publisher=elmundo.es |date=2004-03-30 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision aroused international support worldwide, though the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] claimed that terrorists could perceive it as &quot;a victory obtained due to the [[11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings]]&quot;. [[John Kerry]], then [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic party]] candidate for the U.S. Presidency, asked Zapatero not to withdraw the Spanish soldiers. Some months after withdrawing the troops, the Zapatero government agreed to increase the number of Spanish soldiers in [[Afghanistan]] and to send troops to [[Haiti]] to show the Spanish Government's willingness to spend resources on international missions approved by the [[United Nations]].

On 8 June 2004, with the withdrawal already complete, Zapatero's government voted in the [[United Nations Security Council]] in favour of Resolution 1546 where the following could be read:

:&quot;''The Security Council, Recognising the importance of international support [...] for the [[Iraqi people|people of Iraq]] [...], Affirming the importance of international assistance in reconstruction and development of the Iraqi economy [...]''

:''15. Requests Member States and international and regional organizations to contribute assistance to the multinational force, including '''military forces''', as agreed with the Government of Iraq, to help meet the needs of the Iraqi people for security and stability, humanitarian and reconstruction assistance, and to support the efforts of UNAMI;''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2004/sc8117.doc.htm |title=SECURITY COUNCIL ENDORSES FORMATION OF SOVEREIGN INTERIM GOVERNMENT IN IRAQ; WELCOMES END OF OCCUPATION BY 30 JUNE, DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS BY JANUARY 2005 |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin America===
{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}
{{See also|¿Por qué no te callas?}}
An important change in Spanish foreign policy was Zapatero's decision to approach left-wing leaders such as [[Cuba]]'s [[Fidel Castro]] and [[Venezuela]]'s [[Hugo Chávez]]. Zapatero has played an important role in the improvement of the relationship between the Cuban government and the [[European Union]].

At the end of March 2005, Zapatero travelled to Venezuela to sign a deal to sell military ships and aircraft to Venezuela worth around [[US$]]1 billion. The US government attempted to intervene but failed, accusing Venezuela of being a &quot;dangerous country.&quot;

After the election of [[Evo Morales]] in [[Bolivia]], Spain was one of the countries the new president visited during his first international tour.

At the 2007 Ibero-American Summit, Chávez called Zapatero's predecessor [[José María Aznar]] a [[fascist]] for allegedly supporting the 2002 coup attempt. Zapatero used his speaking time to defend Aznar, noting that he was &quot;democratically elected by the Spanish people.&quot; Chávez kept trying to interrupt Zapatero, even as summit organisers turned off his microphone. [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos]], who was seated beside Zapatero, attempted to rebuke Chávez, but was stopped by Zapatero who, displaying significant patience, told him to wait a moment. When Chávez continued to interrupt Zapatero, Juan Carlos, in a rare outburst of anger, asked Chávez &quot;[[¿Por qué no te callas?]]&quot; (Why don't you shut up?). The king left the hall shortly afterwards when the [[President of Nicaragua]] began to criticize the Spanish government as well. Zapatero continued to participate in the negotiations, later delivering, to loud applause, a speech demanding respect for the leaders of other countries.

===United States===
The relations between José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero and former U.S. president [[George W. Bush]] were difficult, mostly as a result of Zapatero's opposition to the war in Iraq.

On 12 October 2003, during the [[Fiesta Nacional de España]] military parade held in Madrid, then [[opposition leader]] and presidential candidate Zapatero remained seated as a [[U.S. Marine Corps]] honour guard carrying the [[American flag]] walked past Zapatero and other VIPs. Everybody else stood as with the rest of the foreign guest armies representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.flickr.com/6/9292746_65f56a3c38_o.jpg |title=Zapatero (right, bottom) seated during the Fiesta Nacional's military parade in 2003 as the Stars and Stripes marched |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He declared afterwards that his action was a protest against the war and certainly not intended as an insult to the American people.

Later on, during an official visit to Tunisia shortly after Zapatero was elected, he asked all of the countries with troops in Iraq to withdraw their soldiers. This declaration moved Bush to send a letter expressing discontent to the Spanish premier.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

American troops were subsequently instructed to not take part during the traditional military parade on the Spanish national holiday in 2004 and in 2005, something which they used to, as both the Spanish and American armies –being [[NATO]] allies– are part of joint humanitarian missions; American troops returned to the military parade in 2006; this time Zapatero, being the Spanish premier, stood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/desfile/Dia/Fiesta/Nacional/rinde/homenaje/misiones/internacionales/elpporesp/20061012elpepunac_4/Tes |title=El desfile del Día de la Fiesta Nacional rinde homenaje a las misiones internacionales · ELPAÍS.com |publisher=Elpais.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zapatero publicly stated his support for [[John Kerry]] as a candidate running in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|U.S. Presidential election in 2004]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,114568,00.html |title=Kerry Rejects Foreign Endorsement – You Decide 2004 |publisher=FOXNews.com |date=2004-03-19 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the election took place, winner George W. Bush did not return Zapatero's congratulation phone call, though the [[White House]] firmly denied that Bush's intention was to snub the Spanish prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,11069-1354071,00.html | work=The Times | location=London | title=The President is too busy to call Spain told | first1=Roland | last1=Watson | first2=Edward | last2=Owen | date=11 November 2004 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile Zapatero repeatedly insisted that Spain's relations with the United States were good. In spite of that, Zapatero acknowledged years after that the phone conversation held with President George W. Bush was &quot;unforgettable&quot; and that when told that the Spanish troops were leaving Iraq, the American president had told him &quot;I am very disappointed in you&quot; and that the conversation ended in a &quot;very cold&quot; manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;hastalavista&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/opinion/09Cohen.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin &quot;Hasta la Vista, Baby&quot; by Roger Cohen. ''The New York Times''. Published: 8 October 2008 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Zapatero later told a ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter off the record that he had a “certain consideration” for Bush, because “I recognise that my electoral success has been influenced by his governing style&quot;. i.e. that Bush was so unpopular in Spain that he helped Zapatero win in 2004 and 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;hastalavista&quot;/&gt;

In March 2009, Spain announced that it would withdraw its forces from [[Kosovo Force|Kosovo]]. [[State Department|US State Department]] spokesman Robert Wood issued unusually strong criticism by stating that the United States was &quot;deeply disappointed&quot; by the decision. He said that Washington only learned of the move shortly before Spain announced it publicly. Spanish Defense Minister [[Carme Chacon]] made the announcement saying, &quot;The mission has been completed and it is time to return home.&quot; Asked if the United States shared that assessment, Wood said, &quot;Not at all.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iht.com/articles/ap/2009/03/20/business/US-Spain-Kosovo.php |title=Search – Global Edition – The New York Times |publisher=International Herald Tribune |date=2009-03-29 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]] stated that the American relationship with Spain goes beyond &quot;whatever disagreement we may have over Kosovo&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/28/AR2009032801352.html | work=The Washington Post}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}

Zapatero's predecessor, [[José María Aznar]], defended a strong [[Atlanticist]] policy. Zapatero has downplayed that policy in favour of a [[Pro-Europeanism|pan-European]] one. He has also sponsored the idea of an [[Alliance of Civilizations]] which is co-sponsored by [[Prime Minister of Turkey|Turkish Prime Minister]] [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]].

In the writing of what was to be the [[European Constitution]] Zapatero accepted the distribution of power proposed by countries such as [[Germany]] and [[France]]. After signing the treaty in [[Rome]] together with other leaders, he decided to call for a [[referendum]], which was held on 20 February 2005. It was the first referendum on the EU treaty, a fact highly publicized by Zapatero's government. A 'Yes' vote was supported by the Socialist Party and the People's Party and as a result almost 77 percent voted in favour of the European Constitution, but turnout was around 43 percent. However, this result came to nothing when a referendum in France voted to reject the European Constitution which meant that the EU could not ratify the treaty because support was not unanimous.

====Presidency of the Council of the European Union====
On 1 January 2010, Spain assumed the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency]] of the [[European Union]] for the first six months of the 18 month 'Trio' along with [[Belgium]] and [[Hungary]]. The development of the Stockholm Programme Action Plan, the impulse for the EU adhesion to the European Convention on Human Rights, the setting up of the new plan for effective equality between women and men, and the political decision to promote the European protection order, were all important advances achieved under the Spanish Presidency.

Within days, Spain's web site for its Presidency www.eu2010.es was defaced by a picture of the main character of a popular television show, [[Mr. Bean]], the supposed lookalike of Zapatero&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2010/01/04/union_europea/1262634659.html Un error de principiantes permitió el 'ataque' a la web de la presidencia]'' (A beginner's error allowed the attack on the website of the presidency); print title:Mr. Bean inaugura el semestre español (Mr Bean inaugurates the Spanish semester), [[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]], 4 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; although the [[Cross-site scripting|XSS]] attack lasted only several hours.

===France and Germany===

On 1 March 2005, Zapatero became the first Spanish prime minister to speak to the French National Assembly. He supported the PS candidate [[Ségolène Royal]] during her campaign for the [[2007 French presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2007/04/20/videos/1177061368.html |title=Zapatero apoya a Ségolène en Toulouse &amp;#124; elmundo.es videos |publisher=Elmundo.es |date=2007-04-20 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zapatero directly supported the SPD candidate, Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]], before the [[German federal election, 2005|German election of 18 September 2005]].

===Gibraltar===
{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}
While Zapatero complained about [[Gibraltar]]'s celebrations for the tercentenary of British rule and rejected the Gibraltarians' requests for Spain to recognise their right to self-determination, at the end of 2004 his policy changed and he became the first Spanish prime minister to accept the participation of [[Gibraltar]] as a partner on the same level as [[Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in discussions both countries hold regularly concerning the territory. The decision was criticized by many in Spain as a surrender of their claim to sovereignty over Gibraltar as well as an alleged disruption of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. Zapatero said it was a new way to solve a 300-year-old issue.

==2008 election==

'''José María Alfredo Aznar López''' ({{IPA-es|xoˈse maˈɾia aθˈnar|-|Es-José_María_Aznar.ogg}}; born 25 February 1953) served as the [[Prime Minister of Spain]] from 1996 to 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=2004|url=http://www.cidob.org/es/documentacion/biografias_lideres_politicos/europa/espana/jose_maria_aznar_lopez|title=Extended biography at Fundación CIDOB {{es icon}}|publisher=Fundació CIDOB|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Manuel Vázquez Montalbán|MONTALBÁN, M.V.]] ''La Aznaridad'', 4th ed. Mondadori (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; He is on the board of directors of [[News Corporation]].

==Early life==

Aznar, born in [[Madrid]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/Diputados/BusqForm?_piref73_1333155_73_1333154_1333154.next_page=/wc/fichaDiputado&amp;idDiputado=189&amp;idLegislatura=7 Biography at Spanish congress site]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1953, was the son of [[Manuel Aznar Acedo]], army official, journalist and radio broadcaster, and grandson of [[Manuel Aznar Zubigaray]], a prominent journalist during the [[Franco era]]. Both father and grandfather held governmental positions during the years of [[Spain under Franco]]. He studied law at the [[Complutense University of Madrid]], graduating in 1975, becoming a Spanish Tax Authority inspector in 1976.

==Politician==
As a teenager, Aznar was a member of the ''Frente de Estudiantes Sindicalistas'' (FES), a [[Student Union]] supporting the [[Falange]], Franco's one-party [[fascist]] organization. After 1977 it would become ''[[Falange Española Independiente]]'' (FEI).&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.us.archive.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=1969 |url=http://www.archive.org/download/Carta_Aznar_revistaSP_1969/Carta_Aznar_revistaSP_1969.pdf |title=A letter written by Jose María Aznar in 1969 to the editor of a falangist journal |publisher=http://www.us.archive.org/ |accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the death of [[Francisco Franco]] and the restoration of [[Spanish transition to democracy|democracy]], Aznar joined ''[[People's Alliance (Spain)|Alianza Popular]]'' (AP) in January 1979, a few months after his wife. In March he became the Secretary General of the party in [[La Rioja (autonomous community)|La Rioja]], occupying the post until 1980. In February 1981 he joined the AP's National executive committee. He became Assistant Secretary General in February 1982. 

On 26 October 1982 he was elected to the [[Parliament]], representing [[Ávila (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Ávila]]. On 22 June 1985 he was elected to the presidency of the AP in [[Castile and León]]. On 2 December 1986 AP leader [[Manuel Fraga]] resigned following fierce internal party fighting in the aftermath of another failure to dislodge the ruling [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE). Aznar was not considered senior enough to be a possible successor, and gave his support to the more conservative Miguel Herrero, who lost the leadership battle to Fraga's choice, [[Antonio Hernández Mancha]]. As a result, Aznar lost his post as Assistant Secretary General. 

On 10 June 1987, having resigned his parliamentary seat, he was elected to the [[parliament|Cortes]] of [[Castile-León]], where he was elected president of this Autonomous Region. Two years later, Aznar was voted by the National Executive Committee to be the new leader of his party, re-founded as the ''Partido Popular'' ([[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]], or PP).  With Fraga focused on the presidency of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], Aznar was confirmed as leader of the PP at their 10th National Congress at the end of March 1990. In November the PP moved from the Conservative group in the [[European Parliament]] to the more centrist and [[Christian Democrat]]ic [[European People's Party]].  

On 6 June 1993 the PP again lost the general election, but improved on their previous performance by obtaining 34.8% of the vote. The PSOE lost its absolute majority and needed to form a coalition government with other parties in order to continue governing. The result was a disappointment for the PP as the opinion polls had predicted a victory for them.  They did well in the 1994 European and 1995 local elections.

On 19 April 1995, Aznar's armored car prevented him from being assassinated by an [[ETA]] bomb.

The PP won the 3 March 1996 [[Spanish legislative election, 1996|general election]] with 37.6% of the vote, thus ending 13 years of PSOE rule. With 156 of the 350 seats (the PSOE won 141) Aznar had to reach agreements with two regional nationalist parties, [[Convergence and Unity]] (Catalan) and the [[Canary Islands Coalition]], in order to govern with additional support from the [[Basque Nationalist Party]]. He was voted in as President with 181 votes in the [[Cortes Generales]] on 4 May and sworn in the next day by King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]].

==Aznar's terms==
{{ref improve section|date=May 2011}}

===First term (1996–2000)===
The Aznar Government maintained the commitment of the previous government to join the [[Euro|European Union's single currency]] and showed itself willing to take political risks in order to meet the requirements for membership. In the summer of 1996 it announced a decision to freeze the wages of [[civil servants]] in the following year and stood by that decision throughout the fall, despite a series of union-led demonstrations that culminated in protest marches by tens of thousands of Spaniards throughout the nation on 11 December.

The Government, with the backing of regional nationalist parties, passed a strict 1997 budget on 27 December, four days before time would have run out for its approval. The opposition [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]] coalition argued that the spending cuts and tax adjustments contained in the budget would hurt the disadvantaged and benefit the rich. The budget aimed to enable Spain to lower its deficit to below 3% of [[gross domestic product]], a requirement for joining the EU's single currency. Some critics note that this wasn't the only way of doing so.

The Government was also forced to back down on a plan to reduce Spanish dependence on its own high-priced coal when hundreds of coal miners blocked highways and demonstrated in November. The miners persuaded the government to adjust a national electricity plan that would have phased out the subsidy of Spanish coal, making it more expensive than imported coal.

Aznar also announced the sale early in 1997 of the nation's remaining minority stake ([[Golden Share|golden shares]]) in the [[Telefónica]] telecommunications company and the petroleum group [[Repsol YPF|Repsol]]. These golden shares in Telefonica and Repsol YPF, as well as in [[Endesa (Spain)|Endesa]], [[Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria|Argentaria]] and [[Tabacalera]], all presided over by people close to Aznar, have since been declared illegal by the European Union. This marked the beginning of a period of privatizations after the previous PSOE government had nationalized parts of the economy.

After the PP's first year in office, the goodwill between it and the major nationalist parties in the legislature, Convergence and Unity (CiU) and the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), appeared to have lost strength. Both parties had enjoyed leverage over the previous PSOE government, and the PNV in particular stepped back from colluding too closely with the government.

[[Ecological]] issues came to the fore in Spain during 1998. A vigorous public debate created a new awareness of topics such as environmental pollution and deforestation, and a host of organizations competed to spread the ecological message. The Government, conscious of the political implications of this new concern, was also party to the debate and promised active cooperation. As a reaction against attempts to liberalize the current abortion laws, Roman Catholic groups renewed their anti-abortion campaigns.

The economy suffered the effects of the global recession unleashed by the financial crisis in Asia, and the Economic Ministry reduced its 1999 economic growth estimate from 3.9% to 3.7%. The sharp decline in share prices on the Madrid and Barcelona stock exchanges (on average about 20%) created cause for concern among both business associations and trade unions. The latter voiced their concern about the risk of increased [[unemployment]], which remained around 12.5%. Despite this slowdown, salaries increased by an average of 2.3% that year.

In 1999, the [[European Union]] introduced the euro, a major success for Aznar and his government. Steady economic growth and falling unemployment, though the rate exceeded all other EU member states, won the government public support. The Government's credibility was damaged when the PSOE revealed at the end of the year that the ranks of top Spanish civil servants had increased 15% over the previous year despite PP promises to cut the bureaucracy.

===Second term (2000–2004)===
[[Image:Bush, Barroso, Blair, Aznar at Azores.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|[[José Manuel Barroso|Barroso]], [[Tony Blair|Blair]], [[George W. Bush|Bush]], and Aznar in the [[Azores]]]]
Spanish voters reelected Aznar in the [[Spanish general election, 2000|2000 general election]] with an outright majority. The PP obtained 44.5% of the vote and 183 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=2000|url=http://electionresources.org/es/congress.php?election=2000|title=Elections to the Spanish Congress of Deputies - Results Lookup|publisher=Election Resources on the Internet|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish electorate's participation was the lowest for a general election in Spain in the post-Franco era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=2004|url=http://electionresources.org/es/index_en.html|title=Elections to the Spanish Congress of Deputies|publisher=Election Resources on the Internet|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain was one of the fastest-growing economies in the [[European Union]] (EU) in 2001, despite inflation nearing 4% and signs of an economic slowdown.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} However, the government's problems involved politics as much as policies. A number of issues were handled clumsily, including implementation of immigration legislation passed in January and a health scare over low-quality olive oil in July. In the autumn complaints that the government was steamrolling controversial university reforms through the parliament inflamed the opposition. 

At the end of the year, students all over the country joined in strikes, demonstrations, and sit-ins, often alongside their rectors and professors. Though still outperforming most of its EU partners, Spain failed to escape the effects of the global economic downturn in 2002. Falling exports, declining domestic consumption, and a sharp drop in tourist revenue helped bring annual gross domestic product growth down to an estimated 2%, the lowest level since 1996.

In addition, rising crime rates and soaring house prices (up almost 50% since 1998) were the object of widespread public concern, providing opposition parties with powerful ammunition against Aznar's government.

The government ran into even deeper trouble in its attempt to reform the [[unemployment benefit]] system. A controversial decree-law issued on 27 May introduced new restrictions on entitlement to benefits, making it harder for those receiving welfare to turn down jobs offered by the public employment agency, and phasing out the special subsidy for agricultural workers in the south. The trade unions reacted by calling a 24-hour [[general strike]] on 20 June, embarrassing the government on the eve of an EU summit in [[Seville]]. The stoppage proved a largely unexpected success. On 7 October, just two days after a major national demonstration in Madrid to protest against the law, new Labor Minister Eduardo Zaplana announced an abrupt U-turn, accepting nearly all of the unions' demands and leaving only the reform of the subsidy for farm laborers on the statute book.

A major secondary-education bill also proved controversial. Intended to raise educational standards, the proposed Law of Quality lowered the age at which students were streamed into different educational tracks, allowed special schools in the state sector to select on merit, and introduced a new secondary-school-leaving exam. Opposition to the bill's potential socially divisive effects and inadequate funding for the public educational system brought student organizations, trade unions, and left-wing parties into the streets as the bill was being debated in the parliament in October.

Amid the relatively stagnant European economies, estimated GDP growth of 2.3% made Spain the second fastest-growing economy in the European Union in 2003. Continued expansion enabled the Spanish government to proclaim proudly that it would end the year with a budget surplus for the first time in recent history. However; inflation was running at 2.7% (compared with the EU's 1.7%) in November, unemployment stood at more than 10%, almost one-third of the workforce had temporary contracts, and housing prices were spiraling. The European Commission shared analysts' concerns that a hike in interest rates or increased unemployment could send housing prices tumbling, with disastrous consequences for families burdened with unprecedented levels of debt and for the financial institutions that had given them loans.

After six years of relative political calm, when political debate was dominated by a consensus within the ruling party on economics, regional nationalism, and terrorism, several issues arose which polarized Spanish public opinion. Like UK Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], Aznar actively supported the United States' [[War on Terrorism]], despite public opposition. Aznar met with Bush in a private meeting before [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] to discuss the situation of in the UN Security Council. ''[[El País]]'' leaked a [[Bush-Aznar memo|partial transcript of the meeting]]. The government handling of the wreckage of the Greek [[Prestige tanker]] near the Spanish coast, which resulted in a major ecological disaster, also became a divisive issue.

He actively encouraged and supported the Bush administration's foreign policy and the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, defending it on the basis of secret intelligence allegedly containing evidence of the Iraqi government's nuclear proliferation. The majority of the Spanish population, including some PP members, were against the war. Spain's major cities were the scene of the largest street demonstrations ever seen in the country as a result of the government's participation in the invasion. Aznar lost some support from those who had voted for the PP in 2000. On a live TV interview aired on the public station while demonstrations were taking place on the streets, he asked the Spanish people to take his word assuring there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, of which he had evidence. This is now regarded as incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;During a conference in [[Pozuelo de Alarcon]], Madrid, on 8 February 2007 Aznar said there were no [[weapons of mass destruction]] in Iraq prior to the [[Iraq War]], but that when he believed there were WMDs and no one could disprove their existence.{{cite web|author=|year=|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/199655/0/aznar/armas/destruccion/|title=Aznar sabe &quot;ahora&quot; que no había armas de destrucción masiva en Irak|publisher=20 Minutos|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=|url=http://video.google.es/videoplay?docid=-1301991900172521155|title=El ex presidente tarda cuatro años en reconocer la verdad sobre la guerra de Iraq|publisher=Google Video|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=|url=http://www.scp.nl/ess/eventnet/event.asp?id=1442|title=Aznar takes advantage of an act in Madrid with PP loyals to rectify his 2003 accusations about the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq|publisher=European Social Survey|accessdate=2008-01-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071114055843/http://www.scp.nl/ess/eventnet/event.asp?id=1442 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-14}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2004 Aznar called a general election and designated his successor as candidate, [[Mariano Rajoy]], sticking to a pledge of not seeking office for a third term. Despite political tensions, polls suggested that the Popular Party was set to win a third consecutive election on the strength of the economy.
An opinion poll carried out by the government-run CIS (which had estimated that 92% of the Spanish people did not support the War in Iraq) in February 2004 estimated that the PP would win an election with 42.2% of the vote while the PSOE would only get 35.5%.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Madrid train bombings and end of term===
{{Main|2004 Madrid train bombings}}
Three days before the [[Spanish general election, 2004|2004 general election]], 10 bombs killed 191 people in the [[2004 Madrid train bombings|11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings]]. Initially, the government and the opposition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3500452.stm|title=BBC: Scores die in Madrid bomb carnage|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2008-01-03 | date=11 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Juan José Ibarretxe Markuartu]], regional president in the [[Pais Vasco]]: &quot;When ETA attacks, the Basque heart breaks into a thousand pieces.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; stated publicly that it was possible the bombings may have been the work of [[ETA]]. However, the PP government continued to blame ETA even after evidence that the attacks may have been the work of an Islamist group emerged, having the Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Ana Palacio]] instruct all Spanish diplomats to place the blame on ETA at every opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=2004|url=http://www.cadenaser.com/articulo/espana/Exteriores/pidio/todas/embajadas/defendieran/autoria/ETA/csrcsrpor/20040312csrcsrnac_19/Tes/|title=Exteriores pidió a todas las embajadas que defendieran la authoría de ETA|publisher=Cadena Ser|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=|url=http://barcelona.indymedia.org/newswire/display/75859/index.php|title=Palacio ordenó a embajadores decir que ETA cometió los atentados|publisher=Barcelona Independent Media Center|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public perception that the government hid information from the general population gave rise to a public outcry. Two days after the Atocha bombings, demonstrations took place across Spain demanding news from the investigation, where chants such as &quot;We want the truth before we vote&quot; and &quot;Who is responsible?&quot; were heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=2004|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Miles/personas/exigen/calles/espanolas/les/diga/verdad/votar/elpepiesp/20040314elpepinac_7/Tes |title=Miles de personas exigen en las calles españolas que se les diga la verdad antes de votar|publisher=El Pais|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three days after the train bombings, the opposition PSOE won the elections. The subsequent investigations held by a Parliamentary Committee were characterized by bitter partisan exchanges between the different political parties, with dispute over who may have been responsible for the bombings. Aznar appeared before the Committee in November 2004 and declared his belief that the authors of the bombings were not to be found &quot;in faraway deserts or remote mountains.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paloma D. Sotero and Elena Mengual|year=2004|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2004/11/29/espana/1101724074.html|title=Aznar ataca al Gobierno y pide que se 'investigue la verdad' del 11-M|publisher=El Mundo|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aznar said in 2006 that he thought that the attacks were not exclusively perpetrated by Islamists.

==After 2004==
After leaving office on 17 April 2004 he presided over the [[FAES]] [[think tank]], which is associated with the PP. After a 2005 reform, promoted by the current Prime Minister of Spain Rodríguez Zapatero, former prime ministers were admitted into the [[Spanish Council of State]], a position from which he later resigned.

Aznar was appointed Distinguished Scholar in the Practice of Global Leadership at [[Georgetown University]] in Washington, D.C. in April 2004. In this position, he teaches two seminars per semester on contemporary European politics and trans-Atlantic relationships in the [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service]]. Additionally, he teaches a course on political leadership, convened by Professor Carol Lancaster, with former Polish President [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski|Kwasniewski]]. Aznar leads public dialogues on pressing contemporary concerns in collaboration with other members of the faculty; he was awarded an [http://www.newmedia.ufm.edu/gsm/index.php?title=Doctorado_Honor%C3%ADfico_a_Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Aznar honorary degree] at [http://www.ufm.edu Universidad Francisco Marroquin].

In 2007, Aznar was appointed to the advisory board of Centaurus Capital, a London based [[hedge fund]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James Mackintosh|year=2007|url=http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto060120071601098578|title=Centaurus hires high-profile advisers|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; an appointment which proved to be short-lived. In 2008, he was appointed to the [[Board of Directors]] of [[News Corporation]], the media conglomerate of [[Rupert Murdoch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dan Milmo|url=http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,1802922,00.html|title=Former Spanish PM to join Murdoch board|publisher=Guardian Business|accessdate=2008-01-03 | location=London | date=22 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also member of the European Advisory Panel of The [[European Business Awards]] and the [[European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation]].

Aznar is a member of the [[Club of Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clubmadrid.org The Club of Madrid] is an independent non-profit organization composed of 81 democratic former Presidents and Prime Ministers from 57 different countries. It constitutes the world´s largest forum of former Heads of State and Government, who have come together to respond to a growing demand for support among leaders in democratic leadership, governance, crisis and post-crisis situations. All lines of work share the common goal of building functional and inclusive societies, where the leadership experience of our Members is most valuable.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a Member of the [[Global Leadership Foundation]], an organization which works to promote good governance around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.g-l-f.org/pagebuilder.asp?id=239 Welcome to GLF Global Leadership Foundation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aznar was also one of the signatories and promoters of the [[Prague Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Support the Prague Charter |url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=64507 |newspaper=Jerusalem Post |date=June 11, 2007 |accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 founded the [[Friends of Israel Initiative]].

==Environmental Views==
In October 2008, on the occasion of a visit by the Czech President [[Václav Klaus]] to the Spanish capital, Aznar said that anthropogenic climate change is not a real phenomenon, but only a ‘scientifically questionable’ theory which had become the new religion, the followers of which were the ‘enemies of freedom’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.france24.com/en/20081023-aznar-questions-global-warming-spain-environment Aznar questions global warming], [[France 24]]&lt;/ref&gt;
These views were similar to those expressed by Klaus in his book &quot;Blue Planet in Green Shackles&quot;, which was published in Spanish by [[FAES]].&lt;ref&gt;The book was originally published in 2007 in Czech (''Modrá, nikoli zelená planeta''): the Spanish title is [http://www.fundacionfaes.org/en/documentos/gotagota/show/00786 ''Planeta azul (no verde)''].&lt;/ref&gt; Aznar's speech caused some puzzlement, as his government had been a signatory to the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in 1998, and it appeared that he had subsequently changed his mind about climate change.

The Partido Popular distanced itself from the current environmental views of its former leader, classing him among a &quot;sceptical minority&quot; within its membership, although there was support from Esperanza Aguirre who said that she and Aznar were in favour of a debate about climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/madrid/Aguirre/defiende/tala/pesca/caza/parques/naturales/elpepiespmad/20081107elpmad_4/Tes La presidenta respalda a Aznar sobre el cambio climático]
[[El País]]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009 Aznar was due to speak to a [[International Conference on Climate Change|Heartland Institute conference]] which was billed as the &quot;world's largest-ever gathering of global warming skeptics&quot;. He withdrew at short notice, and in the absence of a public explanation there was speculation that he did so in order to spare his party embarrassment.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Ansede (03 March 2009) [http://www.publico.es/ciencias/205836/aznar/borra/cumbre/negacionista/cambio/climatico &quot;Aznar borra cumbre negacionista&quot;], [[Público (Spain)|''Público'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 it was reported that Aznar would chair the Advisory Council of the Global Adaptation Institute, a new body concerned with [[adaptation to climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.GlobalAdaptationInstitute.org Global Adaptation Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on Israel==

In 2010, Aznar founded the [[Friends of Israel Initiative]], with the stated goal to &quot;counter the attempts to delegitimize the State of Israel and its right to live in peace within safe and defensible borders&quot;. Referring to the ill-fated takeover of the [[Mavi Marmara]] by Israeli commandos, Aznar said in 2010 that the world must support Israel because &quot;if it goes down, we all go down&quot;. He said that &quot;In an ideal world, the assault by Israeli commandos on the 'Mavi Marmara' would not have ended up with nine dead and a score wounded. In an ideal world, the soldiers would have been peacefully welcomed on to the ship.&quot; He criticized Turkey, for placing Israel &quot;in an impossible situation&quot; in which it would have to either give up its security or face world condemnation. Aznar concluded that Israel is the West's first line of defense, and must be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-Spain PM: If Israel goes down, we all go down|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3906657,00.html|accessdate=20 June 2010|newspaper=Ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Aznar's government posthumously granted a medal of Civil Merit to [[Melitón Manzanas]], the head of the [[secret police]] in [[San Sebastián]] and the first high-profile member of the Francoist government killed by [[ETA]] in 1968. Manzanas was widely considered a [[torturer]], and [[Amnesty International]] condemned the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=30 January 2001 | title=No deben tolerarse las recompensas a torturadores(They should not tolerate rewards to torturers) | publisher=Amnesty International | url=http://www.es.amnesty.org/com/2001/com_30ene01b.shtm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2004 elections it was revealed that Aznar and his government secretly channeled public funds to a United States legal firm to lobby for the bestowment of the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] on Aznar. The contract consisted in a first payment of $700,000 [[USD]] for the first seven months, followed by $100,000 monthly payments until it reached the sum of $2 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cadenaser.com/articulo/espana/Aznar/pago/dinero/publico/lobby/Washington/conseguir/medalla/Congreso/EEUU/csrcsrpor/20040722csrcsrnac_6/Tes/ Aznar pagó con dinero público a un &quot;lobby&quot; de Washington para conseguir la medalla del Congreso de EEUU (Cadena SER)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with BBC World on 27 July 2006 he voiced doubts about &quot;Islamists&quot; being the sole culprits of the disputed [[11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings]], &quot;You know in this moment some perpetrators of the attacks, but you do not know who imagined the attack, who is the leader of the attack, who is the idea (sic) of the attack, who established and supported means for the attacks, who defined the logistics of the attacks, who established the strategies of the attack. Nothing...I think that one part of the perpetrators are Islamists, but I think that this is not only an Islamist attack.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=2006|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqLGnyZ_ES4&amp;mode=related&amp;search=|title=Entrevista BBC Aznar, 24-07-2006 (Parte II de 3)|publisher=BBC World via YouTube|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a Washington, D.C. conference at the [[Hudson Institute]], a [[conservative]] U.S. [[think tank]], on 23 September 2006, referring to [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s [[Pope Benedict XVI Islam controversy|comments]] on [[Islam]] and violence, Aznar asked why Muslims had not apologized for occupying Spain for 800 years as [[Al-Andalus]]. He then called the [[Alliance of Civilizations]] initiative &quot;stupid.&quot; His reference to apologies was a response to the demonstrations asking the Pope to apologize. One [[People's Party (Spain)|PP]] official clarified Aznar's speech by saying the Prime Minister thought it is pointless to apologize for historical events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=|url=http://www.eitb24.com/portal/eitb24/noticia/en/politics/former-spanish-president-aznar-ldquomuslims-should-apologize-for-?itemId=B24_11616&amp;cl=%2Feitb24%2Fpolitica&amp;idioma=en|title=Aznar: &quot;Muslims should apologize for occupying Spain for 800 years&quot;|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|year=|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/09/22/internacional/1158945858.html|title=Aznar se pregunta por qué los musulmanes no se disculpan 'por haber ocupado España ocho siglos'|publisher=El Mundo|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1977 he married [[Ana Botella]], by whom he had three children: José María Aznar Botella, Ana Aznar Botella, born on 26 September 1981, and Alonso Aznar Botella.

Aznar is a grandfather. His daughter married at [[El Escorial]] on 5 September 2002 [[Alejandro Agag]], with whom she has four children, Alejandro (b. [[Madrid]], 4 June 2004), Rodrigo (b. [[Madrid]], 13 December 2005), Pelayo (b. [[Madrid]], 16 January 2008), and Alonso (b. [[Madrid]], 22 December 2010) Agag y Aznar.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geneall.net/H/per_page.php?id=467812&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 in response to persistent rumours, Aznar denied being the father of Zohra Dati, daughter of Ms [[Rachida Dati]], the then French Minister for Justice.&lt;ref&gt;([http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5478459.ece Return of 'Supermum' Rachida Dati, starts maternity leave row], ''Times Online'' Retrieved on 9 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juan Carlos I''' ({{IPA-es|ˈxwaŋ ˈkarlos}}, baptized as ''Juan Carlos Alfonso Víctor María de Borbón y Borbón-Dos Sicilias'' and born 5 January 1938) is the reigning [[List of Spanish monarchs|King of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt; His name, while rarely [[Anglicisation|anglicised]], is rendered as ''John Charles Alphonse Victor Mary of Bourbon and Bourbon-Two Sicilies''. He was given these baptismal names after his father (Juan de Borbón), grandfather (Alfonso XIII) and maternal grandfather (Prince Charles of Bourbon-Two Sicilies).&lt;/ref&gt; He is a direct descendant through the male line of [[Robert of Hesbaye]] (770-807), currently making the Spanish Royal Line one of the longest lived in the world, second only to the Japanese.

On 22 November 1975, two days after [[Francisco Franco|General Franco's]] death, Juan Carlos was designated king according to the law of succession promulgated by Franco. Spain had no monarch for 38 years in 1969 when Franco named Juan Carlos as the next head of state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10C14F83D591A7493C6A8178AD95F458785F9&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=akihito%20%20and%20Windsor&amp;st=cse  &quot;Those Apprentice Kings and Queens Who May – One Day – Ascend a Throne,&quot;] ''New York Times.'' 14 November 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]], voted in [[referendum]], acknowledges him expressly as King of Spain. The Spanish Constitution, Title II: the Crown, Article 56, Subsection 1, affirms the role of the Spanish monarch as the [[personify|personification and embodiment]] of the [[Spanish people|Spanish nation]], a symbol of Spain's enduring unity and permanence; and as such, the monarch is the [[head-of-state]] and [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Spanish Armed Forces]] in a system known in Spanish as ''[[Constitutional monarchy|monarquía parlamentaria]]'' (constitutional monarchy).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiki Source Spa Constitution 78&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Title II&quot;&gt;Title II, Article 56, Subsection 1, Text: &lt;br /&gt;''The King is Head of State, the symbol of its unity and permanence. He arbitrates and moderates the regular functioning of the institutions, assumes the highest representation of the Spanish State in international relations, especially with the nations of its historical community, and exercises the functions expressly conferred on him by the Constitution and the laws''&lt;br /&gt;''El Rey es el Jefe del Estado, símbolo de su unidad y permanencia, arbitra y modera el funcionamiento regular de las instituciones, asume la más alta representación del Estado español en las relaciones internacionales, especialmente con las naciones de su comunidad histórica, y ejerce las funciones que le atribuyen expresamente la Constitución y las leyes''&lt;/ref&gt; 

King Juan Carlos successfully oversaw the [[Spanish transition to democracy|transition of Spain]] from dictatorship to [[parliamentary monarchy]].

Juan Carlos married [[Queen Sofía of Spain|Sophia of Greece and Denmark]] in 1962. The couple have three children and eight grandchildren.

Polls from 2000 show that he is widely approved of by Spaniards.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.elpais.com/especiales/2000/rey/rey.swf Los españoles de hoy y el franquismo], (&quot;The Spaniards of today and Francoism&quot;), ''[[El País]]'', undated[[Adobe Shockwave]] file, part of [http://www.elpais.com/especiales/2000/rey/ Un rey para una democracia], 2000. Accessed online 29 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Spanish Constitution, the monarch is also instrumental in promoting [[Ibero-America]]n relations, the &quot;nations of its historical community&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiki Source Spa Constitution 78&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Title II&quot;/&gt; In this capacity, the King of Spain serves as the president of the [[Ibero-American States Organization]], representing over 700,000,000 people in 24 member nations worldwide. In 2008 he was considered the most popular leader in all [[Ibero-America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2008/07/09/internacional/1215635605.html Juan Carlos most popular leader in Ibero-America (spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Juan Carlos of Spain was born to the [[Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona]], and the [[Princess María Mercedes of Bourbon-Two Sicilies]] in [[Rome]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]], where his grandfather, King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]], and other members of the Spanish [[royal family]] had settled following the proclamation of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] in 1931. His early life was dictated largely by the political concerns of his father and General Franco. He moved to Spain in 1948 to be [[education|educated]] there after his father persuaded Franco to allow it. He began his studies in [[San Sebastián]] and finished them in 1954 at the [[San Isidro Institute]] in Madrid. He then joined the army, doing his officer training from 1955 to 1957 at the [[Military academy|Military Academy]] of Zaragoza.

Juan Carlos has two sisters and one brother: [[Infanta Pilar, Duchess of Badajoz]] (born 1936), and [[Infanta Margarita, Duchess of Soria]] (born 1939) and his younger brother [[Infante Alfonso of Spain|Alfonso]].

In March 1956, Juan Carlos's younger brother Alfonso died in a gun accident at the family's home Villa Giralda in [[Estoril]], Portugal. The Spanish Embassy in Portugal issued an official communiqué:&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Paul Preston]], ''Juan Carlos: Steering Spain from Dictatorship to Democracy'' (New York: [[W. W. Norton|W.W. Norton]], 2004), 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

: Whilst [[Highness|His Highness]] Prince Alfonso was cleaning a revolver last evening with his brother, a shot was fired hitting his forehead and killing him in a few minutes. The accident took place at 20.30 hours, after the Infante's return from the [[Maundy Thursday]] religious service, during which he had received [[Eucharist|holy communion]].

Very quickly, however, rumours appeared in newspapers that the gun had actually been held by Juan Carlos at the moment the shot was fired. Josefina Carolo, dressmaker to Juan Carlos's mother, said that Juan Carlos pointed the pistol at Alfonso and pulled the trigger, unaware that the pistol was loaded. Bernardo Arnoso, a Portuguese friend of Juan Carlos, also said that Juan Carlos fired the pistol not knowing that it was loaded, and adding that the bullet ricocheted off a wall hitting Alfonso in the face. Helena Matheopoulos, a Greek author who spoke with Juan Carlos's sister [[Infanta Pilar, Duchess of Badajoz|Pilar]], said that Alfonso had been out of the room and when he returned and pushed the door open, the door knocked Juan Carlos in the arm causing him to fire the pistol.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 Juan Carlos spent a year in the [[Spanish Navy (Armada Española)|naval]] school at [[Marín, Pontevedra|Marin]], [[Pontevedra]], and another in the [[Spanish Air Force|Air Force]] school in [[San Javier, Murcia|San Javier]] in [[Murcia]]. In 1960–1 he studied Law, International Political Economy and Public Finance at [[Complutense University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casareal.es/sm_rey/index-ides-idweb.html Su Majestad el Rey Don Juan Carlos], Página oficial de la Casa de Su Majestad el Re, retrieved 16 September 2011 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then went to live in the [[Palace of Zarzuela]], and began carrying out official engagements.

==Prince of Spain, 1969–1975==
The dictatorial regime of [[Francisco Franco]] had come to power during the [[Spanish Civil War]], which had pitted democrats, anarchists, socialists, and communists, supported in part by the [[Soviet Union]] and by international volunteers, against conservatives, monarchists, nationalists, and fascists, with the latter group ultimately emerging successful with the support of neighbouring Portugal and the major European [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]] of [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]]. Despite his alliance with monarchists, Franco was not eager to restore the deposed Spanish monarchy once in power, preferring to head a regime with himself as [[head of state]] for life. Though Franco's partisan supporters generally accepted this arrangement for the present, much debate quickly ensued over who would replace Franco upon his death. The far right factions demanded the return of a hardline [[absolute monarchy]], and eventually Franco agreed that his successor would be a monarch. Franco, a Carlist by some accounts, had no intention of restoring the constitutional form of monarchy known during the 19th century or [[Republic|the republican form of government]] created by the [[Spanish Constitution of 1931]].

The heir to the throne of Spain was [[Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona|Juan de Borbón]] ''(Count of Barcelona)'', the son of the late [[Alfonso XIII]]. However, General Franco viewed the heir with extreme suspicion, believing him to be a liberal who was opposed to his regime. In 1961, Franco offered the crown to [[Otto von Habsburg|Archduke Otto of Austria]], but he declined on account of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg dynasty]]'s long absence from the Spanish throne, and recommended Juan Carlos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/07/04/general-eu-germany-obit-habsburg_8548589.html|title=Otto von Habsburg who saw end of empire dead at 98|work=Forbes|accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Franco then considered giving the Spanish throne to Juan Carlos's cousin [[Alfonso, Duke of Anjou and Cádiz]].  Alfonso was known to be an ardent Francoist and would marry Franco's granddaughter, Doña [[María del Carmen Martínez-Bordiú y Franco]] in 1972. In response, Juan Carlos started to use his second name ''[[Charles|Carlos]]'' to assert his claim to the heritage of the [[Carlist]] branch of his family.

Ultimately, Franco decided to skip a generation and name Juan de Borbón's son, Prince Juan Carlos, as his personal successor. Franco hoped the young prince could be groomed to take over the nation while still maintaining the ultraconservative nature of his regime. In 1969, Juan Carlos was officially designated heir-apparent and was given the new title of Prince of Spain (not the traditional [[Prince of Asturias]]).  As a condition of being named heir-apparent, he had to swear loyalty to Franco's [[Movimiento Nacional]], which he did with little outward hesitation.

Prince Juan Carlos met and consulted Franco many times while [[heir apparent]] and often took part in official and ceremonial state functions standing alongside the dictator, much to the anger of hardline republicans and more moderate liberals, who had hoped that Franco's death would bring in an era of reform. During 1969–1975, Juan Carlos publicly supported Franco's regime. Although Franco's health worsened during those years, whenever he did appear in public, from state dinners to military parades, it was in Juan Carlos's company as he continued to praise Franco and his government for the economic growth and positive changes in Spain. However, as the years progressed, Juan Carlos began meeting secretly with [[political opposition]] leaders and exiles, who were fighting to bring liberal reform to the country. He also had secret conversations with his father over the telephone. Franco, for his part, remained largely oblivious to the prince's actions and denied allegations from his ministers and advisors that Juan Carlos was in any way disloyal to his vision of the regime.

During periods of Franco's temporary incapacity in 1974 and 1975 Juan Carlos was [[acting (law)|acting]] head of state. Near death, on 30 October 1975, Franco gave full control to Juan Carlos. On 22 November, following Franco's death, the [[Cortes Generales]] proclaimed Juan Carlos King of Spain and on 27 November, Juan Carlos was anointed king in a ceremony called ''Holy Spirit Mass'', which was the equivalent of a [[coronation]], at the [[San Jerónimo el Real|Jerónimos Church]] in Madrid.

==Restoration of the monarchy==
[[File:King Juan Carlos I Royal Trips.PNG|thumb|right|Royal trips of King Juan Carlos I from 1975 until today.]]

Juan Carlos quickly instituted reforms, to the great displeasure of [[Falangist]] and conservative ([[monarchist]]) elements, especially in the military, who had expected him to maintain the authoritarian state. He appointed [[Adolfo Suárez]], a former leader of the [[Movimiento Nacional (Spain)|Movimiento Nacional]], as [[President of the Government of Spain|Prime Minister of Spain]].

[[Image:Nicolae e Juan Carlos.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Juan Carlos greeting [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], [[President of Romania]], during his visit to Spain in 1979]]
On 20 May 1977, the leader of the only recently legalized [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) [[Felipe González]], accompanied by [[Javier Solana]], visited Juan Carlos in the Zarzuela Palace. The event represented a key endorsement of the monarchy from Spain's [[Left-wing politics|political left]], who had been historically [[republicanism|republican]]. Left-wing support for the monarchy grew when the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] was legalized shortly thereafter, a move Juan Carlos had pressed for, despite enormous right-wing military opposition at that time, during the [[Cold War]].

On 15 June 1977, Spain held its first post-Franco democratic elections. In 1978, a new [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Constitution]] was promulgated that acknowledged Juan Carlos as rightful heir of the Spanish [[dynasty]] and King; specifically, Title II, Section 57 asserted Juan Carlos' right to the throne of Spain by dynastic succession in the Borbón tradition, as &quot;the legitimate heir of the historic dynasty&quot; rather than as the designated successor of Franco.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiki Source Spa Constitution 78&quot;&gt;[http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Constituci%C3%B3n_espa%C3%B1ola_de_1978:_04 Título II. De la Corona, Wikisource]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Title II, Section 57, Subsection 1: &lt;br /&gt; ''&quot;The Crown shall be inherited by the successors of H.M. Juan Carlos I de Borbón, the legitimae heir of the historic dynasty.&quot;'' &lt;br /&gt; ''&quot;La Corona de España es hereditaria en los sucesores de S. M. Don Juan Carlos I de Borbón, legítimo heredero de la dinastía histórica.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution was passed by the democratically elected [[Constituent Cortes]], ratified by the people in a referendum (6 December) and then signed into law by the King before a solemn meeting of the Cortes.

Further legitimacy had been restored to Juan Carlos' position on 14 May 1977, when his father, Don Juan (whom many monarchists had recognized as the legitimate, exiled King of Spain during the [[Spain under Franco|Franco era]]), formally renounced his claim to the Throne and recognized his son as the sole head of the Spanish [[Royal House]], transferring to him the historical heritage of the Spanish monarchy, thus making Juan Carlos both the ''de facto'' and the ''[[de jure]]'' (rightful) King in the eyes of the traditional monarchists. Juan Carlos, who had already been King since Franco's death, gave an acceptance address after his father's [[resignation speech]] and thanked him by confirming the title of [[List of Counts of Barcelona|Count of Barcelona]] that Don Juan had assumed in exile.
It was a sovereign title associated to the crown.

An attempted military coup, known as [[23-F]], occurred on 23 February 1981, when the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] were seized by members of the [[Guardia Civil]] in the [[Chambers of parliament|parliamentary chamber]]. Believed to be a major factor in foiling the coup was the public [[Broadcasting|television broadcast]] by the king, calling for unambiguous support for the legitimate [[Democracy|democratic government]]. Certainly, in the hours before his speech, he had personally called many senior military figures to tell them that he was opposed to the coup and that they had to defend the democratic government.&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:SelloJuanCarlosI.jpg|right|thumb|130px|Current Spanish [[Correos]] stamp depicting King Juan Carlos I.]] --&gt;

When Juan Carlos became king, [[Communist Party of Spain|Communist]] leader [[Santiago Carrillo]] nicknamed him ''Juan Carlos the Brief'', predicting that the monarchy would soon be swept away with the other remnants of the Franco era. After the collapse of the attempted coup mentioned above, however, in an emotional statement, Carrillo told television viewers: &quot;God save the king.&quot; The Communist leader also remarked: &quot;Today, we are all monarchists.&quot; If public support for the monarchy among democrats and leftists before 1981 had been limited, following the king's handling of the coup, it became significantly greater. According to a poll in the newspaper ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'' in November 2005, 77.5% of Spaniards thought Juan Carlos was &quot;good or very good&quot;, 15.4% &quot;not so good&quot;, and only 7.1% &quot;bad or very bad&quot;. Even so, the issue of the monarchy re-emerged on 28 September 2007 as photos of the king were burnt in public in [[Catalonia]] by small groups of protesters wanting the restoration of the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://eux.tv/article.aspx?articleId=15269 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081201063734/http://eux.tv/article.aspx?articleId=15269 |archivedate=1 December 2008 |title=Spanish royals worried about protests against monarchy |publisher=EUX.TV |last=Tarvainen |first=Sinikka |date=28 September 2007 |accessdate=29 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2000, Juan Carlos was the target of an enraged protester when [[Juan María Fernández y Krohn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.gva.be/dossiers/-k/koningshuis/actua2000/actua147.asp |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080317085858/http://www.gva.be/dossiers/-k/koningshuis/actua2000/actua147.asp |archivedate=17 March 2008 |title='Belager' koning Albert komt er goedkoop vanaf |last=Cardyn |first=Hans |publisher=Gazet Van Antwerpen|accessdate=29 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had previously tried to take the life of [[Pope John Paul II]], began shouting &quot;Murderer! Murderer!&quot; at the king and then approached him in a very threatening manner.

==Role in contemporary Spanish politics==
The election of socialist leader [[Felipe González]] to the Spanish prime ministership in 1982 marked the effective end of the King's active involvement in Spanish politics. González would govern for over a decade, and his administration helped consolidate the democratic gains and thus maintained the stability of the nation. While the king is generally reckoned as having a merely ceremonial role in politics, he commands great moral authority as an essential symbol of the country's unity.

[[File:5000pelas.JPG|right|center|thumb|400px|5000 [[Spanish peseta]] note with image of King Juan Carlos.]]

Under the constitution, the King has immunity from prosecution in matters relating to his official duties. This is so because every act of the King as such (and not as a citizen) needs to be undersigned by a government official, thus making the undersigner responsible instead of the king.
The honour of the Royal Family is specially protected from offences by the [[Spanish Penal Code]].
Under this protection, Basque independentist [[Arnaldo Otegi]]&lt;ref name=BBCslander&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4407134.stm Basque convicted for king insult], ''[[BBC News]]'', 4 November 2005. Accessed online 29 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and cartoonists from ''[[El Jueves]]'' were tried and punished.

The King gives an annual speech to the nation on Christmas Eve. He is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the Spanish armed forces.

When the media asked Juan Carlos in 2005 if he would endorse the bill legalising [[Same-sex marriage in Spain|gay marriage]] that was then being debated in the ''Cortes Generales'', he answered ''&quot;Soy el Rey de España y no el de Bélgica&quot;'' (&quot;I am the King of Spain, not of Belgium&quot;){{ndash}} a reference to King [[Baudouin of Belgium|Baudouin I of Belgium]], who refused to sign the Belgian law legalising abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Es icon}} {{cite news |title=Don Juan Carlos, sobre el matrimonio gay: 'Soy el Rey de España y no el de Bélgica' |publisher=El Mundo|date=13 May 2006|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/05/12/espana/1115917538.html |accessdate=8 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The King gave his [[Royal Assent]] to Law 13/2005 on 1 July 2005; the law legalising gay marriage was [[gazette]]d in the ''[[Boletín Oficial del Estado]]'' on 2 July, and came into effect on 3 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{Es icon}} {{cite web|title=Disposiciones Generales |publisher=Boletin Oficial del Estado|date=2 June 2005 |url=http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2005/07/02/pdfs/A23632-23634.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=8 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007 at the [[Ibero-American Summit]] in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago de Chile]], during a heated exchange, Juan Carlos interrupted  [[List of Presidents of Venezuela|Venezuelan President]] [[Hugo Chávez]] and asked him, &quot;''[[¿Por qué no te callas?]]''&quot; (&quot;Why don't you shut up?&quot; using the familiar &quot;tu&quot; you form to underline the disdain). Chávez had been interrupting the Spanish Prime Minister, [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]], while the latter was defending his predecessor and political opponent, [[José María Aznar]], after Chávez had referred to Aznar as a fascist and &quot;less human than snakes&quot;.  The King shortly afterwards left the hall when President [[Daniel Ortega]] of [[Nicaragua]] accused Spain of intervention in his country's elections and complained about some Spanish energy companies working in Nicaragua.&lt;ref name=&quot;antena3-20071111&quot;&gt;{{Es icon}} {{Cite web|url=http://www.antena3.com/a3noticias/servlet/Noticias?destino=../a3n/noticia/noticia.jsp&amp;sidicom=si&amp;id=13286798| title=El Rey Don Juan Carlos a Hugo Chávez: &quot;¿Por qué no te callas?&quot;|accessdate=11 November 2007|publisher=[[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]]|date=11 November 2007}} (&quot;King Juan Carlos to Hugo Chávez: 'Why don't you shut up?'&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;  This was an unprecedented diplomatic incident and a rare display of public anger by the King.&lt;ref&gt;{{Es icon}} {{cite news|url=http://www.elperiodico.com/default.asp?idpublicacio_PK=46&amp;idioma=CAS&amp;idnoticia_PK=457570&amp;idseccio_PK=1007| title= Nunca se había visto al Rey tan enfadado en público|date=10 November 2007|accessdate=10 November 2007}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}} (&quot;Never has the King been seen so angry in public&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and private life==

Juan Carlos was married in [[Athens]] at the Church of Saint Dennis on 14 May 1962, to HRH [[Queen Sofía of Spain|Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark]], daughter of [[Paul of Greece|King Paul]]. She was [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] but converted to Roman Catholicism in order to become Spain's queen. Also in 1962, a Roman Catholic wedding was performed in the Pauline Chapel the [[Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome.

They have two daughters and a son.

In 1972, Juan Carlos, a keen sailor, competed in the [[Dragon (keelboat)|Dragon class]] event at the [[1972 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]], finishing [[Sailing at the 1972 Summer Olympics – Dragon|15th]]. In their [[summer holiday]]s, the whole family meets in [[Marivent]] Palace ([[Palma de Mallorca]]) and the [[Fortuna (yacht)|Fortuna]] yacht, where they take part in sailing competitions. The king has manned the [[Bribón]] series of yachts. In winter, they usually go [[skiing]] in [[Baqueira-Beret]] and [[Candanchú]] ([[Pyrenees]]), where the king has occasionally ended with a broken leg.

Juan Carlos also enjoys [[bear hunting]]. In October 2004, he angered [[Environmentalism|environmental activists]] by killing nine bears (of which one was a pregnant female) in central Romania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/01/23729b67-d43a-4711-89aa-afef9326c53c.html Romania: Elite Hunting Spree Sparks Calls For Better Animal Protection], ''[[RFE/RL]]'', 27 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2006, it is alleged that Juan Carlos shot a drunken tame bear (Mitrofan) during a private hunting trip to Russia. The Office of the Spanish Monarchy denies this claim, which was made by the Russian regional authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6070656.stm &quot;Royal row over Russian bear fate&quot;], ''[[BBC]]'', 20 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Juan Carlos and Sophia are fluent in several languages. They both speak Spanish, English, and French. The king also speaks fluent Italian and Catalan. Unlike the queen, Juan Carlos does not speak any German, nor her native language, Greek, a fact he regrets.

Juan Carlos is an [[amateur radio operator]] and holds the call sign EA0JC.
His fondness of [[wiktionary:incognito|incognito]] motorbike riding has raised [[urban legend]]s of people finding him on lonely roads. For example, one story says that a biker out of petrol stranded on a hot sunny day was assisted by a fellow motorcyclist, who returned with a small container of petrol. The good-Samaritan, on removing his helmet, turned out to be Juan Carlos.

Juan Carlos is member of the [[World Scout Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Einladung zun Pressegespräch am 18.September-World Scout Foundation in Österreich-Seine Mäjestät Carl XVI von Schweden zu Gast in Wien|url=http://www.ppoe.at/presse/pdf/wsf_pressegespraech.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate =14 September 2008|language=German|publisher=Pfadfinder und Pfadfinderinnen Österreichs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His net worth is only valued at $5 million, but the Royal Family have a net worth over $1.7 billion (December 2011).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalinsight.net/content/spanish-monarchy-frequently-asked-questions&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sueddeutsche.de/geld/bildstrecke-fuerstliches-vermoegen-1.234309-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==

A benign tumour was removed from King Juan Carlos’ lung in an operation carried out in the &quot;Hospital Clínic&quot; of Barcelona on Saturday 8 May 2010. The 72-year-old Monarch was expected to be allowed home in three or four days, and able to renew full physical activity in a fortnight. The operation came as a result of the King’s latest annual check-up, and doctors said the procedure went well and Juan Carlos would not need any further follow-up treatment. At a press convention the operating team said that the 17-19mm tumour which had been removed under a general anaesthetic from the right lung contained no malignant cells. ‘This is good news’, said doctor Laureano Molins, who had directed the operation.

== Budget of the royal house ==

In the wake of the [[Iñaki Urdangarin, Duke of Palma de Mallorca|Urdangarin]] affair (the husband of his daughter is accused of corruption), the King decided in 2011 to detail the yearly royal budget of 8.3 millions euros for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;politica.elpais.com&quot;&gt;http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2011/12/28/actualidad/1325105881_885673.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.casareal.es/noticias/news/20111228_desglose_presupuestario-ides-idweb.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, some spending such as the electricity bill are not included in the 8.3 budget since they are paid by the State.&lt;ref name=&quot;politica.elpais.com&quot;/&gt;

==Titles, styles, honours and arms==
===Titles===
{{Main|List of titles and honours of Juan Carlos I of Spain|List of titles and honours of the Spanish Crown}}

The current [[Constitution of Spain|Spanish constitution]] refers to the monarchy as &quot;the Crown of Spain&quot; and the constitutional title of the monarch is simply ''Rey/Reina de España'': that is, &quot;king/queen of Spain&quot;. However, the constitution allows for the use of other historic titles pertaining to the Spanish monarchy, without specifying them. A decree promulgated 6 November 1987 at the Council of Ministers regulates the titles further, and on that basis the monarch of Spain has a right to use (&quot;may use&quot;) those other titles appertaining to the Crown. Contrary to some belief, the long titulary that contains the list of over 20 kingdoms, etc., is not in state use, nor is it used in Spanish diplomacy. In fact, it has never been in use in that form, as &quot;Spain&quot; was never a part of the list in pre-1837 era when the long list was officially used.

This feudal style was last used officially in 1836, in the [[Isabella II of Spain#Titulary|titulary]] of [[Isabella II of Spain]] before she became constitutional Queen.

Juan Carlos's titles include that of [[Kings of Jerusalem|King of Jerusalem]], as successor to the royal family of [[Naples]].

Juan Carlos' patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son.

[[Patrilineal descent]] is the principle behind membership in royal houses, as it can be traced back through the generations, which means that Juan Carlos I is a member of the [[House of Bourbon]], the senior-surviving cadet branch of the [[Capetian dynasty]].

'''León''' is one of the 52 electoral districts ({{lang-es|circunscripciones}}) used for the [[Spanish Congress of Deputies|Congress of Deputies]], the lower chamber of the [[Spain|Spanish]] Parliament, the [[Cortes Generales]]. It was first contested in modern times in the [[Spanish general election, 1977|1977 General Election]].  Notable former deputies include the current [[Prime Minister of Spain]] [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]]. 

==Boundaries and electoral system==
Under Article 68 of the Spanish constitution &lt;ref name=&quot;Spanish Constitution&quot;&gt;[http://www.mir.es/DGPI/Normativa/Normativa_Estatal/Constitucion_Espanola/constitucion_espanola.html Spanish Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt;
the boundaries must be the same as the [[León (province)|province of León]] and under Article 140 this can only be altered with the approval of congress. Voting is on the basis of [[universal suffrage]] in a [[secret ballot]]. The electoral system used is [[closed list]] [[proportional representation]] with seats allocated using the [[D'Hondt method]]. Only lists which poll 3% or more of all valid votes cast, including votes &quot;en blanco&quot; i.e. for &quot;none of the above&quot; can be considered for seats. Under article 12 of the constitution, the minimum voting age is 18.

[[León, Spain|León]] is the largest city with 108,000 voters, just over one-quarter of the total electorate of 414,000 on 1 May 2008,&lt;ref name=&quot;Electorates by municipality 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ine.es/censoe/censo_cerrado/cermun_08.xls|title= Number of voters by municipality 2008 |publisher=Spanish census office|accessdate=2009-04-11}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the next largest municipalities being [[Ponferrada]] (54,000 voters), [[San Andrés del Rabanedo]] (24,000) and [[Villaquilambre]] (12,000). There were no other municipalities with more than 10,000 voters.

{{PoliticsES}}

==Eligibility==
Article 67.3 of the Spanish Constitution prohibits dual membership of the Cortes and regional assemblies, meaning that candidates must resign from Regional Assemblies if elected. Article 70 also makes active judges, magistrates, public defenders, serving military personnel, active police officers and members of constitutional and electoral tribunals ineligible. &lt;ref name=&quot;Spanish Constitution&quot;/&gt;

==Number of members==
In the general elections of [[Spanish general election, 1977|1977]], [[Spanish general election, 1979|1979]] and [[Spanish general election, 1982|1982]] León returned 6 members. That figure was reduced to 5 members for the [[Spanish general election, 1986|1986 election]] and it has stayed at that figure since then.

Under Spanish electoral law, all provinces are entitled to a minimum of 2 seats with a remaining 248 seats apportioned according to population. &lt;ref&gt;[http://electionresources.org/es/index_en.html General features of Spanish electoral system]&lt;/ref&gt; These laws are laid out in detail in the 1985 electoral law. (Ley Orgánica del Régimen Electoral General) The practical effect of this law has been to overrepresent smaller provinces at the expense of larger provinces.

In 2004 Spain had 34,571,831 voters giving an average of 98,777 voters per deputy &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionresources.org/es/congress.php?election=2004 2004 Spanish election]&lt;/ref&gt;. In León the ratio was slightly below that at 90,556.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionresources.org/es/congress.php?election=2004&amp;province=24 Leon 2004 election results]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the general elections of 1977, 1979 and 1982 Madrid returned 32 members. That figure was increased to 33 members for the 1986 General Election, to 34 members for the 1993 election and then to its current figure of 35 from the 2004 General Election.

Under Spanish electoral law, all provinces are entitled to a minimum of 2 seats with a remaining 248 seats apportioned according to population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://electionresources.org/es/index_en.html General features of Spanish electoral system]&lt;/ref&gt; These laws are laid out in detail in the 1985 electoral law. (Ley Orgánica del Régimen Electoral General) The practical effect of this law has been to overrepresent smaller provinces at the expense of larger provinces like Madrid.

In 2004 for example Spain had 34,571,831 voters giving an average of 98,777 voters per deputy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionresources.org/es/congress.php?election=2004 2004 Spanish election]&lt;/ref&gt; In Madrid however the number of voters per deputy was 127,377&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionresources.org/es/congress.php?election=2004&amp;province=28 Madrid 2004 result]&lt;/ref&gt; the second largest ratio after Barcelona. In contrast the ratio was 38,714 and 26,177 respectively in the smallest provinces of Teruel &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionresources.org/es/congress.php?election=2004&amp;province=44 Teruel 2004 result]&lt;/ref&gt; and Soria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionresources.org/es/congress.php?election=2004&amp;province=42 Soria 2004 result]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Party strength by municipality==
Generally certain patterns have emerged in recent elections. The Popular Party (PP) normally polls best in the City of Madrid, with the PSOE polling best in the smaller municipalities, particularly those in the 'sur metropolitano' (South Metropolitan region) area which consists of the satellite towns to the immediate south and of Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madrid.org/iestadis/fijas/estructu/general/otros/descarga/congreso04t4.pdf Party votes by municipalities]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Within the Madrid autonomous community, PP generally polled best in the municipalities in the north and west of the community, while PSOE does best in the south and east of the community. IU normally failed to break the 10% barrier, but did do relatively well in many of the smaller municipalities and in one of them, Berzosa del Lozoya, in the north of the autonomous community, outpolled the other parties, albeit by just one vote out of 106 cast.

Exactly the same pattern was evident in 2004 within Madrid city itself with PP polling best in the districts in the north western half of the city and PSOE doing best in the south eastern half. PP polled best in the districts of Chamartín (67.9%), [[Salamanca (Madrid)|Salamanca]] (67.7%) and [[Chamberí (Madrid)|Chamberí]] (64.9%) while PSOE's best vote shares came in the [[Vallecas]] districts where they polled 61.4% in Puente de Vallecas and 56.9% in Villa de Vallecas. IU's best result was in [[Centro (Madrid)|Centro]] where they polled 10.4%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.madrid.org/iestadis/fijas/estructu/general/otros/descarga/congreso04t6.pdfParty votes within the city of Madrid 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Spanish general election, 2008|2008 Election]]==

As traditionally the prime ministerial candidate of each party is the leader of the Madrid list, PSOE's, PP's and IU's lists were led by [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]], [[Mariano Rajoy]] and [[Gaspar Llamazares]] respectively. In many political parties it is usually the number two on these lists who are considered the leader and left for discussion within the regional party branches. The current [[Second Vice-president (Spain)|Second Vice-President]] [[Pedro Solbes]] was offered this position &lt;ref&gt;{{es}}[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jMJ_HFRdZft-o048OKgbdNpR-gSg - AFP 26/11/07 Solbes will continue in the Government and be number two for Madrid]&lt;/ref&gt; with confederal environment Secretary of the [[Workers' Commissions]] trade union, Joaquin Nieto being offered that position for IU &lt;ref&gt;{{es}}[http://www.publico.es/espana/027474/gasparllamazares/joaquinnieto/iu/ccoo/congresodelosdiputados/eleccionesgenerales/2008 Público 14/12/07 Llamazares has a number two.]&lt;/ref&gt; Manuel Pizzarro, former Chairman of [[Endesa (Chile)|ENDESA]], was chosen to run as number two in the Madrid list of the Peoples' Party, his draft was announced at the time that current [[List of mayors of Madrid|Mayor Madrid]] [[Alberto Ruiz Gallardón]] was rejected for taking part in the party list.

'''Mariano Rajoy Brey''' ({{IPA-es|maˈɾjano raˈxoi}}; born 27 March 1955) is a Spanish [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] politician and the current [[Prime Minister of Spain]], having served since 21 December 2011.

Under [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]] [[José María Aznar]], Rajoy was Minister of Public Administration from 1996 to 1999 and Minister of Education from 1999 to 2000; he then served as Deputy Prime Minister from 2000 to 2003. Rajoy led the People's Party into the [[Spanish general election, 2004|March 2004 general election]], but that election was won by the opposition [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) in the aftermath of the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]]. Subsequently Rajoy was [[Leader of the Opposition (Spain)|Leader of the Opposition]] from 2004 to 2011.

==Early life and education==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=November 2011}}
Born in [[Santiago de Compostela]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], Rajoy graduated from the [[University of Santiago de Compostela]]. At the age of 24, he passed the competitive examination required in Spain to enter into the civil service, becoming the youngest ever property [[Recorder of deeds|registrar]].
Rajoy is the grandson of Henry Rajoy Leloup, one of the drafters of the Statute of Autonomy of Galicia in 1932 that was removed from university teaching by the dictatorship to the early 50's and is the son of Mariano Rajoy Sobredo jurist, president of the Provincial Court Pontevedra, a city where he grew up. His mother was Olga Lopez Brey, who died in 1993.

Law degree from the University of Santiago de Compostela, began preparing objections to the registrar of property in the final year and approved the following year. At 24 became the youngest registrar Spain. He was assigned to Register (Galicia), in Villafranca del Bierzo (León) and Santa Pola (Alicante) which still holds. With the same age, Rajoy was wounded in the face following a traffic accident. Since then, always wears a beard to hide the scars of these injuries.

However, being a registrar of property not delivered to the young Rajoy to the late conscription, which was primarily concerned with cleaning up the stairs of the Captaincy General of Valencia, graduating at the end of 1980.

==Legislative career==
===Early political career===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2011}}
Rajoy started his political career in 1981, as a member of the right-wing party [[People's Alliance]] (AP), becoming a deputy in the inaugural legislature of the [[Galician Parliament]]. In 1982, he was appointed by [[President of the Xunta de Galicia|Galician regional President]], Antonio Rosón Pérez, as Minister of Institutional Relations of the [[Xunta de Galicia]]. On June 11, 1986, Rajoy was elected President of the Provincial Council of [[Pontevedra]], a position he held until July 1991.

In the [[Spanish general election, 1986|General Elections]] of 22 June 1986, he obtained a seat in the Congress of Deputies as the head of the AP's list for [[Pontevedra (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Pontevedra]], although he resigned in November to take up the post of vice-president of the Xunta of Galicia following the resignation of Xosé Luis Barreiro and the rest of the ministers. He occupied this latter position until the end of September 1987.

When in 1989 the AP merged with other parties to form the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP), with [[Manuel Fraga]] as its president, Rajoy was named a member of its National Executive Committee and delegate for Pontevedra. He was reelected to parliament in 1993. Before the PP's triumph in the 1996 elections, he was a PP-designated member of the &quot;Commission of Parliamentary Control of the [[RTVE]]&quot;.

===Minister of the Interior: 1996–2004===
A long-time associate of [[José María Aznar]], Rajoy made the move into national politics when Aznar became Prime Minister in 1996 with the support of [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV), [[Convergence and Union]] (CiU) and the [[Canarian Coalition]], serving as  Minister of Public administration and Minister of Education and Culture in the first Aznar administration.

In 1996 he married a fellow Galician, Elvira Fernandez Balboa.

He managed the successful People's Party campaign in the [[Spanish legislative election, 2000|2000 elections]]. A grateful Aznar appointed him Deputy Prime Minister of the Spanish Government. In February 2001 he was named Minister of the Interior, after [[Jaime Mayor Oreja]] decided to run as head of the People's Party list in the [[Basque parliamentary election, 2001|2001 Basque Elections]].

On 30 August 2003 Aznar announced that he would retire from politics in the 2004 elections and proposed Rajoy as his successor. After the 14th Congress of the People's Party in October 2004 he became the new Chairman of the party, by then in the opposition, having lost the elections to the PSOE.

===Leader of the Opposition: 2004–2011===
Three days before the [[Spanish legislative election, 2004|2004 general elections]] [[11 March 2004 Madrid attacks|terrorist attacks]] occurred in [[Madrid]] on 11 March, which were initially blamed on [[ETA]] and later on [[Al-Qaeda]]. Aznar's government and Party leaders insisted on accusing the armed Basque separatist organisation ETA of the attacks, and on 13 March, Rajoy claimed to believe this because he was convinced of their will and capability for committing such crimes,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/papel/2004/03/13/espana/1606169.html |title=Ahora sería bueno que hubiera un gobierno con mayoría absoluta|publisher=El Mundo|date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government was accused of attempting to blame ETA for the attacks in order to stay on track to win the elections (as they were heavily favored to do), but then news broke that it was Al-Qaida, rather than ETA. 

On 14 March 2004 the PSOE, under the leadership of [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]], won the elections with a majority of 1,300,000 votes over the PP, and obtained 164 deputies, while the PP obtained 9,763,144 votes but 148 deputies, 35 less than they obtained in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.electionresources.org/es/congress.php?election=2004&amp;province=&lt;/ref&gt; Rajoy was elected for the province of [[Madrid (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Madrid]].

On 1 December 2005, Rajoy survived a helicopter accident, along with Madrid Regional Government President [[Esperanza Aguirre]]; he broke a finger in the accident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/12/01/madrid.crash/ CNN.com – Opposition leader survives Madrid helicopter crash – 1 Dec 2005]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rajoy faced a serious situation within his party after receiving public pressure from the electorally successful [[Alberto Ruiz Gallardón]] (Madrid's Mayor) to be included in the PP lists for the [[Spanish general election, 2008|March 2008 general election]]. Gallardón represents a more centrist sector within the party, whereas Rajoy, [[Angel Acebes]] and [[Eduardo Zaplana]] are widely accepted{{Vague|date=March 2008}} as representing a more conservative wing of the party, closer to Aznar{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}. Rajoy's final decision was to leave Gallardón out of the list for those elections, an action which provoked concern about the alienation of potential PP voters. Some experts and newspapers even argued that it could cost Rajoy the elections{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}. In any case, the power struggle for succession created a tense situation for him and for the party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a00a6290-c451-11dc-a474-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1 FT.com / World – Madrid mayor barred by own party&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 January 2008, Rajoy received the support of Germany's [[Angela Merkel]] and France's [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] for the March 2008 general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elimparcial.es/contenido/2087.html |title=Sarkozy y Merkel desean de &quot;todo corazón&quot; el triunfo de Mariano Rajoy |publisher=Elimparcial.es |date=2008-01-30 |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/videos/espana/Sarkozy/Merkel/le/desean/gran/exito/Rajoy/elpvidnac/20080130elpepunac_12/Ves/ |title=Video: Sarkozy y Merkel le desean &quot;un gran éxito&quot; a Rajoy |publisher=Elpais.com |date=2008-01-30 |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PP was defeated in the general election, however, and Rajoy continued to lead his party in opposition.

His criticisms of the Zapatero administration were focused on what he perceived as:

*The derogation of ambitious plans of the previous executive
**The ''Plan Hidrológico Nacional'' National Hydrological Plan
** The ''LOCE'' Organic Law on the Quality of Education
* The alleged &quot;unnecessary&quot; statutory reforms, such as submitted in the [[Catalonia|Catalan]], and [[Andalusia]]n referendums with very high levels of abstention. According to Rajoy, some of those reforms constitute concealed changes of the autonomous communities towards a confederation, endangering the integrity of the State. He has said that if Zapatero wants to apply his view of Spain, it would be better if he proposed a reform of the [[Spanish Constitution]], a reform that would need approval in a national referendum.
*The alleged weakness facing the peace process opened as a result of the permanent ceasefire declared by the organisation ETA in 2006, broken by the [[2006 Madrid Barajas International Airport bombing|Barajas bombing]] and the arms robbery.{{Specify|date=February 2009}}
*The introduction of a citizenship subject in the last years of secondary education (''Educación para la Ciudadanía'') of polemic content (whose opponents, counting the Catholic Church, and affiliated organisations, say is non-neutral and gives some left-wing political indoctrination). Rajoy announced its cancellation.
*The legalization of abortion until 14 weeks of pregnancy, a law that Mariano Rajoy sees as &quot;criminal&quot; and against the will of large sectors of the Spanish society.
*In [[Foreign policy]]
**The alleged cold relations with United States and Poland.
**The alliances with [[Venezuela]] and [[Hugo Chávez]], [[Cuba]] and [[Fidel Castro|Castro]] and [[Bolivia]] and [[Evo Morales]].
**Immigration policy.

===Prime Minister===
Following the [[Spanish general election, 2011|general election]] held in 2011, Rajoy was elected Prime Minister by the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]] on 21 December 2011.

'''María Teresa Fernández de la Vega Sanz''', [[Doctor of Laws|LLD]] (born 15 June 1949) is a [[Spaniard|Spanish]] [[Valencian people|Valencian]] [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist]] politician. From 18 April 2004 to 20 October 2010, she was the [[First Vice President (Spain)|First Deputy Prime Minister]], Minister of the Presidency and Cabinet Spokesperson in the government of Spanish Prime Minister [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpr.es/VicepresidentaPrimera/Biografia/biografia.htm Ministry of Presidency - First Vice Presidency of the Government of Spain]&lt;/ref&gt; She is the first female Deputy Prime Minister in Spanish history.

==Biography==
María Teresa Fernández de la Vega Sanz is the daughter of a high-ranking [[Spain under Franco|Francoist]] public servant, Wenceslao Fernández de la Vega Lombán, delegate of the [[Ministry of Employment]] headed at that time by Fermín Sanz Orrio (1957–1962). She earned a degree in [[Law]] in the [[Complutense University of Madrid]] in the early 1970s. She subsequently moved to [[Barcelona]], where she became a Doctor of Law. In 1974 she entered Spain's ''Cuerpo de Secretarios Jurídicos Laborales'', a specialised body of the civil service.

She started her political career in the [[Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia]], remaining a member of it until 1979. From 1982 until 1985, she was the Director of the Advisory Cabinet of the Minister of the Justice, and in 1985 she was appointed General Director of Services at the Ministry of Justice. In 1986 she became a member of the Legal Cooperation Committee of the [[Council of Europe]]. In 1990, she was chosen as a spokesperson of the [[General Council of the Judicial Power of Spain]] by decision of the [[Spanish Senate|Senate]] (1994–1996). On May 13, 1994, the then Minister [[Juan Alberto Belloch]] appointed her [[Secretary of State]] of Justice.

She was elected a Member of the [[Spanish Congress]] for [[Jaén (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Jaén]] in the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] candidacy for the 1996-2000 term, being re-elected in the elections of 2000 for [[Segovia (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Segovia]]. During this term she became General Secretary of the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist]] Parliamentary Group. In the [[Spanish general election, 2004|Spanish general election of 2004]] she became a Member of Parliament for [[Madrid (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Madrid]], and on 18 April of that year she was appointed [[First Vice President (Spain)|First Vice President of the Government]] and [[Minister of Presidency]], remaining the incumbent of each. For the 2008 election she headed the list for the PSOE in [[Valencia (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|Valencia]].

María Teresa Fernández de la Vega was the first woman to take on the functions of the [[Prime Minister of Spain|President of government]] in the history of [[Modern Spain|Spanish democracy]], when, on April 24, 2004, during the first official visit abroad of Spain's prime minister, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, she presided over the Council of Ministers.

In March 2006 the First Vice President went on an African tour with the State Secretary for Cooperation, [[Leire Pajín]], visiting [[Kenya]] and [[Mozambique]], in whose capital, [[Maputo]], they celebrated [[International Women's Day]] and closed the forum &quot;Spain-Africa: Women for a better world&quot;.

In 7 October 2006 she received the [[Francisco Tomás y Valiente|Tomás y Valiente]] Award in [[Fuenlabrada]], [[Madrid]].

Fernández de la Vega has a degree in Communitarian [[Law]] from the University of [[Strasbourg]] and is a member of Justices for democracy (Jueces para la Democracia). She has written many papers, including ''La reforma de la jurisdicción laboral'' and ''Derechos humanos y Consejo de Europa''.

The current office is established under the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Constitution of 1978]]. The [[Monarchy of Spain|King of Spain]] nominates a candidate for the presidency who stands before the Congress of Deputies for a Vote of Confidence in a process known as a ''Congressional [[Investiture]]'', effectively an [[indirect election]] of the [[head of government]] by the elected Congressional delegates.

[[Mariano Rajoy Brey]] of the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] as been the prime minister since he was sworn in on December 21, 2011, after winning the [[Spanish general election, 2011|2011 general election]].

==Official title==
The Spanish head of government is known, in Spanish, as the ''Presidente del Gobierno de España''. Literally translated, the title is &quot;President of the Government of Spain&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;moncloa&quot;&gt;[http://www.la-moncloa.es/IDIOMAS/9/Presidente/Biografia/default.htm Official web site of La Moncloa, the Spanish Prime Minister's Office] Accessed 2009-03-05&lt;/ref&gt; or alternatively &quot;Chairman of the Government&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Spanish Dictionary and Grammar'', ed. C.Lea ''et al.'', 2nd ed.(2001)&lt;/ref&gt; but nevertheless the office-holder is commonly referred to in English as the &quot;[[prime minister]]&quot;, the usual term for the head of government in a [[parliamentary system]]. However the Spanish for 'prime minister' is ''primer ministro''; thus, for example, the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] is the ''Primer Ministro del Reino Unido'', not the ''Presidente del Gobierno''.

In Spain the head of the government is often called simply ''Presidente'', meaning 'President'. This sometimes causes confusion since it is the usual term for the head of government in a republic; former governor of Florida [[Jeb Bush]] once mistakenly referred to the &quot;President of the Republic of Spain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Jeb/Bush/agradece/apoyo/presidente/Republica/espanola/elpepiesp/20030218elpepinac_7/Tes El País 18/02/2003. &quot;Jeb Bush Thanks the support of the &quot;President of the Spanish Republic&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The custom to name the head of government as &quot;President&quot; dates back to the reign of [[Isabella II of Spain]], when the official title was ''Presidente del Consejo de Ministros'' (&quot;President of the Council of Ministers&quot;). Before 1833 the figure was known as ''Secretario de Estado'' (&quot;Secretary of State&quot;), a denomination used today for [[junior minister]]s.

==Royal nomination and congressional confirmation==
Once a [[Elections in Spain|general election]] has been announced by the king, political parties nominate their candidates to stand for the presidency of the government. An outgoing president who is not running in that election remains in office as a caretaker until their successor is sworn in, such as [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]]; this differs from other parliamentary governments whose prime ministers always lead their parties during the election campaign.

Following the general election of the [[Cortes Generales]] (''Cortes''), and other circumstances provided for in the constitution, the king meets with and interviews the [[List of political parties in Spain|political party leaders]] represented in the Congress of Deputies, and then consults with the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Speaker of the Congress of Deputies]] (officially, ''Presidente de Congreso de los Diputados de España'', who, in this instance, represents the ''whole'' of the Cortes Generales and was himself elected from within the Congress to be the Speaker) before nominating his candidate for the presidency, according to Section 99 of Title IV.&lt;ref name=&quot;King and Prime Minister&quot;&gt;[http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Constituci%C3%B3n_espa%C3%B1ola_de_1978:_06 Part IV Government and Administration]&lt;/ref&gt; Often minor parties form part of a larger major party, and through that membership it can be said that the king fulfills his constitutional mandate of consulting with party representatives with Congressional representation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Title IV Government and Administration
Section 99(1) &amp; (2)
*(1) After each renewal of the Congress and the other cases provided for under the Constitution, the King shall, after consultation with the representatives appointed by the political groups with parliamentary representation, and through the Speaker of the Congress, nominate for the Presidency of the Government.
*(2) The candidate nominated in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing subsection shall submit to the Congress the political program of the Government he or she intends to form and shall seek the confidence of the House.&lt;ref name=&quot;King and Prime Minister&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Artículo 99.

*1.'' Después de cada renovación del Congreso de los Diputados, y en los demás supuestos constitucionales en que así proceda, el Rey, previa consulta con los representantes designados por los grupos políticos con representación parlamentaria, y a través del Presidente del Congreso, propondrá un candidato a la Presidencia del Gobierno.''
*2. ''El candidato propuesto conforme a lo previsto en el apartado anterior expondrá ante el Congreso de los Diputados el programa político del Gobierno que pretenda formar y solicitará la confianza de la Cámara.''&lt;ref name=&quot;King and Prime Minister&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Constitutionally, the monarch may nominate anyone he sees fit as his prerogative. However, it remains pragmatic for monarch to nominate a candidate who is most likely to enjoy the confidence of the Congress of Deputies and [[Government of Spain|form a government]], usually the political leader whose party commands the most seats in the Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;King and Prime Minister&quot;/&gt; For the Crown to nominate the political leader whose party controls the Congress can be seen as a royal endorsement of the democratic process— a fundamental concept enshrined in the 1978 Constitution.

By [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|political custom]] established by [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]] since the ratification of the 1978 Constitution, the king's nominees have all been from parties who maintain a plurality of seats in the Congress. However, there is no legal requirement for this. It has never happened in the national government, but the largest party could end up not ruling if rival parties gather into a majority, forming a [[coalition]]. This scenario is unlikely as political activity in Spain has effectively coalesced into a [[two-party system]] between the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] and the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]], with the two major parties adopting some aspects of the minor party platforms in an effort to attract them into a coalition to edge out their rival party.

The monarch is normally to able announce his nominee the day following a general election.

The monarch's order nominating a presidential candidate is countersigned by the Speaker of the Congress, who then presents the nominee before the Congress of Deputies in a process known as a ''[[Investiture|Congressional Investiture]]'' (''Investidura parlamentaria''). During the Investiture proceedings the nominee presents his [[manifesto|political agenda]] in an ''Investiture Speech'' to be debated and submitted for a [[Vote of Confidence]] (''Cuestión de confianza'') by the Congress, effecting an [[indirect election]] of the head of government.&lt;ref name=&quot;King and Prime Minister&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;08 April 2008 Investiture Speech&quot;&gt;[http://www.la-moncloa.es/IDIOMAS/9/Presidente/Discursodeinvestidura/Introduction.htm Speech by Zapatero at the session for his investiture as President]&lt;/ref&gt; A simple majority confirms the nominee and his program.&lt;ref name=&quot;King and Prime Minister&quot;/&gt;  At the moment of the vote, the confidence is awarded if the candidate receives a majority of votes in the first poll (currently 176 out of 350 MPs), but if the confidence is not awarded, a second vote is scheduled two days later in which a simple majority of votes cast (i.e., more &quot;yes&quot; than &quot;no&quot; votes) is required.

After the nominee is confirmed, the Speaker of the Congress formally reports to the king of the congressional confirmation. The king then appoints the candidate as the new President of the Government. The king's order of appointment is countersigned by the Speaker. During the inauguration ceremony performed by the king, customarily at the ''Salón de Audiencias'' in the [[Palacio de la Zarzuela|Zarzuela Palace]], the [[president elect]] of the Government takes an [[oath of office]] over an open constitution and next to the [[Holy Bible]]. The oath as taken by President Zapatero on his first term in office on 17 April 2004 was;&lt;ref name=&quot;zapatero_sworn_in&quot;&gt;{{es icon}} Video: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM3AZ47GZ0w Rodríguez Zapatero is sworn in to his second term] ([[RTVE]]'s [[Canal 24 Horas|Canal 24H]], April 12, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;:

}}

In 2008, from the time the king nominated [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] for a second term as president immediately following the 2008 general election, almost a month passed before Zapatero was able to present his Investiture Speech before the Congress and stand for a Vote of Confidence.&lt;ref name=&quot;08 April 2008 Investiture Speech&quot;/&gt; If no overall majority was obtained on the first Vote of the Confidence, then the same nominee and program is resubmitted for a second vote within forty-eight hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;King and Prime Minister&quot;/&gt; Following the second vote, if confidence by the Congress is still unreached, then the monarch again meets with political leaders and the Speaker, and submits a new nominee for a vote of confidence.&lt;ref name=&quot;King and Prime Minister&quot;/&gt; If, within two months, no candidate has won the confidence of the Congress then the King dissolves the Cortes and calls for a new general election.&lt;ref name=&quot;King and Prime Minister&quot;/&gt; The King's royal decree is countersigned by the Speaker of the Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;King and Prime Minister&quot;/&gt;

Once appointed, the President of the Government forms his government whose ministers are appointed and removed by the King on the president's advice. In the political life of Spain, the king would already be familiar with the various political leaders in a professional capacity, and perhaps less formally in a more social capacity, facilitating their meeting following a general election. Conversely, nominating the party leader whose party maintains a plurality and who are already familiar with their party [[manifesto]] facilitates a smoother nomination process. In the event of [[Coalition government|coalitions]], the political leaders would customarily have met beforehand to hammer out a coalition agreement before their meeting with the King.

Governments and the Cortes sit for a term no longer than four years when the president tenders his resignation to the king and advises the king to dissolve the Cortes, prompting a general election. It remains within the king's prerogative to dissolve the Cortes if, at the conclusion of the four years, the president has not asked for its dissolution, according to Title II Section 56.&lt;ref&gt;Title II Section 56 the monarch is the &quot;arbitrator and moderator of the regular functioning of the institutions&quot;, &quot;arbitra y modera el funcionamiento regular de las instituciones&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The king may call for earlier elections on the advice of the president, known as a [[snap election]], but no sooner than a year after the prior general election.&lt;ref&gt;Snap elections have been used only threes since the 1978 Constitution was ratified, ex-PM [[Felipe González]] invoked his constitutional right to dissolve the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] three times in 1989, 1993 and 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, if the Government loses the confidence of the Cortes, then it must resign.

In the event that a president dies or becomes incapacitated while in office, then the government as a whole resigns and the process of royal nomination and appointment takes place. The vice president would then take over the day to day operations in the meantime, even while the vice president himself may be nominated by the King and stand for a vote of confidence.

==Constitutional authority==
Title IV of the Constitution defines the government and its responsibilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;King and Prime Minister&quot;/&gt; The government consists of the [[Council of Ministers of Spain|President of the Government and ministers of state]]. The government conducts domestic and [[Foreign relations of Spain|foreign policy]], civil and military administration, and the [[Spanish Armed Forces|defense of the nation]] all in the name of the king on behalf of the people. Additionally, the government exercises executive authority and statutory regulations.&lt;ref name=&quot;King and Prime Minister&quot;/&gt; 

There is no provision in the Spanish Constitution for explicitly granting any [[emergency powers]] to the government, which could be understood as exorcizing the ghost of the recent [[Francoist Spain|dictatorship in Spain]]. However, Title II, Sections 56 of the constitution vests the monarch as the &quot;arbitrator and moderator of the institutions&quot; of government, ''[The King] arbitrates and moderates the regular functioning of the institutions'' (''arbitra y modera el funcionamiento regular de las instituciones'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiki Source Spa Constitution 78&quot;&gt;[http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Constituci%C3%B3n_espa%C3%B1ola_de_1978:_04 Título II. De la Corona, Wikisource]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Official website of the Royal Household&quot;&gt;[http://www.casareal.es/laCorona/laCorona-iden-idweb.html The Royal Household of H.M. The King website]&lt;/ref&gt; This provision could be understood as allowing the king or his government ministers to exercise emergency authority in times of national crisis, such as when the king used his authority to back the government of the day and call for the military to abandon the [[23-F|23-F coup attempt]] in 1981.

==Peerages==

[[Spanish nobility|Peerages in Spain]] are created by the Grace of the King, according to the Spanish Ministry of Justice, and are the highest marks of distinction that he may bestow in his capacity as the ''[[Fount of honour|fons honorum]]'' in Spain. Conventionally, the ''Title of Concession'' creating the dignity must be countersigned by a government minister. When a title is created for a former president, the succeeding president customarily countersigns the royal decree. As a reward for national service, the king awarded peerages to two of his former presidents who have since retired from active politics: [[Adolfo Suárez]] was created 1st [[Duke of Suárez]]; and [[Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo, 1st Marquess of la Ría de Ribadeo|Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo]] was created 1st [[Marquess of la Ría de Ribadeo]]. Additional titles of nobility have been created by the king for other government ministers, usually at the advice of the president of the government. 

As of 2005, the king has created 40 hereditary titles of nobility.

==Recent Presidents of the Government==
This is a list of the people who have held the office of President of the Government of Spain since the [[Spanish transition to democracy]]. For the full list since the predecessor office of Secretary of the Universal Bureau was created (1705), see [[List of Prime Ministers of Spain]].

'''Sonsoles Espinosa Díaz''' (born 8 November 1961) is a Spanish classical singer and music teacher. She is married to [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]], former [[Prime Minister of Spain|President of the Government]] (''Presidente del Gobierno'', essentially Prime Minister) of [[Spain]]. 

She was born in [[Ávila, Spain|Ávila]], the daughter of a military officer, and received a law degree from the [[Universidad de León]]. She met Rodríguez Zapatero in [[León, León|León]] in 1981. They married on 27 January 1990 and have two daughters, born 1993 and 1995.

Sonsoles is a soprano and music teacher, and several times she stated she loves singing soft rock music. While living in [[León, Spain|León]], she was a member of the city's prestigious university choir and used to be a music teacher for 7 to 9 graders at one of León's and Spain's most prestigious schools, Colegio Leonés. Since moving to Madrid she has continued to sing, as a substitute member of the chorus at the city's opera house, the [[Teatro Real]], and more recently with the choir of the government-owned broadcasting service [[RTVE]].

In 2003, she gave an interview to the magazine ''La Razón'', where some of her opinions about abortion generated controversy, mainly from right-wing think tank groups. She said abortion should be legal in all countries and that &quot;those who don't understand this are people from the 18th century.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The '''Spanish Socialist Workers' Party''' ({{lang-es|Partido Socialista Obrero Español}} {{IPA-es|parˈtiðo soθjaˈlista oˈβrero espaˈɲol|}}  {{audio|es_partido-socialista-obrero-espanol_001.ogg|listen}}; '''PSOE''' {{IPA-es|peˈsoe|}}  {{audio|es_psoe_001.ogg|listen}} ) is a [[social democracy|social-democratic]]&lt;ref name=&quot;parties-and-elections.de&quot;&gt;[http://www.parties-and-elections.de/spain.html Parties and Elections in Europe: The database about parliamentary elections and political parties in Europe, by Wolfram Nordsieck]&lt;/ref&gt; [[political party]] in [[Spain]]. Its political position is Centre-left. The PSOE is the former ruling party of Spain, until beaten in the elections of November 2011 and the second oldest, exceeded only by the [[Carlism|Partido Carlista]], founded in 1833.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The PSOE has had strong ties with the [[Unión General de Trabajadores| General Union of Workers]] (UGT), a Spanish [[trade union]]. For decades, UGT membership was a requirement for PSOE membership. During the 1980s, though, UGT criticised the economic policies of the PSOE, even calling for a [[general strike]] on December 14, 1988.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

The PSOE recently lost the [[Spanish general election, 2011|general elections]] on 20 November 2011. The PSOE is a full member of the [[Party of European Socialists]] and the [[Socialist International]].&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psoe.es/ambito/historiapsoe/docs/index.do?action=View&amp;id=992 |title=History of PSOE|publisher=PSOE own site |accessdate=2007-07-11 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[European Parliament]], the PSOE's 21 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] sit in the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats|Socialists and Democrats]] [[Political groups of the European Parliament|European parliamentary group]].

== Ideology ==
The PSOE was founded with the purpose of representing the interests of the [[working class]] born from the [[Industrial Revolution]] with the declared objective of achieving [[socialism]], and inspired by the revolutionary principles of [[Marxism]].

After the 1979 extraordinary congress, the PSOE renounced Marxism as its main ideology, becoming a social-democratic party. Currently, the party has moved away from [[left-wing politics]], adopting a [[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]] approach and supporting free-market policies, including reforms to curtail the Spanish [[welfare state]].

==Early history (1879 - 1974)==

[[Image:Casa labra.jpg|250px|thumb|''Casa Labra'' Pub]]

The PSOE was founded on May 2, 1879 in the ''Casa Labra'' Pub (city of [[Madrid]]) by the historical Spanish workers' leader [[Pablo Iglesias]].&lt;ref name=History/&gt; The first program of the new political party was passed in an assembly of 40 people, on July 20 of that same year. Although the PSOE was rather weak during the late 19th century, its active participation in strikes from 1899 to 1902 and especially its electoral coalition with the main Republican parties led in 1910 to the election of Pablo Iglesias as the first Socialist representative in the [[Spanish Cortes]].

The party was a member of the [[Labour and Socialist International]] between 1923 and 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski, Werner. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=83QdPwAACAAJ Geschichte der sozialistischen arbeiter-internationale: 1923 - 19]''. Berlin: Dt. Verl. d. Wissenschaften, 1985. p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;

PSOE formed part of the Spanish government during the [[Second Spanish Republic]] and as part of the [[Spanish Popular Front]], elected to government in February 1936. During the civil war years, PSOE was divided into three wings: a leftist revolutionary [[Marxist]] wing, led by [[Francisco Largo Caballero]] that advocated [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], [[nationalization]] of every industry, and total redistribution of land; a moderate, social-democratic faction,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} led by [[Indalecio Prieto]]; and a reformist one, led by [[Julian Besteiro]].&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

The dictator [[Francisco Franco]] banned the PSOE in 1939, and the party was legalised again in 1977. During Franco's rule members of the PSOE was persecuted, with many leaders, members and supporters being imprisoned or [[exile]]d and even executed.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

==Modern history (1974 - present day)==
Its 25th Congress was held in [[Toulouse]] in August 1972. In 1974 at its 26th Congress in [[Suresnes]], [[Felipe González]] was elected Secretary General, replacing [[Rodolfo Llopis Ferrándiz]]. González was from the &quot;reform&quot; wing of the party, and his victory signaled a defeat for the historic and veteran wing of the Party. The direction of the party shifted from the exiles to the young people in Spain who hadn't fought the war.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

Llopis led a schism to form the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (historic)]] González showed intentions to move the party away from its [[Marxism|Marxist]] and [[socialism|socialist]] background, turning the PSOE into a social-democratic party, similar to those of the rest of western Europe. In 1977 PSOE became the official [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]] party with 29.2% of the vote and 118 seats in the [[Cortes Generales|Parliament]]. Their standing was further boosted in 1978 when the 6 deputies of the [[Popular Socialist Party (Spain)|Popular Socialist Party]] agreed to merge with the party.

In their 27th congress in May 1979 González resigned because the party would not abandon its Marxist character. In September the extraordinary 28th congress was called in which González was re-elected when the party agreed to move away from Marxism. European social-democratic parties supported González's stand, and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] granted them money. The PSOE party symbol was changed from the [[anvil with the book]] to the social-democratic [[rose]] in the fist, as used by the French [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]]. In the referendum of 1978, PSOE supported the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Spanish Constitution]], which was approved. In the [[Spanish general election, 1979|1979 Spanish general election]] the PSOE gained 30.5% of the vote and 121 seats, remaining the main opposition party.

At the 28 October [[Spanish general election, 1982|1982 Spanish general election]], the PSOE was victorious, with 48.5% of the vote (10,000,000 total). Felipe González became [[Prime Minister of Spain]] on 2 December, a position he held until March 1996.

Though the party had previously opposed [[NATO]], after reaching the government most party leaders supported keeping Spain inside the organisation. The González administration organised a referendum on the question in 1986, calling for a favourable vote, and won. The administration was criticised for avoiding the official names of ''North Atlantic Treaty Organisation'' and ''NATO'', using the unofficial ''Atlantic Alliance'' terms. A symbol of this U-turn is [[Javier Solana]] who campaigned against NATO but ended up years later as its Secretary General.

PSOE Supported the United States in the [[Gulf War]] (1991). The PSOE won the 1986, 1989 and 1993 general elections.

Economic crisis, several corruption scandals{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} and [[state terrorism]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} ([[Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación|GAL]]) against the violent separatist group [[ETA]] eroded the popularity of Felipe González, and in 1996, the PSOE lost the elections to the conservative [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP). Between 1996 and 2001 the PSOE weathered a crisis, with Gonzalez resigning in 1997. The PSOE suffered a heavy defeat in 2000 (34.7%).

The PSOE remained as the ruling party in the [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] of [[Andalusia]], [[Extremadura]], [[Castilla-La Mancha]] and [[Asturias]].

[[File:José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero - Royal &amp; Zapatero's meeting in Toulouse for the 2007 French presidential election 0205 2007-04-19b.jpg|thumb|right|[[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]]]]
In 2001, a new general secretary, [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] (also known as ZP), was elected, renewing the party. Later, the PSOE won the municipal elections of 2003.

PSOE strongly opposed to the [[Iraq War]], which was supported by the PP.

On 13 November 2003 the PSOE ([[Socialists' Party of Catalonia|Socialist Party of Catalonia]], PSC) increased its vote total but scored second in the regional election in [[Catalonia]], after [[Convergence and Union]]. After a period of negotiations, the party formed a pact with [[Republican Left of Catalonia]], [[Initiative for Catalonia Greens]] and the [[United and Alternative Left]], and have governed in Catalonia since then.

On 14 March 2004, the PSOE won the [[Spanish legislative election, 2004|2004 Spanish general election]] with almost 43% of the votes, following the [[11-M]] terrorist (March 11) attacks, and maintained their lead in the elections to the European Parliament.

In 2005, PSOE called for a Yes vote on the [[Treaty establishing a constitution for Europe|European Constitution]]. It has since legalised [[same-sex marriage in Spain|same-sex marriage]], and has called for further integration into the EU. PSOE also favoured the negotiations between the government and [[ETA]] during the 2006 cease-fire, which de-facto ended with the [[Barajas Airport]] [[2006 Madrid Barajas International Airport bombing|terrorist attack]].

On 9 March 2008 the PSOE won the [[Spanish general election, 2008|2008 Spanish general elections]] again with José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero remaining Prime Minister of Spain. The Socialists increased their share of seats in the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]] from 164 to 169 after the latest election.

However, after waning popularity throughout their second term, mainly due to their handling of the worsening economic climate in Spain in the aftermath of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, the PSOE were defeated in the [[Spanish general election, 2011|general elections of November 2011]], winning just 28.76% of the popular vote and handing the [[People's Party (Spain)|PP]] a landslide victory.

==Terms==
* '''[[Baron]]''': Unofficial term for the party's regional leaders. They can be very powerful, especially if they run an autonomous community. There have been conflicts between barons and the central directorate in the past. Some barons were [[Pasqual Maragall]] ([[Catalonia]]), who didn't run for re-election in 2006; [[Juan Carlos Rodríguez Ibarra]] ([[Extremadura]]), who didn't run for re-election in 2007; [[Manuel Chaves]] ([[Andalucia]]), who renounced Andalucia's presidency in 2009 to assume Third Vice Presidency of the Spanish Government; [[José Montilla]] ([[Catalonia]]), now opposition leader. The term barón is more colloquial than official, representing the great power regional leaders have in the party, but  its falling in disuse since 2008. 
* '''''Compañero''''' (&quot;companion&quot;, &quot;comrade&quot;): A term of address among Socialists, analogous to the English [[comrade]].
* '''Currents''': There have been several internal groups within PSOE, based on personal or ideological affinities. Some of them have ended with separation from the PSOE. The failed trial of [[primary election]]s for PSOE candidates was an attempt to conciliate currents. Examples of currents are &quot;Guerristas&quot; (followers of [[Alfonso Guerra]]), &quot;[[Renovadores]]&quot; (renewers, right wing of the Party) or Izquierda Socialista (Socialist Left).

The '''University of León''' is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[public university]] with [[campus]] in [[León, Spain|León]] and [[Ponferrada]].

The germ of the university is found in [[1843]], when it was created the Normal School for Teachers or Masters Seminar of Public Instruction and the subaltern school of Veterinary Medicine, founded in [[1852]], laying the foundations of Leon future university. Founded in [[1979]] as a splitting of the [[University of Oviedo]], from the various schools and colleges that depend on that, more or less existed long ago in the city of [[Leon, Spain|Leon]].

In recent years the university has signed important cooperation agreements, among which the one signed with the [[University of Washington]], which has allowed the installation in [[León, Spain|Leon]] of the second European Headquarters this university to learn Spanish, with capacity for 500 students, and signed with the [[University of Xiangtan]], which has led to the establishment in the city of [[Confucius Institute]].

== Faculties and Schools ==

'''Valladolid''' ({{IPA-es|baʎaðoˈlið|lang|Valladolid.ogg}}) is a historic city and [[municipalities of Spain|municipality]] in north-central Spain, situated at the confluence of the [[Pisuerga River|Pisuerga]] and [[Esgueva]] rivers, and located within three wine-making regions: [[Ribera del Duero]], [[Rueda (DO)|Rueda]] and [[Cigales]]. It is the capital of the [[province of Valladolid]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Braun Valladolid UBHD.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Vallisoletum'', 1574 by Braun and Hogenberg.]]

One line of etymological argument suggests that the modern name &quot;Valladolid&quot; derives from a [[Celtiberian language]] expression, ''Vallis Tolitum'' (&quot;Waters Valley&quot;), due to the confluence of rivers. Another, more generally accepted derivation is from the demonym ''Vallisoletano'', which was, in fact, the Spanish [[demonym]] of the city, and means &quot;from sunny valley&quot;. Supporting this are texts from the Middle Ages, which use ''Vallisoletum'', a word which continued to be used as late as the 16th century (see painting by Braun and Hogenberg).  

It is also popularly called ''Pucela'', a nickname whose origin is not clear, but probably refers to a few knights who accompanied [[Joan of Arc]], known as La Pucelle. Another theory is that ''Pucela'' comes from the fact that Puzzeli's cement was sold there, the only city in Spain that sold it.

==History==

[[File:Torneo en la Plaza Mayor grande.jpg|thumb|left|'A [[jousting]] tournament in the main square of Valladolid', historical ceiling preserved in Prado Museum]]

Remains of [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] and of a [[ancient Rome|Roman]] camp have been excavated near the city. The nucleus of the city was originally located in the area of the current San Miguel y el Rosarillo square, and was surrounded by a palisade. Archaeological proofs of the existence of three ancient lines of walls have been found.

During the time of Moorish rule in Spain the Christian kings moved the population of this region north into more easily defended areas, and deliberately created a no-mans' land as a buffer zone against further Moorish conquests. The area was captured from the [[Moors]] in the 10th century,  and Valladolid was a village until king [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile]] donated it to count [[Pedro Ansúrez]] in 1072. He built a palace (now lost) for himself and his wife, countess Eylo, the Collegiate of St. Mary and the La Antigua churches. In the 12th and 13th centuries, Valladolid grew rapidly, thanks also to the commercial privileges granted by the kings [[Alfonso VIII of Castile|Alfonso VIII]] and [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X]], as well as to the repopulation of the area after the [[Reconquista]].

In 1469 Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] and King Ferdinand of Aragon were married in the city; by the 15th  century Valladolid was the residence of the [[kings of Castile]] and remained the capital of the [[Kingdom of Spain]] until 1561, when the city was destroyed by a fire and [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], born here, moved the capital to [[Madrid]], starting a period of decadence for Valladolid. In 1506 [[Christopher Columbus]] died in Valladolid in a house which is now a Museum dedicated to him. It was made the capital of the kingdom again between 1601 and 1606 by [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]]. The city was again damaged by a flood of the Pisuerga and Esgueva rivers.

[[File:Valladolid - Catedral.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Cathedral of Valladolid]]]]
Despite the damage to the old city by the 1960s economic boom, it still boasts a few architectural manifestations of its former glory. Some monuments include the [[unfinished building|unfinished]] [[Valladolid Cathedral|cathedral]], the [[Plaza Mayor, Valladolid|Plaza Mayor]] (Main Square), which was the template for [[Plaza Mayor of Madrid|that of Madrid]], and of other main squares throughout the former Spanish empire, the National Sculpture Museum, next to the church of Saint Paul, which includes Spain's greatest collections of polychrome wood sculptures, and the Faculty of Law of the [[University of Valladolid]], whose façade is one of the few surviving works by [[Narciso Tomei]], the same artist who did the transparente in [[Cathedral of Toledo|Toledo Cathedral]]. The Science Museum is next to Pisuerga river. The only surviving house of [[Miguel de Cervantes]] is also located in Valladolid. Although unfinished, [[Cathedral of Valladolid]] was designed by [[Juan de Herrera]], architect of [[El Escorial]].

==Main sights==
The capital of Castile y León preserves in its old quarter  heritage of aristocratic houses and religious buildings.

===Interesting religious buildings===

*The unfinished [[Cathedral of Valladolid|Cathedral]], commissioned by King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and designed by the architect [[Juan de Herrera]] in the 16th century, following a mannierist style perhaps influenced by [[Michelangelo]]. The church is unfinished due to financial problems and its nave was not opened until 1668. Years later, in 1730, Master [[Churriguera]] finished the work on the main front. Inside the cathedral, the sanctuary houses a [[reredos]] made by [[Juan de Juni]] in 1562. The complex is linked to the Diocesan Museum, which holds carvings attributed to [[Gregorio Fernández]] and Juni himself, as well as a silver [[monstrance]] by [[Juan de Arce]].
*The large Gothic church of San Benito, built by the Benedictines between 1500 and 1515, with an unusual tower.
*San Miguel Church, antient church of the Jesuits (now, parish church), built at the end of the 16th century, hosts some reredos by the early 17th-century sculptor Gregorio Fernández.
*The façade of the Dominic's Church of [[San Pablo Church|San Pablo]], characterized by Gothic statues and decoration built around 1500.
*El Salvador Church, with a façade built around 1550, a 15th-century Flemish reredos and a brick tower dating from the 17th century.
*The church of Santiago has reredos depicting the ''Adoration of the Magi'' (1537) created by [[Berruguete]] and, in the sanctuary, a great baroque reredos depicting [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]] killing moors, as usual in Spain.
*The Gothic [[Santa María La Antigua|church of Santa maría la Antigua]] has an unusual pyramid-shaped Romanesque tower from the 12th century and a 14th century gothic sanctuary, influenced by the Cathedgral of Burgos..
*The [[Santa María la Real de las Huelgas (Valladolid)|Convent of Santa María la Real de las Huelgas]], originally built about 1600, following Spanish mannierist tendencies.
*''Convento de Santa Ana'', a neoclassical building housing various paintings by [[Francisco de Goya]].

The heart of the old city is the 16th-century [[Plaza Mayor of Valladolid|Plaza Mayor]], presided over by a statue of [[Pedro Ansúrez|Count Ansúrez]] from 1903. On one side of it stands the [[City Hall]], an eclectic building dating from the beginning of the 20th century, crowned by a clock tower. In the nearby streets is the [[Palace of Los Pimentel]], today the seat of the Provincial Council, is one of the most important, as King Philip II was born here on 21 May 1527. The [[Valladolid Royal Palace|Royal Palace]] (where King Philip IV of Spain and Queen Anne of France, mother of Louis XIV were born), the 16th-century Palace of the Marquises of Valverde, and that of the banker [[Fabio Nelli]] – a building with a Classicist stamp built in 1576 – should also be pointed out. The Museum of Valladolid occupies this complex, exhibiting a collection of furniture, sculptures, paintings and ceramic pieces dated from Prehistoric times to the present.

The [[Teatro Lope de Vega, Valladolid|Teatro Lope de Vega]] is a theater built in the classical style in 1861 and now very run-down. There has been controversy over whether the city should pay to restore it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Demografía Valladolid (España).PNG|thumb|right|300px|Population of Valladolid (1900&amp;ndash;2005)]]

==Population==
As of the 2004 census, the population of the city of Valladolid proper was 321,713, and the population of the entire urban area was estimated to be near 420,000. After the new neighbourhoods developed in last decades (one example would be [[Covaresa]]) the high prices in the municipality lead the youth people to buy properties in towns around the city, so the population tend to fall in Valladolid but grow fast in the rest of the urban area (for example, [[Arroyo de la Encomienda]] or [[Zaratán]])

[[File:227021542 3b4805c63c b.jpg|thumb|Old streets in Valladolid]]

==Economy==
Valladolid is, economically speaking, the most important city of the autonomous community, having an important automobile industry ([[IVECO]], [[FASA-Renault]], [[Michelin]]).

==Transportation==
There is an airport at nearby Villanubla (10&amp;nbsp;km of Valladolid city centre), with connections to London-Stansted, Paris, Brussels&amp;ndash;[[Charleroi]], [[Milan]], [[Lisbon]], [[Düsseldorf]], [[Barcelona]], [[Málaga]], [[Alicante]], [[Balearic Islands]] and [[Canary Islands]].

==Seminci==
{{main|Valladolid International Film Festival}}
The city is also host to one of the foremost (and oldest) international film festivals, the ''Semana Internacional de Cine de Valladolid ([[Seminci]])'', founded in 1956.

==Local cuisine==
[[File:ArrozLeche-Cubero-2009.jpg|thumb|The ''Arroz con Leche''.]]
[[File:Pasteles-San Lorenzo-Valladolid-2009.jpg|thumb|''Pasteles de San Lorenzo'']]

Although an inland province, fish is commonly consumed. Brought from the [[Bay of Biscay|Cantabrian Sea]], fish like red bream and hake are a major part of Valladolid's cuisine.

The main speciality of Valladolid is, however, lechazo (suckling baby lamb). The lechazo is slowly roasted in a wood oven and served with salad.

Valladolid also offers a great assortment of wild mushrooms. Asparagus, endive and beans can also be found. Some legumes, like white beans and lentils are particularly good. Pine nuts are also produced in great quantities.

Sheep cheese from Villalón de Campos, the famous pata de mulo (mule's leg) is usually unripened (fresh), but if it is cured the ripening process brings out such flavour that it can compete with the best sheep cheeses in Spain.

In the area of bread Valladolid has a bread to go with every dish, like the delicious cuadros from Medina del Campo, the muffins, the pork-scratching bread and the lechuguinos, with a pattern of concentric circles that resemble a head of lettuce.

The pastries and baked goods from the province of Valladolid are well-known, specially St. Mary's ring-shaped pastries, St. Claire's sponge cakes, pine nut balls and cream fritters.

Valladolid is also a producer of wines. The ones that fall under the Designation of Origin [[Cigales]] are very good. White wines from [[Rueda (DO)|Rueda]] and red wines from [[Ribera del Duero]] are known for their quality.

==Easter==

&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Holy Week in Spain]] --&gt;
Easter holds (&quot;Semana Santa&quot; in Spanish) one of the best known Catholic traditions in Valladolid. The Good Friday processions are considered an exquisite and rich display of Castilian religious sculpture. On this day, in the morning, members of the brotherhoods on horseback make a poetic proclamation throughout the city. The &quot;Sermon of the Seven Words&quot; is spoken in Plaza Mayor Square. In the afternoon, thousands of people take part in the Passion Procession, comprising 31 pasos (religious statues), most of which date from the 16th and 17th centuries. The last statue in the procession is the Virgen de las Angustias, and her return to the church is one of the most emotional moments of the celebrations, with the Salve Popular sung in her honour.

Easter is one of the most spectacular and emotional fiestas here. Religious devotion, art, colour and music combine in acts to commemorate the death of Jesus Christ: the processions. Members of the different Easter brotherhoods, dressed in their characteristic robes, parade through the streets carrying religious statues (pasos) to the sound of drums and music – scenes of sober beauty.
