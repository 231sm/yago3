The  [[port of Hamburg]]  is the third-largest port in Europe (third to [[Port of Antwerp]] and [[Port of Rotterdam|Rotterdam]]), and the eighth largest in the world.

Hamburg's official name is the ''Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg'' (German: ''Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg'').&lt;ref name=constitution&gt;[[Constitution of Hamburg]] {{Citation |title=Verfassung der Freien und Hansestadt Hamburg |url=http://hh.juris.de/hh/gesamt/Verf_HA.htm#Verf_HA_rahmen |date=1952-06-06 |edition=11th |accessdate=2008-09-21 }} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It makes reference to [[History of Hamburg|Hamburg's history]] as a member of the medieval [[Hanseatic League]], as a [[free imperial city]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and also to the fact that Hamburg is a [[city-state]] and one of the sixteen [[States of Germany]].

Hamburg is a major transportation hub in [[Northern Germany]] and is one of the most affluent cities in Europe.  It has become a media and industrial center, with factories such as ''[[Airbus]]'', ''[[Blohm + Voss]]'' and ''[[Aurubis]]''. The radio and television broadcaster ''[[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]]'' and publishers such as ''[[Gruner + Jahr]]'' and [[Der Spiegel|Spiegel]]-Verlag represent the important media industry in Hamburg. In total there are more than 120,000 enterprises. The city is a major tourist destination both for domestic and overseas visitors, receiving about 7.7&amp;nbsp;million overnight stays in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statistik-nord.de/uploads/tx_standocuments/Tourismus_HH_0812.pdf |title=Overnight stays in 2008 |work=Northern Germany statistics office (Statistikamt Nord) |language=German |accessdate=2009-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Hamburg}}
[[File:Map hamburg 1800.png|thumb|300px|Hamburg in 1800]]
The city takes its name from the first permanent building on the site, a fortress ordered built by Emperor [[Charlemagne]] in 808 AD.  The [[castle]] was built on rocky ground in a marsh between the [[Alster|River Alster]] and the [[Elbe|River Elbe]] as a defence against [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] incursion.  The castle was named ''Hammaburg'', where ''burg'' means fortress.  The ''Hamma'' element remains uncertain,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;cite id=Verg&gt;{{Citation |last1=Verg |first1=Erich |last2=Verg |first2=Martin |year=2007 |title=Das Abenteuer das Hamburg heißt |edition=4th |location= Hamburg |publisher= Ellert&amp;Richter |isbn= 9783831901371 |page=8}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does the location of this fortress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hammaburg &amp;ndash; der große Irrtum |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2007/12/12/826430.html |date=2007-12-12 |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |accessdate=2008-09-30}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 834, Hamburg was designated the seat of a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Prince-Bishop|bishopric]], whose first bishop, [[Ansgar]], became known as the Apostle of the North. Two years later, Hamburg was united with [[Archdiocese of Bremen|Bremen]] as the bishopric of Hamburg-Bremen.&lt;ref name=verg15&gt;[[#Verg|Verg (2007)]], p.15&lt;/ref&gt; In 1529, the city embraced [[Lutheranism]], and Hamburg subsequently received [[Protestantism|Protestant]] refugees from the [[Netherlands]] and [[France]] and, in the 17th century, [[Portuguese Jewish community in Hamburg|Sephardi Jews]] from [[Portugal]].

Hamburg was destroyed and occupied several times. In 845, a fleet of 600 [[Viking]] ships came up the [[Elbe|River Elbe]] and destroyed Hamburg, at that time a town of around 500 inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;verg15&quot;/&gt; In 1030, the city was burned down by King [[Mieszko II Lambert]] of [[Poland]]. [[Valdemar II of Denmark]] raided and occupied Hamburg in 1201 and in 1214. The [[Black Death]] killed at least 60% of Hamburg's population in 1350.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Snell |first=Melissa |url=http://historymedren.about.com

'''Hamburg''' is a village in [[Calhoun County, Illinois|Calhoun County]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]]. The population was 126 at the [[United States Census 2000|2000 census]].

==Geography==
Hamburg is located at {{coord|39|13|53|N|90|42|58|W|type:city}} (39.231277, -90.716207).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the village has a total area of 0.7&amp;nbsp;square miles (1.7&amp;nbsp;km²), of which, 0.5&amp;nbsp;square miles (1.3&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.1&amp;nbsp;square miles (0.3&amp;nbsp;km²) of it (19.70%) is water.

==History==
One hundred lots in the town of Hamburg were offered for sales by John Shaw in 1836.  Once a thriving river community where apples were loaded and shipped, banks were busy and profitable, stores were laden with goods and shoppers, Hamburg now sits quietly along and sometimes in the waters of the Mississippi.  The population is 150, give or take a few, and the only public facility is the Hamburg Post Office.  A bluff top monument overlooks the village, indicating the burial of riverboat Captain Swarnes who wished to be buried upright to command a panoramic view of the river.  In 1975, National Geographic published a two-page picture with the Delta Queen heading up the Mississippi using Captain Swarnes' monument as the photographer's vantage point.

==Demographics==
As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2000, there were 126 people, 60 households at a value of $79,982.64, and 39 families residing in the village. The [[population density]] was 241.5 people per square mile (93.6/km²). There were 94 housing units at an average density of 180.2/sq&amp;nbsp;mi (69.8/km²). The racial makeup of the village was 99.91% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], and 0.09% from two or more races.

There were 60 households out of which 25.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 51.7% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 8.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 35.0% were non-families. 35.0% of all households were made up of individuals and 16.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.
