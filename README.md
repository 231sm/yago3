<!-- TODO: update number of entities / facts -->

YAGO is a huge semantic knowledge base, derived from Wikipedia WordNet and GeoNames. Currently, YAGO has knowledge of more than 10 million entities (like persons, organizations, cities, etc.) and contains more than 120 million facts about these entities.

YAGO is special in several ways:

* The accuracy of YAGO has been manually evaluated, proving a confirmed accuracy of 95%. Every relation is annotated with its confidence value.
* YAGO combines the clean taxonomy of WordNet with the richness of the Wikipedia category system, assigning the entities to more than 350,000 classes.
* YAGO is an ontology that is anchored in time and space. YAGO attaches a temporal dimension and a spacial dimension to many of its facts and entities.
* In addition to a taxonomy, YAGO has thematic domains such as "music" or "science" from WordNet Domains.
* YAGO extracts and combines entities and facts from 10 Wikipedias in different languages.

YAGO is at jointly developed at the [DBWeb group](http://dbweb.enst.fr/) at [Télécom ParisTech University](https://www.telecom-paristech.fr/), the [Databases and Information Systems group](http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/databases-and-information-systems/) at [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home/), and [Ambiverse](https://www.ambiverse.com/).

## Requirements

* Java 8
* Maven
* Python

## Downloads

You can download the facts generated by YAGO at its [homepage](http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/databases-and-information-systems/research/yago-naga/yago/downloads/)

## Usage

This section shows you how to build your own YAGO repository. In that process, you will be able to define (a) what languages to cover, and (b) if relevant to you, which specific [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org), and [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org) snapshots should be used during the build. Follow these steps to start the repository creation process:

### Prepare the YAGO configuration file and download the required resources

YAGO is configured using its configuration file. Use this [template](blob/master/configuration/yago.ini) to generate your own copy of that file. The following lines need adaptation:

```ini
reuse = true
yagoFolder = /Users/yago/yago3
languages = en, de, fr, nl, it, es, ro, pl, ar, fa

# Variant A
dumpsFolder = /Users/yago/yago3-dumps

# Variant B
wikipedias = /Users/yago/yago3-dumps/en/20160701/enwiki-20160701-pages-articles.xml
wikidata = /Users/yago/yago3-dumps/wikidatawiki/20160621/wikidata-20160621-all-BETA.ttl
commons_wiki = /Users/yago/yago3-dumps/commonswiki/20160621/commonswiki-20160621-pages-articles.xml
```

```yagoFolder``` denotes the directory where YAGO will put its output files. ```reuse``` indicates whether or not any previous output in that folder will be preserved or not. This feature is particularly relevant if you reconfigure the ```extractors``` parameter and would like to keep already created results around for speeding up subsequent builds. ```languages``` tells YAGO which language-specific Wikipedia snapshots will be taken into account and hence allows for building a multilingual knowledge graph. For this parameter, use [ISO 639-1 language codes](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php).

#### Variant A

The ```dumpsFolder``` denotes the directory where YAGO will download the latest versions of all required resources into. Required resources are dumps of [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org), and [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org). The download needs to be invoked manually prior to running YAGO like this:

```bash
python /PATH_TO_YAGO3/scripts/dumps/downloadDumps.py -i PATH_TO_YAGOFOLDER -y PATH_TO_CONFIGURATION_FILE
```

```PATH_TO_YAGO3``` is the directory where you checked out this project to, ```PATH_TO_YAGOFOLDER``` corresponds to the ```yagoFolder``` property above, and ```PATH_TO_CONFIGURATION_FILE``` is your adapted copy of the [template](blob/master/configuration/yago.ini).

#### Variant B

Alternatively, you may choose to manually download the required resources and reference them in the configuration file (Variant B) as indicated in the aforementioned configuration snippet. That way, YAGO will pick those resources up during build, and no further steps are necessary at this time.

### Run YAGO

Once the configuration file has been prepared and all required resources have been downloaded, a YAGO build can be started like this:

```bash
cd PATH_TO_YAGO3
export MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx212G
mvn clean verify exec:java -Dexec.args=PATH_TO_CONFIGURATION_FILE
```

Again, ```PATH_TO_YAGO3``` is the directory where you checked out this project to and ```PATH_TO_CONFIGURATION_FILE``` is your adapted copy of the [template](blob/master/configuration/yago.ini). Allocating 212G of main memory to YAGO is a reasonable estimate which typically works fine, but of course this highly depends on the number of languages you execute the build for. Increase this value if necessary.

Once processing finished, all output can be found in the directory denoted by ```yagoFolder```in your configuration file.
