<!-- TODO: update number of entities / facts -->

YAGO is a huge semantic knowledge base, derived from Wikipedia WordNet and GeoNames. Currently, YAGO has knowledge of more than 10 million entities (like persons, organizations, cities, etc.) and contains more than 120 million facts about these entities.

YAGO is special in several ways:

* The accuracy of YAGO has been manually evaluated, proving a confirmed accuracy of 95%. Every relation is annotated with its confidence value.
* YAGO combines the clean taxonomy of WordNet with the richness of the Wikipedia category system, assigning the entities to more than 350,000 classes.
* YAGO is an ontology that is anchored in time and space. YAGO attaches a temporal dimension and a spacial dimension to many of its facts and entities.
* In addition to a taxonomy, YAGO has thematic domains such as "music" or "science" from WordNet Domains.
* YAGO extracts and combines entities and facts from 10 Wikipedias in different languages.

YAGO is at jointly developed at the [DBWeb group](http://dbweb.enst.fr/) at [Télécom ParisTech University](https://www.telecom-paristech.fr/), the [Databases and Information Systems group](http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/databases-and-information-systems/) at [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home/), and [Ambiverse](https://www.ambiverse.com/).

## Requirements

* Java 8
* Maven

## Usage

You can download the facts generated by YAGO at its [homepage](http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/databases-and-information-systems/research/yago-naga/yago/downloads/).

<!-- TODO: build instructions -->

You can build your own YAGO from Wikipedia and Wikidata snapshots by ...

## Configuration

YAGO uses a custom configuration file format. Make a copy of `configuration/yago.ini`, and adapt it for your purposes. Comments in that file describe the options.

# Architecture 

The overall goal of the YAGO architecture is to enable cooperation of several contributors, facilitate debugging and maintenance, and allow users to download only particular pieces of YAGO ("YAGO a la carte").  In short: YAGO is modular, both in code and in data.

The current architecture pursues the goal of modularity at the expense of longer running times and inefficiency.  The rationale is that we do not care if the extraction runs a few hours longer, if we can save a few hours of human work in return.

## Themes

The YAGO data is split into "themes". Themes can overlap, but should not. The union of all themes constitutes "YAGO full".

The class basics.Theme implements a theme.

## Extractors

An extractor is a unit of code that
* takes as input
  - one or more themes
  - a raw data file
* produces as output one or more themes

Every extraction module shall follow this scheme, i.e., implement extractors.Extractor. This defines a dependency graph of extractors.

Extractors are scheduled in the right order and called by main.Caller

## Final Themes 

Themes that are free of duplicates and ready for export are called "final themes". These live in the same folder as the other themes, but start with "yago...".  Final themes are constructed by finalExtractors.

## Techniques 

Facts can have a meta-fact `<extractionSource>`. This meta-fact can have a meta-fact `<extractionTechnique>`.  There should be a finite set of techniques that does not grow with the data.

Facts that do not have such an annotation are assumed to be trivially clean.

# Format 

The data format of YAGO is RDF/Turtle, as specified here: https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/#sec-grammar-grammar 

## Design Choices 
 
Turtle leaves some design choices open. We make the following conventions:
1. YAGO entities are always given as relative URIs `<Albert_Einstein>`. This is because qnames may not contain certain characters
2. All entities from standard namespaces are given as qnames This is to save space and keep readability.
3. All other entities are given as full URIs `<http://...>`
4. The encoding is UTF-8, backslash encodings are used only if necessary, and `\uXXXX` encodings are avoided wherever possible.

## Entities 

We use predefined RDF entities wherever possible, in particular 
    rdfs:domain, skos:prefLabel, rdfs:range, rdfs:label, rdfs:subClassOf,  
    rdfs:subPropertyOf, rdf:type, rdf:Resource, xsd:boolean, rdf:Class, 
    xsd:date, xsd:duration, rdf:Statement, xsd:integer, xsd:nonNegativeInteger, 
    xsd:decimal, xsd:decimal, rdf:Property, xsd:string, xsd:gYear, owl:Thing

We integrate XML types into the YAGO literal type hierarchy. We use YAGO literal types as literal types in RDF. The root of the taxonomy of individuals (formerly "entity") is owl:Thing.

## N4 

We extend RDF/Turtle by giving each triple an optional (!) fact id. This id is given in the line before the fact as a comment of the form
     #@ XXX
where XXX is a valid Turtle id for the following fact.

## Implementation 

Currently, all facts are in this format even inside the running program (i.e., inside Fact, FactCollection, etc.).
The implementation has to convert specifically to a Java String in order to work with real (16-bit) Java strings. This is done by FactComponent.asJavaString()

All frequent YAGO and RDFS string constants are declared in basics.YAGO and basics.RDFS, respectively.
