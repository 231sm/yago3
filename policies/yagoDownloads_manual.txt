How to update the YAGO downloads

1.
From the yago putput themes, convert TSV files to TTL files. For this you can use
basics3/src/basics/Tsv2Ttl.java

2.
Run Carte.java from yago3/src/utils/Carte.java to generate the carte.html file.

3. 
Run the compressYago.sh from yago3/scripts/compressYago.sh to compress tsv and ttl to 7z


4. 
Move all ttl.7z and tsv.tz files from 
/www/inf-resources-0/resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/yago-naga/yago/download/yago
to
the particular archive storage, for example to
/www/inf-resources-0/resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/yago-naga/yago3

Note that the first path is the actual download folder for yago.

5.
Move all newly generated ttl.7z and tsv.tz files (output of compressYago.sh script) to the web storage:
/www/inf-resources-0/resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/yago-naga/yago/download/yago

6. Arrange the html code for the downloads page in typo3 cms.
6.1 Replace the code from carte.html to the particular part of the downloads.html
6.2 Typo3 cms is under the url: https://web.mpi-inf.mpg.de/typo3/index.php
You need a direct access to MPI to use this system.

7. Test the download links from 
https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/databases-and-information-systems/research/yago-naga/yago/downloads/
whether they work properly.
