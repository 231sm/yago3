Bug ID:	1
Topic:	Duplicates
Reporter:	Steffen Metzger
Status:	TO DO
//////////////////////////////
In my YAGO2 version there are quite some duplicates (~300.000 facts
affected if my fact dumper did it right), but that may also
partially be because I added means entries and part of the problem may
stem from there. Anyway, attached you find a
list of all facts that are duplicates in my YAGO2, you may check with
your version if you like.

As for YAGO2S, just to check, I ran the following query to look for
duplicates in YAGO2S:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM yagofacts f1
INNER JOIN yagofacts f2 ON f1.subject=f2.subject and
f1.predicate=f2.predicate and f1.object=f2.object and f1.id!=f2.id

this gave a result of 107660 lines (this would mean ~50.000
affected facts, less if we some facts have more than two instances).

Bug ID:	2
Topic:	Upper-lower case in some types
Reporter:	Steffen Metzger
Status:	TO DO
//////////////////////////////
Another problem seems to be the writing of types, sometimes upper-and
lower case is mixed up. One instance that I also found in YAGO2S is the
wikicategory_German_physicists type, which appears sometimes also as
wikicategory_german_physicists (lower G), as for example in this fact:
Gustav_Zeuner   type    wikicategory_german_physicists

There is the same problem with "wikicategory_Time_travel_films"
and "wikicategory_time_travel_films"

(at least the first example should also be in YAGO2S, saw it in the
online browser)

This becomes a problem with case-sensitive tables/queries. I haven't
checked/seen other cases of this yet, so it may only be these instance,
but it could also be a systematic problem of some sort...

Topic:	owl:thing --> wordnet "medicine"
Reporter:	Marilena Oita
Status:	TO DO
//////////////////////////////
In the process of making the transitive closure of yagoTransityveTypes with wordnetDomains
 we discovered a I bug related to the fact that all entities of type owl:thing were associated with
  wordnet domain "medicine".
