Topic:  Upper-lower case in some types
Reporter: Steffen Metzger
Status: FIXED
Solution: Always capitalize the first letters of wikicategories.
//////////////////////////////
Another problem seems to be the writing of types, sometimes upper-and
lower case is mixed up. One instance that I also found in YAGO2S is the
wikicategory_German_physicists type, which appears sometimes also as
wikicategory_german_physicists (lower G), as for example in this fact:
Gustav_Zeuner   type    wikicategory_german_physicists

There is the same problem with "wikicategory_Time_travel_films"
and "wikicategory_time_travel_films"

(at least the first example should also be in YAGO2S, saw it in the
online browser)

This becomes a problem with case-sensitive tables/queries. I haven't
checked/seen other cases of this yet, so it may only be these instance,
but it could also be a systematic problem of some sort...
